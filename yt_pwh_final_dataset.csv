Python and in this section I want to teach you about what AI is when to use AI how to use AI what is the wrong way of using AI because I have seen a lot of developers using AI in a wrong way and I think you should avoid it and this mentorship session is I think very important for you so when to use AI let's talk about it whenever you want to work on a bigger application you will always be tempted with AI if you don't know what AI is there are a lot of tools in the market we'll explore them one by one you might already know about chat GPD you might know about different llms you might also know about open source llms many of you might have used it you haven't used it do not worry after this section you'll be able to use them to their full potential I'll teach you how so for the entirety of this course I did not talk about Ai and I also did not talk about llms and do you know the reason the reason for that is I wanted you to learn everything step by step there was a reason behind everything I did in this course and not using AI was a very conscious decision I did not use AI to teach you because I didn't wanted you to use AI during your learning one of the biggest mistakes students are making across the globe is that they are using AI while they are learning now you can use AI to learn but when you're using AI while learning and you are practicing your problems and then you are using AI to solve those problems you are not going to learn anything so use as minimum AI help in solving practice problems as possible you should be very very raw when you are learning especially your first programming language and if it is python I would say do not go for AI at the beginning so now let's talk about how to use AI once you are at a stage where you have practiced a lot of problems you now understand everything in Python You Now understand all the concepts object-oriented programming and whatnot everything is very very clear to you you have written say 100 practice programs now you are ready to use AI whenever you are working on a big application it's always recommended that you automate the repetitive boring task for example let us say you always find yourself writing functions like average of two numbers capitalizing a string or maybe you are writing a very special function which is getting rid of all the commas in a given string you can use AI for that so whenever you are working with a program or a big application you should definitely use AI to save your time but the problem with using a lot of AI is that people tend to lose control of their applications when they writing AI generated code and sometimes they don't realize that they are losing control of the application but most of the code written in the application is being controlled by Ai and when I say controlled by AI the code is AI generated and the senior developer who is taking control of that application who is managing everything doesn't know how a particular module is working so much so that he simply relies on AI and prompting that should not be the case with your application otherwise you'll come to a point where you'll not be able to debug your applications with that said we'll talk about about how to use AI what is the best way to use AI so I'll split this video into five strategies the number one strategy is divide and conquer you should not prompt your AI and say something like give me an e-commerce website AI can actually try its best to generate an e-commerce website and I'm not saying that it cannot do that but again your e-commerce website will have certain requirements AI doesn't know what kind of e-commerce website you want to build you can definitely tell all that using the the prompts but the problem is that if you take control of your code and you start building yourself start using the correct Frameworks let's say you want to use flask you should start by creating a flask app you should do everything step by step and then you should break down that entire problem of building an e-commerce website into smaller problems and those smaller chunks should be generated by AI that too if required this is really very important sometimes people get dependent on AI so much that they keep on giving prompts and they don't realize that they are actually wasting their time and also they are spoiling their application at the same time and AI cannot write very good code and the reason behind that is that a lot of code written by humans that AI is uh trained on is not the best code okay so if AI is trained on bad data it is going to generate bad data so number one advice that I want to give you on using AI is divide and conquer and for the repetitive chunks for the obvious chunks of your code for example you want to write a function that should process a string a certain way and return it in a certain way you can always prompt it and in most of the cases you can always test that code and also you can use that code because you are not basically asking the AI to write the entire application now people whenever they think about AI they tend to use chat GPT or Google Gemini and sometimes um they use other tools there are a lot of tools in the market but the thing is sometimes you have the correct tool in the market made specifically for a given task for example if you want to write code you can download GitHub cop pilot and it has a free tier and we'll talk about GitHub co-pilot um later in the section but let me tell you that GitHub co-pilot has a free tier and it's an AI code editor for everyone you can get started for free and if you are aggressively using it then definitely you'll have to pay but again the thing is that its plans and pricing are very good because for free you can start using it and you can install the vs code uh extension and then you can get 2,000 completions we'll come to this we'll install it later in this section but again if you have a tool specific to a certain task you should not prompt chat gbt and try to use that tool and if that tool doesn't work for you then you can maybe go for chat gbt sometimes we have specific tool for specific tasks let us say there is an AI just for converting designs to code you should use that AI instead of going to chat GPT and pasting images into chat GPT if that makes sense now strategy three is going to be be very very specific with your prompts take some time out and write good prompts instead of saying something like write an e-commerce app I'll say write an e-commerce app for my mobile store and I want to sell mobile phones laptops and say some other electronic devices you can always type specific things you want to sell specific Pages you want to build and specific requirements that your website should follow so if you put your prompts very correctly frame them very nicely specific to the requirements you are going to get better results humans have become very very lazy these days and I would like to attribute that to AI that you have become very very lazy and because of this laziness they tend to type very small prompt and they expect AI to do everything but that's not the case the better the prompt the better the result if you refine your prompts and if you create your prompt templates I'll tell you what is a prompt template but before that let me tell you that if you specifically type a given prompt for a given task it will always perform better let's say you want to debug your python code you can create a prompt template and save it in a txt file and whenever you want to debug your code you can have that prompt template and use that prompt template and use that prompt in chat GPT by making those tweaks in the same prompt now how does it help let us say you want to work on an application which is an e-commerce website written using flask and python you can type down the specific details of your application and then at the end ask the question about that application so your prompt will start something like hey I want to build an application using flask I'm using FL SQL Alchemy I'm also using let's say a class which does this it has these these function fun but I want to add some more functions I want to solve this specific problem how do I do it in Python okay or generate code for doing this in Python and then you can change the last line for doing something else so you have that template saved already and using the template you can always create new prompts and save time so you don't have to write or spend time writing longer prompts all the time because you have your application specific prompts inside a txt file and this really helps me when I build larger applications always remember that sometimes a good prompt can make a huge difference strategy number four is do not rely on AI too much use your human brain to solve or prepare solution of a problem and then use AI to implement the game plan always use AI as an assistant and do not replace thinking with AI I repeat think using your own brain and do not use AI for creativity or thinking because that is something AI cannot do strategy number five is that humans tend to use AI to solve their problems until unless they writing code for production they don't use AI whenever they are practicing they don't use AI but there is a better way to use AI while you are learning you can generate practice problems using Ai and then take control of the problem start solving it give your answer to chart GPD or whatever AI you are using and then that AI will tell you what you did right what you did wrong you can ask it how could I have done better it will tell you you could have done better by doing this so all these things are going to help you a lot if you use AI for learning because the B basic concepts can be practiced using AI you don't need a practice book you don't need a set of practice problems you can simply generate practice problems using Ai and then you can give solution to those problems to Ai and then you can ask AI how you did and AI will tell you which are the specific areas you need to focus on and always work on training your mind human mind do not try to memorize things always train your human mind and you'll train your human mind only after making a lot of mistakes solving problem the wrong way yes you heard that right solving problem the wrong way is going to teach you a lot of things once you make mistakes you'll realize that yeah I could have done it better and then you will learn how you can do tasks in the optimal fashion always remember that at the end of the day you will become a better developer if you sharpen your human mind so always focus on sharpening your human mind do not memorize things and do not rely on AI too much I hope that was helpful and in the next video we are going to look into some AI tools and we'll see how we can use them and leverage them for writing code see you in the next video",TRUE

control all the Wi-Fi networks that I have at home how cool would it be if I can control my devices from my app connected to my Wi-Fi network well fing is a network monitoring solution which helps you facilitate that and in this video we are going to explore it fing has around 22 million registered users 15 million plus scans and 4.5 plus trust pilot rating it is highly trusted for securing and managing network connections later in the video we'll see how we can install fing agent on this Rasberry Pi so that we can use the local apis that fing provides this video is going to be very fun I'm very excited to explore thinging let's move on to our computer screen and let's get started so as you can see I'm inside my computer screen and we are going to install fing so the very first thing that I'm going to do here is installing fing desktop now what is fing desktop it's an app that we can install on a machine so that we can have access to all the Wi-Fi data now click on login and we are going to create a new account on fing and after we create a new account on fing we are going to click here to download fing desktop and while this fing desktop is downloading we are going to talk about why we need fing and what exactly it is so as we already talked about it's a network monitoring solution and the top features of thinging comprises of these features number one it helps you get your device inventory which means that you have access to the list of devices that are connected to your network secondly gives you control over your network by letting you blocking the devices that you want so you have list of all the devices and if you want to block a particular device you can do that using thinging third thing is that you can track Network events like when was the outage it provides real-time notification on network events like outages new devices vulnerability and timeline for easy tracking you can limit anybody's internet connection you can detect hidden cameras you can track user activity you can use tools like Ping and DNS lookup to troubleshoot your networking issues and you can check your network speed and compar with the speed that your ISP promised you to give so talking about F's products there are primarily three products fing has number one is F's phone app which can be an IOS app or an Android app number two is fing desktop app which can be a desktop app and it is also available for Mac number three is an interesting one and it is fing agent for Rasberry Pi you can install fing on your Rasberry Pi and then you can use the local apis that thinging provides you can do pretty much everything that you can do on desktop and phone app by using fing on your Rasberry Pi we are going to see how to install fing on a Rasberry Pi very soon but before that let's explore fing app on our machine so fing has been downloaded on a computer now I'll open this app and I'll install thinging on my machine and I'm waiting for it to install and once it is installed I'm going to open it and let's proceed with the authentication it is asking me to authenticate let's click here and let's authenticate and boom I am inside my account now the moment I click on overview it has detected that I am inside my Rog strix g713 machine it is also detected that I'm using a tender router basically this is the name of my Wi-Fi network I can verify the speed I can test speed and it will check for network speed download speed as well as upload speed so my download speed is 91.6 and my upload speed is 92 93.1 or something amazing it it is also telling me about my ISP now these are the list of devices that are connected to my Wi-Fi network it has detected a router it has detected my laptop now these are some of the devices that I personally use and it is able to detect all these devices secondly I can always come to this security Tab and get an KN of how secure my network is it will show me all the warnings it will show me all the tests that passed and the test that needs attention now I can also use F's apis which are basically local apis by going to the URL but before that you'll have to click here you'll have to come to preferences and then you'll have to click on local API and you'll have to enable local apis as you can see fing is providing me the list of local API URLs I can always click here and once I click here you can see that it is showing me which device was connected when and whether it is currently connected or not so if it is currently connected the state will show as up otherwise the state will show as down you can see these are some of the devices which were previously connected but these are not connected as of now one of the devices being my Raspberry Pi now fing API allow developers and businesses to automate Network management the API provides access to device information event logs and network data we can use these Network apis like any other API and we can integrate it with a custom applications and use these apis like any other apis one of the best parts is that it also has an option to download the Open API specification so that we can get more information about our API and we can use all these apis effectively so it provides me two end points one is for seeing all the devices and the other for seeing all the people that are connected to the network now you can always set an API key to make your Fang API access secure and you can disallow some of the people that are on the same network and you don't want them to use the fing apis so we can always have an API key and you can pass your API key like this now obviously you can keep this API key more secure by making it longer but this is an example and in most of the cases you want your API key to be very small because you are the only person or you or somebody you trust are only the person that are using your API especially when you are on a home network now it is very easy to install thinging on your Rasberry P installing thing on a Raspberry Pi makes it very easy for us to access local apis plus Raspberry Pi is something which is always running so it helps us keep the fing app always alive now if you're looking for a guide on how to install fing agent on rber pie you can check out this guide which I'm going to link in the description this is the official guide that is going to teach you everything that you need to know about installing fing agent on your Raspberry Pi I am personally using this fing agent on my Raspberry Pi and it works like a charm now at the right side of my screen is the guide that is provided by fing and let me put the terminal at the left hand side and as you can see that I'm copying the commands that are present in this guide the first command is AP update and the second command is APD upgrade I'm going to give you the link of this guide so you can also follow along basically I'm simply following this guide and I'm copy pting the command the first command is AP install snapd I'm waiting for it to finish and then I'm going to copy Cudo snap install core and one by one I'll be running these commands I'm using OBS to record this screen on a Raspberry Pi so yeah it's little bit laggy in comparison to my regular videos but I think that should not be a problem I'm waiting for this command to finish and then I'll be pasting the next command we can use snap to install the fing agent which is why we are installing snap on a Raspberry Pi when I came across this guide I followed this and it pretty much worked so now I'm copy pasting this command to make sure that snapd is enabled and running I'm waiting for this command to finish and now the next step is to install the fing agent so let's copy this fing agent command and let's paste it and as you can see that snap is downloading fing agent and it will be installing it on my Raspberry Pi now why are we installing fing agent let us understand the very first thing that we are trying to do is installing fing agent on a Raspberry Pi and we are connecting our Raspberry Pi to our Wi-Fi now our fing app is running on the same same Wi-Fi our phone is connected to the same Wi-Fi which is why what happens is that this thinging agent can be directed by the fing app on our phone now once we configure this fing agent this fing agent can take over and it can basically start monitoring our Network and we will get realtime updates in all our devices even if they are off so our app will get all the updates even if you're not at home your app will get all the updates even if you turn off your laptops you can have all the monitoring data sent to you through the fing app because your fing agent is running your Raspberry Pi is running the fing agent which is taking care of all these things the fing agent takes care of monitoring the network and sending all the data to your phone once it is configured one of the things that I really liked about this sing agent is that it sends real time emails also you don't have to open the thinging app wherever you are if you have access to your emails you can get emails like this and you have all all the monitoring updates of your Wi-Fi at home or work so let's see how we can configure this fing agent now as you can see I'm inside of my phone screen and it says fing agent has been detected now I am the one who has installed this fing agent so I'll acknowledge it and now I'm going to click on this location button and it basically takes my address I'm going to click on home to make sure that this is marked correctly and then I'll click on done now as you can see it is showing me all my devices is it has detected all the devices that I have plus it has detected this Rasberry Pi where I've installed this ping agent now that we have understood fing apis it's time to build an app so I'm going to use this local API and I'm going to build an app with this local API as you can see I'm also opening chat gbt just in case and I'm creating a main.py which is going to be our flas cap but before that we'll have to install flask so let's pull up our terminal and I'm going to type pip install flask and flask will get installed make sure that you have python installed already and now I'm going to create a static folder and a templates folder so that I can create my static files and my template now let's start coding this app I'm going to import flask and I'm going to create a basic flas cap in order to create this flas cap and also I'm going to create a dashboard. HTML which will render a dashboard and as you can see that I've created a dashboard. HTML here so let's start coding a app I'm going to say from flask import flask and then we are going to import render template and jsonify so let's do that and also we are going to say app is equal to flask and we are going to say underscore uncore name and that is going to create our app now we are going to create some endpoint I'm going to create two endpoints here but before that we'll also import request and we we are going to Simply say request.get and we are going to put the URL here this is the local API make sure that this is local API and is not going to work on somebody else's device and let's say R is equal to request.get and after I say R is equal to request. get I can always do r. Json but I can always go to the documentation and verify this so you can always go to request documentation I'm sure it's r. Json but again you can go to the documentation and you can always verify r Json is going to give you the pared dictionary with all the data so say network data is equal to r. Json and we have all the network data here now what we are going to do is create two endpoints the first one is going to be a slash and this will be our main dashboard so let's say def dashboard we are creating a function and now we are going to return render template I'll return my dashboard template and I'll pass in the network data devices so say devices is equal to network data devices so there is a key called devices if you look at the API response we are using that data and I'm going to populate my dashboard. HTML using some basic HTML I have some tables here and we are using Ginger templating and I'll also populate style. CSS this is very basic table and CSS Styles now let's say app. run so that we can test our app and we'll do debug is equal to true so that the debug is on the flash cap has been started now we'll control click here and let's see if it works control click to open the app and wow it is showing me all the devices the network devices dashboard is here you can see the IP address the state the name of the router and device and you can also see that when was it first seen and when was it changed which is amazing and I am also adding another Endo here which is going to show me the devices and it is going to be an API it is going to be a Json resp response now the thing is you can always change this Json response I am putting the Json response as it is but the idea of this route is that you can always change the network data and you can always change the way thing is showing the apis through your flash cap so basically your flas cap is showing this Json data Let's test it out/ devices and you can see that we have created our custom API so if you want to show some additional fields or maybe you want to remove some Fields you can always do processing here and then you are going to get the results in/ API SL devices how cool is that so yeah that was all about this video if you want to access the apis and if you want to get more features from fing you can always upgrade to starter plan or Premium plan you can always sign up and use the free plan and you get up to three scans per day internet speed test and other features but if you are somebody who wants to get more control over your network you can always go to starter or Premier plan and you can get unlimited automated scans 7 Days of event timeline and automated Security checks you can also get hidden camera detector if this is something that you want all for just $24.99 per year which in my opinion is a great pricing if you are looking for network security you are just paying $25 a year and same goes for Premier if you are a business user and you want continuous monitoring and you want to use thing very aggressively you can always switch to Premium plan and that should get the job done for you so some of the real life use cases of fing are that it protects you from intrusions it helps you detect hidden cameras in public networks and rentals like lbnb it can also help you set internet downtime for your personal well-being and it can also help you trouble shoot your network issues with Smart Tools so I'll put the link to thinging in the description and you can check it out download it try the free plan for sure and if you like it you can always upgrade so I hope this video was helpful thank you so much guys for watching this video and I will see you next time,TRUE

coding while scraping the web whenever we scrape a website most our time is spent understanding the structure of that website we have to work hard to find the target element so that we can get the text that we need and then we have to work on consistency of the same selector in different pages most of our time while web scrapping is spent on this the rest of the things are relatively very easy in this video I'll show you how to leverage AI to scrape any website using oxyco we'll see step by step how all these things are done let's move on to our computer screen and let's get started so guys the first thing that I want to do here is sign up on oxy laabs and then we are going to explore the oxy laap co-pilot so as you can see I'm inside my computer screen and I'm going to write oxy laabs

to my account so I'm going to log in here and I'm going to all the cookies and then I'm going to start with Google Now this is actually huge because as a person who scrapes the web I understand how difficult of a task it is to scrape different websites which keeps on changing now if AI can get the job done that too accurately I don't think anything can be better than that so now I'll come here to web scripper API and I'm going to start the free trial let me read the terms and conditions and let's now click on start free trial now as you can see the free trial is activated which means we are ready to start scraping the web now it is asking me to create an API user so let me create an API user very quickly now we need this API user so that we can authenticate whenever we are using oxy laabs copilot so let me write Harry here and let me choose a strong password it is saying at least one uppercase character at least one lowercase characters okay so we need at least 12 character and also we can have underscore and I'm going to copy this and let's create our API user so my username is Harry and the password is the one that I've copied to my clipboard now it is asking me to test this setup by copy based this command in the terminal I'm going to fire git patch on my machine and then we are going to test this so let's go so let's copy this and let's paste this on G bash and as you can see the scraping has been started basically we have just tested this web scraping setup you can see this eo. third generation 16 million color something we are seeing all the products which means Amazon is getting script correctly awesome that's a good news now this is not how I want to use it I want to actually run it as a program and I want to be able to scale the setup so that I can scrape the web at scale so how do you use this in a program I'm going to show you in a bit but before that let's go to this scraper api's playground so that we can play around with this API now scraper API playground is loading now it even has code for python PHP C goang Java nodejs Json you can build the scraper and then you can copy paste the code from here which makes it very easy to use now I'm going to select Amazon here and let me open Amazon in Incognito tab so that it it is not biased and we start from a clean slate because I'm already logged into my Amazon account now let's understand the use case whenever there is a sale like flip cart's big billion day sale or Amazon's great Indian festival sale we want to actually find the laptops that we can buy and for that we go to the web we search for the laptops we short list but how about we have the data in the CSV if we can somehow get this data in CSV I think it's going to make the task a whole lot easier because we can simply look at that CSV and after looking at that CSV we can make a decision of buying a particular laptop so let's go to Amazon I'm going to select search in the scraper section and now it is asking me for a query so I'll enter search query which is laptops now there are some additional parameters like parsing do you want to parse the data do you want a parsel if you don't want the parsel you can get rid of this now I'm going to select in here because I'm in India and then location should be your PIN code and now if you leave your local as triple dot it means that you want your local to be detected autom automatically now this is the user agent which means how do you want your request to go do you want to make it as a desktop Chrome or phone Chrome or Firefox it's up to you you can actually control who your client is now there is an option of JavaScript rendering I'm going to enable it and let me explain what JavaScript rendering is whenever you go to a website it first loads the HTML and after that the JavaScript executes on that page which might change that page and might not change the page now if you enable JavaScript rendering your page will change because of that JavaScript and if you want to consider that change while scraping the web you can enable JavaScript rendering and if not you can disable the JavaScript rendering now there is no rule of thumb but you can try both of these methods when you are scraping a random website and whichever works you can adopt it now we can also give start page we can give the number of pages so it will take care of all the pages it will select all the pages and give me the data from all of these Pages basically you're scraping pages in bulk now there is something called category ID in Amazon which you can use this ID is the category ID the ID that you are seeing in the URL bar now you can copy this ID and you can paste this ID into your oxyb scraper and that is going to consider only the products from this category ID now you can also have merchant ID and you can get results only from a particular seller now these are some of the additional parameters that you can use with this scraper which makes this scraper really very custom now let's click on submit request I'm really very excited and let's see if this is able to scrape the results for me now it is asking me to change the pages to a positive integer my bad let me change this to a positive integer one and two now this is going to take some time and that doesn't matter let me tell you why that doesn't matter whenever we are scraping a website we usually do it as a Cron job on a server now we're using cron jobs on a server we don't care how much time it takes because most of the time it is a nightly job now if you do parsing false you're going to get the HTML now I'll enable this parsing as true so that I get only the passed content but in that case you are going to see the HTML now you might be thinking why would we we need the entire HTML and we would need the entire HTML because at times we want to save the HTML page so that we can scrape more parameters from the page later so let us say you are extracting prize title and reviews and later you thought I also want to extract how many were bought last month you can always do that because you have the raw HTML now the most impressive thing here is that it has given me all the results it has given me the URL it has given me the Asin Asin is basically the unique code for a given product on Amazon it has given me sales volume it is given me currency is prime or not which means that I can analyze this data even if I'm an Amazon Seller as a seller I can analyze this data and I can draw insights on which products to keep in inventory which products to sell because this is giving me sale estimate also now this was just one website oxy apps give you a lot of different options to scrape other website like Bing Google and other e-commerce websites now you can extract any other website using AI as well you just give the prompt and oxy copilot do the rest of the things now let me show you this app parsing instructions feature you can build your own parer using AI now there are four methods to build a paror either you can create using AI or you can use your template import your code or you can start from scratch now I'm going to create with AI because this is going to be the simplest way to create the passer so let's click on create using Ai and I'm going to go to the Amazon search page I'm going to write laptops let me enter the search page URL here now I want to give a prompt so I'll say I want to extract name price and star readings so I need a very simple parser and I'm going to enable JavaScript rendering because I want JavaScript to be executed whenever my page loads let's click on generate instructions and this is going to take some time it is basically generating the parser now as you can see it has generated the parsing instructions for me it basically generates a parsing schema which is capable of extracting this data out you can see we have name price tar readings amazing now these are the passing instructions which contains the data to get that pass data these instructions are basically X paath and Rex which oyap will use to get the pass data so let's save the instructions and now let's click on submit request and you can see that I have all the results in the same format as I've specified in the custom parser which is amazing we needed only the name star readings and price and we got those some of the fields are automatically added by oxyb scop Pilot like created at updated at which is fine and it also adds The Source URL which makes a lot of sense now let's explore this oxy copilot which is build your scraper with AI nice let's try this out so I'll put the URL to scrape and I'll also put the requirements let me go flip cart's website and let me grab a product from there let me search for iPhone 15 Pro Max let's copy the URL and let's take this URL and past it here and I'll say I want to scrape price title ratings and reviews and let's click on generate scraper now it is asking me to add the parsing instructions I'll continue without passing We'll add this later so I'll delete the previous parser and I'm going to build my own parser so let me click on create with AI I'll replace the Amazon URL with Flipkart URL and I'm going to change this prompt and I'll say I want to extract try title prize and star ratings let's click on generate instructions the JavaScript rendering is true and it is generating so let's wait for it to generate and as you can see it has successfully fetched the pricee title ratings amazing so let's save the instructions and let's submit the request and usually it was not giving me the correct results and after some time I realized that disabling the JavaScript rendering did the task for me so I disabled the JavaScript rendering and now I'm getting the output it is giving me all the information from the page so I hope that you were able to understand understand how to scrape the web using Ai and I hope that you like this oxyco pilot AI I'll put all the relevant information in the description of this video and in the pin comments so go ahead sign up to oxylabs try this out and start free trial it's absolutely free and definitely

TSX if you're using typescript now if you don't know what is page. TSX this is the entry point now the next GSA router is based on file based routing which means that your app folder will have all the routes now the page. TSX file will ser slash route if you create a folder inside app let us say if we create a folder called about SL page. TSX now page. TSX will be responsible to serve slash about endpoint okay now we are going to go to extensions and we are going to install an extension called es6 react Redux Snippets so es6 react es7 I I think it's called react react native es7 stets and I guess I have already installed this so I don't have to but I want to show you that this extension will be used it's called es7 plus react Redux react native Snippets make sure you install this by dsz nasar and I'll tell you why you have to install it once you install it you can type ra fce and this will create a react functional component okay so we can simply call this a about and the moment you type RFC you can type about and this changes the content and the export default the name of the component about so all you have to do is rafc and type about and you are good to go now if I go to slash about I'll show you that we have this about but we don't want to keep a page this simple we want to create a blog that looks like the one we saw during the demo so let's go to our vs code and let's install shat CN UI now what is shat CN UI okay so it's not a component library but it's I'll show you it is not a component Library if you go to docs it tells this is not a component Library it's a collection of reusable components how do you install it simply install it using pnpm you can go to installation then since we are using nextjs I'm going to click on nextjs and we have already created our nextjs app so we'll copy this command the moment you press this copy button you are shown some options are you using npm or Yan or pnpm simply copy the pnpm paste it press enter and yes we have installed Shad CN UI so it will ask you few questions it is asking you which style would you like to use I'm going to go with default you can try New York as well later it simply makes your component look little bit different but let's go for default and I'm going to go for slate and I'm going to keep this really simple would you like to use CSS variables for colors yes and let's wait for it to install it will install in few seconds so success yes it has installed and shat CN has been installed now we'll have to install all these components individually let me showcase shat CN to you very quickly if you go to components we have accordion we have alert we have alert dialogue if you go to accordion you can get this by copy pasting this component I'll show you how you can get this but let's see what it can provide you can get this alert component which looks something like this you can get the alert dialogue which looks something like this it really looks cool and then you can get an avatar you can get a spec ratio I'll tell you why it is useful and then you can get a badge like this you can get breadcrumbs like this and then you can use buttons and now buttons is really simple but again it helps you create different types of buttons we'll we we'll see why we should use sharp CN buttons and then calendar looks something like this then we have card which looks something like this and then we have carousal which looks something like this now you can always create these carousal using Tailwind CSS using JavaScript I know you can do it you know you can do it but the thing is chart CN saves a lot of time now charts is something new you can use chart and you can have different sort of charts and if you use default the chart is going to look something like this and if you use New York the chart is going to look something like this okay it's matter of choice you can always customize it and yeah accept terms and conditions this is checkbox then we have collapsible now collapsible looks something like this and then you have combo box you have a lot of components you have a resizable component which is really difficult to create at least time taking to create if not difficult and then we have a switch we have a toast like sonor if you click here something like this pops up we have text area and why text area text area is there in HTML right no text area is there in HTML but it doesn't look something like this this text area is cooler than the one that we get in HTML and then you have the tole you have the tole group then tool tip toast toast looks something like this then we have toggle toggle looks something like this let us say you want to enable dark mode it will highlight it something like this and then if you click it again it will remove the highlight and then toggle group it looks something like this you can toggle different sort of things if you want to uh create a Wiig editor this is this is an example from a viig editor if you don't know what Vis editor is let's not discuss much about it's not the topic of this video then we have this tool tip the moment you hover it's going to show you some text all these components can be used very conveniently just by installing it and the best part is you don't have to install all the components at once you can install the ones that you really want to use this is the the best part about chaten because it keeps your application lightweight now let's get back to vs code and let's start creating our Blog Page let's let's start by creating a Blog Page how do we create a blog page we can go to app and we can say blog and then we can say/ page. TSX okay this is a Blog Page and then we can have a blog post page which will be blogpost slash and then slug do TSX now you might be wondering what exactly is this slug dtsx in fact I should create a slug folder and then inside the slug folder there should be page. TSX so let me fix this real quick page. TSX and then there should be a slug folder and then inside the slug folder there should be this page. TSX let me move it inside the slug folder I think I created a file called slug my bad let me remove this so inside my blog post I want to create a folder called Slug and then inside this slug folder I want to move this page. TSX okay so we have this about folder and then inside the app we should have this blog post folder all right so this is how the app looks now we have this app folder then we have about then we have a Blog folder and then we have a blog post folder inside which we have a slug folder and then page. TSX why do we have this slug folder because we want to use something called Dynamic routes in xjs and I'll show you how it works so let's go to our about page and you can see that we have our page. TSX right here and we can write our about page very easily but before that I want to show you how we can create a block page so let's get started by writing our blog page because that is the simplest thing that we can do after installing chat CN now I want to use buttons from chat CN now since I've installed chat CN I want to show you something now if you go to your global. CSS it has actually added some CSS here and then it also has Tailwind which you can see from Tailwind doc config.txt it to our root layout now we have a layout. TSX here let's paste it and also I'm going to very blindly copy this and paste this why why am I saying blindly because I don't want to focus much on fonts at this point I'm going to follow what chat c and documentation is saying and then let's copy this body tag also and I'll I'll explain you what the CN is let me copy this first and this is the body tag and CN should be imported Quick Fix add import from lails and yes it works you can also type this out if the option doesn't show up but it should okay let's get back and let's see is there anything else that we need to do no we don't so we need to import font family in our Tailwind Doc conf.js in our case this is TS because we are using typescript and if you don't know typescript do not worry I'm going to show you everything just follow along and you'll learn everything so import font family from Tailwind CSS slash Tailwind CSS SL default theme if I'm not wrong yes Tailwind CSS SL default theme yes now this is required but I'm using common JS okay so sorry I'm using modules this is common JS so let's now copy this and add it to extend so you see this extend here you need to paste it to your extend now this part might seem little boring but you have to do it and all I'm doing is following the documentation and trust me I'm going to explain you what the CN is about but after some time after some time I'm going to explain you what the CN is so let's move and let's start building a page UI okay now I'm going to create a folder called components where I will add my components now this is already created if you are using nextjs 14 or 15 now I'm going to click on this plus icon and I'm going to say Max with rapper. TSX okay this is a component now this component will help out by creating a Max width wrapper around your application so sometimes what happens is you have to create a Max width wrapper around your components and it gets really difficult uh because you have to add that Max width wrapper to each and every component I'm going to import CN and I'm going to explain what this CN is in a while let's say add class name to this Dev the first class name is MX Auto MX now what is MX Auto MX Auto and Max width screen Excel Max width and MX Auto are used to Center something so if I have something written here it will be centered to the screen and also I want to use width full so that this gets a full width and then margin y of 12 I want some margin at the top of my components uh all the components wherever I wrap this Max withth I'm typing my13 because I need a margin y of 12 and then we'll have an input class name that we will receive as props to this component okay now we have class name here and then we'll have children here because this is a wrapper children and since we are using typescript we'll have to create an interface and let's create an interface called Max withd props interface Max withd props so we have class name which is a string and then we have children which is nothing but react. react node react node yes so we have this interface and now the error is gone so all we are doing is we are saying that hey wrap anything that this Max width wrapper gets inside a div children okay now I'm putting children in here and as you can see this will wrap this children okay now I'll show you why we did this and let me show you what this CN is now CN is a function that will allow you to merge two different classes entailment CSS now let me first tell you that why we need the CN function this is a function that shaten gives us now let's say you have a class MX Auto M Max W screen XEL and W full now let us say you want to add another class which is called my class and you want this my class to override all the CSS properties that are coming from these individual classes do you think this will work no this will not work because we don't know in what order this CSS is going to generate this is done by Tailwind CSS so in order to merge two classes such that the later class gets the priority we need to use the CN function now some people still have this this misconception that if you add a class after something let us say if I say flex and then I say block now some people think that the display of this div is block but no we don't know whether it's Flex or block if you want it to be block if you want that if a block is added after Flex it should take preference you need to use CN function so in order to make this work we will use CN and since we are using JavaScript we'll have to W it in curly brackets and let's do this and also let's merge okay so let us say I want to merge this with another class I can add that another class here okay now what is that another class obviously that another class is class name this is getting an input now why am I typing class name here so this Max withth rapper is actually a rapper which will get class names you should be able to add class name to this component and whenever you add any class to this component that class should take the priority and in order to give priority to that class you need to use CN function and you need to put this class name as the second parameter of CN function so this div will have these classes but if I give another class through props those classes should get the priority I hope that is clear okay if it's not please please watch this part of the video again now let's come back to page. TSX not this one but this one the homepage. TSX which has all the next year's things inside so if you go to the homepage of this app you will get you'll get this 3,000 my bad Local Host 3,000 I think the app is not running I'll have to run the app what is it pnpm run Dev this was not running I think I restarted my terminal but that should be fine it should work now local 3,000 this works and yeah this page is not looking very good because we have added CSS from Shad CN and we are going to fix this in a while so let's do one thing let's come back to this main tag let's remove this main tag and let's re this main tag again and we are going to add a nav bar to the entire app so how do you do that you do that using layout. TSX and also I don't want the title of this to be create next app I want it to be programming with Harry and also I'm I want the description to be the description of programming with Harry now there is a good practice here and the good practice says that you should have a config folder where you should be able to configure your variables okay so how do we add a config folder you can add a config folder by simply creating that config folder and we can configure things using this config folder so config slite dots okay let's let's say export default and let's export a export an object so I'll say title and let me cut this and call this config site config and let's say const site config is equal to title programming with Harry and the thing is that you can import this from site dots so where is my layout I just closed it so you don't have to type it out because in future you can change it so site config let me import site config do title okay so the sign config has been imported and then we have siteconfig do title and then we'll have site config do description description and let's add description here so description oops and programming with Harry is a Blog for your programming doubts we'll we'll generate it using chart gbt so the thing is that you can generate it using chart gbt also if you have your site config at one place and you don't want want to type boring things you can always generate it using chart GPD okay let's go back to a page and let's see how it looks so we have the title set we should have the description set if you go to right click view page Source we should have the description set so if you go to programming we have the description we have the meta description set this is very important for SEO guys okay now let's add a navbar component so I'll come to components and I'll create a file called navbar navb bar. TSX ra fce and then press enter let's create a Navar so let's return nav and I'm going to create a nav bar here and nav will have a class of flex class name is equal to flex display flex and then we have a UL inside this and then we have Ali inside of this and lii will have some links and Link will come from next link so we say import link from import link from next link and then we have link HF href is equal to slash and then inside this I'll say home and then we'll say about we'll say about so Li link about and then HF will be about HF is equal to slash about and let's see how it looks it should not look very good but it should not look very bad either we don't have used the Navar component yet so let's go to layout. TSX let's close to to the right and also let's close this global. CSS and s. I'll add the nav bar right after body above the children so let's add the nav bar here so let's let's say Navar and it's automatically imported as you can see it is automatically imported which is why I don't see any errors so this is how my website is looking at this point home about we have the links but it looks very ugly so let's make it better by using by by going to this nav bar and let's add a div here so let's add a div here and we'll say programming with Harry what I'm trying to do is I'm going to create a logo and then I'm going to create a navigation bar at the right of the logo okay so how do we fix it we can use Shard CN UI actually and we also want to make the snap bar sticky so we can use Shard CN UI for the buttons that I'm going to add but in order to make it sticky I'm give it I'm going to give it some height and let's say h16 and let's say BG red and you'll say why BG red Harry this looks really ugly wait a minute I just want to see how it looks and then I'm going to change the color of this to something else okay so do not worry at all I'm going to add some Bott so first let me make it sticky and then top zero this will actually help me get it at the top when I scroll it really helps when you want your NV bars to stick to the top and then border B border B will add this CSS which is border bottom width one pixel it will add a very good looking border and then let's say BG background now what is BG background and let's say 60 now BG background 60 will actually give it an opacity of 0.6 and it will add minus minus background color as background now what is this minus minus background color we got it from chat c and if you look at global. CSS you'll see that this background is this color this hsl so if you want to convert it to RGB or rgba you can do that you can go to Google and learn about hsl uh it's called Hue saturation and L is for lightness if I'm not wrong yes L is for lightness please confirm this in the comment guys it it is for lightness I guess yeah let's come back to a navb bar. TSX and let's start start building on Navar so we have this border B and we have added a BG background 60 which gives it a very good look I want px8 so that it has padding uh in X and then backdrop blur backdrop blur let's add backdrop blur backdrop blur will simply add this blur effect which really looks cool so if I show you my now it looks something like this but again in the dark mode this is going to look really good and if there is some content behind it this backdrop blur really looks good in order to demonstrate this I want to open the page do DSX and let me add some text I think I've added a lot of text I should not be creating such huge files but if you look at this this is creating a blur effect as you can see this looks like a glass and it really looks good so let me remove this I've created a huge file I shouldn't have done that 435 and I think this should give me enough No it didn't 4350 should give me enough scroll yes yeah okay so we have this website we are going to change the content of this website do not worry let me finish the Navar first so let me come back to Navar and I want this programming with Harry to look bold so class name is equal to font bold and then text Excel I want it to look little larger and then we want to give display Flex to a navbar as well so let's give it a display flex and after giving it display Flex it looks something like this and let me inspect this and let me see how it looks at this point so we have this SV bar the width of this SV bar is full then we have this div then we have this UL let me give Flex boox to this UL also so if I say class name is equal to flex and if I say width full width full and let me also add a color to this so we have this UL taking this much of space and then we have this div taking some space now if I add justify content space around a space between it doesn't work because I should be using align items okay so I should say align item Center let me align these items to Center so align item Center item Center and then we are going to add justify between to this one because I want this to go away from this now since I want this home to be at the end so let me justify this to end justify n should work well here and yeah it does so we have this nav bar and also I want some space so I'll say Space X space x 4 maybe and the space X4 will give the space between all these okay this looks fine this looks fine let me also add a button so I'll say lii do buttons and I'm going to add buttons from shat CN now how do we add buttons from shat CN you might ask you can go to Shar CN UI go to button and copy this this code because you want to add a button so pnpm since we are using pnpm you can use npm as well I don't have any problem but pnpm is going to be much faster than npm so please use pnpm all you need to add is this extra p and npm I minus G pnpm obviously let's copy this button and let's use this button so I'll simply go back to my page. navb bar. TSX and let me add a button here so in order to add a button you have two options one is you can either add this as a button or you can also add as a link like this so if you want to add it as a link like this all you need to do is this and let's import button variants and also let's import I'll go to Quick Fix Quick Fix Quick Fix okay so it says HF is missing so HF is equal to slash login so let us say we have a login page and we have a signup page login and then we have let us say a sign up page sign up sign up okay we have two buttons here let's see how our website looks now it looks something like this so these buttons are not aligned so we need to align this vertically so in order to align this vertically we'll say item Center item Center so item Center will align it vertically and let's add some space so to this Li I'm going to add space x 4 maybe let's see how it looks it's up to you it's up to you you can you can either add space X2 two or you can add space X4 until unless it looks good and I might also add space X6 here and it looks something like this so it's your choice if you want some padding you can add the padding as well so if you want the padding if you say PX 5 maybe PX 4 4 maybe PX4 will work and space X2 I'll have to add some space X2 also and yeah it looks fine I think it looks fine now I also want to be able to add a button to toggle dark mode or light mode now in shat CN you can actually use dark mode and light mode they have the entire page dedicated to this so if you go to nextjs if you click on dark mode here and if you go to nextjs and if you create a theme provider so first you need to install this package called Next themes let's take this step by step we are going to add Dark theme and light theme now so let's take this step by step I've added this next teams package it is installing it has installed now I'll create a theme provider. TSX file and paste this inside of this okay so theme provider. TSX let's create this theme provider. TSX let me go to components and let me say theme providers. DSX and let's paste the content as is and you don't have to understand how it works I'm going to explain how it works but for now you don't have to let's get this working first and then inside a layout. TSX you need to copy this layout. TSX where is my layout. TSX it's here okay I'm going to copy this and components theme provider theme provider is declared but its value is never read okay we are going to use it so we want our body to get access to the theme provider so let's copy this and do do not worry I'm going to explain you everything I am going to explain you everything a navbar should have access to theme provider control X so whatever you wrap inside this theme provider will have access to the default theme so default theme Here is system if you make it dark it will be dark mode okay so if I make it dark my website will go on dark mode now it's giving me some errors which I'm eventually going to solve but let me see what the error is it says fail to compile module not found theme provider let's check what the issue is so it says that cannot find module theme provider or its theme provider okay so I actually named it as theme providers I should call it theme provider it should work now should work now so it is still showing me red line and I'll show you how to fix it so if you uh go to control shift V if you open your command pallet and you type restart Tye TS server and if you restart your TS server this error will go sometimes your error doesn't go away so if you want it to go away and if you are sure that you have done everything right and still you are seeing that red line you can always right click go to command pallet and search for restart type TS server and simply run it and it will work so let's refresh and it's still not working it says that you forgot to add Min CSS extract plugin and I think I need to restart my app let me restart my app this happens sometimes so let's restart the app and after I restart the app I hope it works it's compiling and yes it works and you can see that we have dark mode and it's looking really good and if you don't like this glass glass effect you can always tweak this opacity variable which is 60 at this point if you want to make it 40 if you want to play around with this variable you can do that so 40 40 also looks good so let's keep it 40 or maybe in between 40 and 60 let me keep it 50 but it's up to you it's up to you now I want the ability to change this theme to light or dark at this moment I can do this manually by going to layout. TSX I can do this manually by changing this default theme to light okay now if I change this to light and if I refresh it should have changed to light but not sure why it is not light control shift R doesn't work default theme light let's restart maybe restarting will work restarting and reloading the page makes it light but I want the ability to make it light and dark by clicking this button so let's import these two buttons first and then we'll see how we can toggle the themes but let's go to this page and this page has this this button and if you switch to dark or light you can always change to light and dark let's copy this button as is I really like this so let's import these buttons first and then also import use theme and I'll also have to make my component a client component which is Navar so let me make the Navar as client component because I'm not anyway doing any server side stuff so let's make this component as client component use client let's import the icons and then it says that you have not use it we will use it don't worry let's import this button I think we have already imported the button let's let's copy this and let's copy the mode toggle also and I think if I do this this should but I think a better approach would be to copy this and create a separate component out of it so let's do that instead of making this a client component let me create a separate component called theme toggle theme toggle. TSX and I don't want to repeat the mistake and let's paste this so I have actually copied this and after copying this I've pasted this and I think I have not installed the dropdown so we'll have to install the drop down let's go to drop down and le",TRUE

chance to meet Manish who is director uh of Deep Mind India and I got a chance to ask him some questions and chat around so firstly Manish thank you so much for your time here uh because I know you have been very busy today and you still spared some time so first of all thank you for that thank you for having me thank you so much thank you so much so yeah so Manish I have some questions around AI which my audience would be very interested and especially I am also very interested in some of the answers and uh if they comes from a person like you I think we all will be enlightened so let's uh start with my first question which is what do you think how will AI change the way people work and specifically the developers work in the next 10 years how will it change yeah so I think will change everything uh uh I mean you can start with some very simple thing right so already today when you're let's say doing any coding you can see already there are AI based assistants right that can atically speed up your productivity right they can help you they can come up with suggestions you just need to describe at a high level and yeah I will suggeste code for you it can help you debug problems I mean we announced this 2 million uh context token context window which allows you to throw so much of code right at the Gemini model and it will help you yeah identify various problems with it but to me that is only like a like a super official way because AI I think just the kind of problems that you previously would have thought of as science fiction is going to enable that kind of a functionality so so the kind of problems that previously developers might not have even dared try and solve I think they will be able to attack those kind of problems so I think that will be the more profound change for developers amazing so tackle problem that you previously didn't even think okay would have been possible to solve yeah I mean who thought of flying in aeroplanes long back when early Humanity stage yeah yeah you are right so yeah thank you uh yeah so next question um is around uh can you share some successful case studies where AI has made a significant impact and specifically to light on some of the case studies where you think that this particular industry can be revolutionized with AI U tell us about some of your experiences there yeah so so I would say like already we have seen like things like Google Search right that people use and so on they have been powered by AI uh and and over the years right we have kind of really made it very easy for people to find answers and so on but I think what is coming is going to be completely at a different level correct uh so I'm personally very very excited about how AI is going to transform things like learning okay how we all learn yeah how it's going to transform Healthcare uh again which is again very relevant for India as a country we have such a severe shortage of trained doctors in any field uh and and I believe again AI is going to lead the way in terms of healthare becoming much more proactive much more consumer-driven where through AI based kind of nudges and so on right we all are nud to leave lead healthier lives and we get early signs of warning right about risk factors that we may be at and and and get early warning right to go and consult a doctor so I think it is pretty much going to impact uh our team has been doing a lot of work also in agriculture which has been a relatively untouched area correct but by analyzing satellite imagery right and building AI models we're able to solve some of the more foundational problems in agriculture like identifying field boundaries identify what is being grown and so on because through those you can start to build foundational layers to build Solutions like how do you provide access to loan for Farmers correct reasonably priced crop insurance as well as do the subsidy all of the subsidy programs and advisory to Farmers right in a much more precise ma correct correct amazing yeah uh so uh my another question is around uh your advice for buding software developers in this AI era specifically the ones who don't have a lot of initial resources what is your advice to all those developers yeah so my first and foremost advice would be uh uh take care of your fundamentals because AI is ultimately a lot of it is based on math okay uh so some of those fundamentals about linear algebra probability statistics optimization right it's good to to uh educate yourself right on some of the basics because then that model that you're using fails sometimes you have to go back to the basics right to be able to really solve the problem the other advice I would say is uh a don't be overwhelmed by technology but at the same time commit to lifelong learning okay none of us kind of the technology is evolving at such a fast pace that none of us can say oh I've learned enough I've picked up enough skills and now I'm all said for life you have to keep learning and exploring right throughout your life so I would say focus on the fundamentals and commit to lifelong learning as the primary advice I would say yeah amazing I think the fundamentals one I also totally strong very strongly agree with that because I didn't initially started with the fundamentals and the moment I switch back to fundamentals when you start with that the two node neural network you start you know understanding what all these llms and Transformers are about how these models are working so yeah great advice uh my next question is around uh the recent Gemma 2 variant which has exceptionally beat the other open- source counterparts my question about that model would be that model really crushed all the open source the other models what do you think made it happen is it the data that Google has is it the technique or is it something else I would like to know more first of all I mean I I think of all of us Google other companies and so on really developing is ultimately very healthy for the ecosystem so I do not like to think in terms of crushing somebody I think it's it's nice to have that healthy competition it's wonderful to see so many different companies developing these open models so so we are investing a lot right in various kinds of techniques right different kinds of innovative architectures right which are able to take advantage of whatever the data that we have right and really solve these problems in a fundamentally more scalable manner so there's a lot of work that we are doing on that right including there's been a lot of work both at Google and Elsewhere on things like mixture of experts right how do you exploit sparity in these methods and so on uh so so one is a lot of architectural work right on how do you build uh and then of course uh there's a lot of work happening in terms of after you do the pre-training of these models how do you do better like uh supervised fine tuning of these uh methods and then all of the rlf right the human feedback that you get and kind of you you uh get these uh models to become more aligned right with human values with with kind of human preferences and so on and do the right thing right for the human users so so it's a very very exciting uh field and now we see all of these like agentic capabilities being developed right on top of these llms which is again a very very exciting area so so really looking forward to the Entre like research Community right continuing to advance the Frontiers and and hopefully all of our users all of our developers and users ultimately benefiting benefited yeah a lot is Yet to Come obviously so yeah so uh my last question is around Vex AI so we know about Vortex Ai and we know how it is revolutionizing the way people build apps even people who never thought that they will learn coding are building apps using Vortex AI using the models switching different models and doing training and testing how do you think would it impact the developer industry because if everybody can make models using Vex then eventually um the the work the kind of work that developers were was were doing is shifted towards all these uh professionals I I would say what your take on that yeah yeah so I would say a I mean the developers have a very key key role to play in even picking the right problems right in a lot of these problems understanding the domain and understanding even which are the right problems to solve that's a very important correct decision right that you have to make and there's a lot of intellectual in some sense uh uh uh uh input right that goes into uh determining that so so I think right from like and and as I said as these AI models become more powerful I think the sky is the limit right in terms of the kind of problems that you can you can Sol so I think we should in some sense uh not think of it as AI versus human but really think of AI plus human correct how do we use these AI models right to augment the human capability and help us tackle much tougher problems and and in a far more productive Manner and with with much lower cost right for development correct correct yeah nice uh thank you so much for all the insights I mean it's great catching of with you especially at this event and thank you so much for your time and yeah thanks a lot yeah,TRUE

website using WordPress this video is going to demonstrate the power of Wordpress when it comes to building a travel website we'll see how we can plan trips I'm going to show you how exactly you can create a WordPress travel website within a few clicks that's correct the website will be developed within a few clicks and then we are going to customize it by going to the WordPress dashboard it's going to be fun I'm really excited let's move on to our computer screen and let's get started all right so for this tutorial I'm going to be using local which is a tool for spawning WordPress websites locally if you don't know what is local it's actually called local WP you can install it for free and you can start by opening it and clicking on plus icon then you can create a new website and then I'm going to name it travel uh let's call it Harry travels Harry travels let's click continue preferred continue and I'm going to use a very weak password which is admin and admin just because this is by computer if you are using a serious hosting a website which is very serious and it's close to your heart and close to your business you should not use this uh username and password combination because it's very insecure uh anyways let's wait for it to finish it's basically spawning a WordPress website for me and in the meantime I'm going to show you the plugin that I'm going to use and the plugin is called WP travel engine yes this is the travel engine plug-in that we are going to use so so there are two versions of this plugin the first one is free for everyone to use and the second one is a paid plugin that we are going to talk about so let's start by creating a website using the free version of the plug-in but before that I want to make sure that my WordPress website is up and running uh local is still installing WordPress and it's done so let's click on WP admin the username is admin the password is admin yes I want it to remember me let's click on login and let's save this password and as you can see see that there is no plug-in installed uh as of now so let me click on add new plugin and I'm going to search for WP travel and it is going to show me the wp travel engine plug-in and I'm going to install it then I'm going to activate it and then I'm going to refresh this page so three steps let's do all the three steps one by one installing the plug-in the plug-in is installed let's activate the plugin the plugin is activated and now let's refresh the page and it's showing me a popup Let's uh work on this popup welcome to WP travel engine get started I want to make sure that the base currency is US Dollars the currency symbol is dollar I like dollar I don't like this USD but in case you like USD you can go ahead and choose USD then what it should be a thousand separator let's use comma and I'm going to click continue and no I don't want to disable admin notification my sales email uh notification is going to be be har at COD withh har.com you can use any email this is going to be uh the email where you are going to receive the notifications okay and your from email should also be the same in the idle scenario but let's click continue here the checkout page should be called checkout terms and conditions terms and condition thank you page should be this I want to make sure that all of these are default let's click on continue you can either use the PayPal payment Gateway or you can simply use this book now pay later I'm going to use this book now pay later so that people can book now and they can pay whenever they want uh I mean during the uh trip they can they can book before the trip or during the trip somehow so it's just like cash on delivery in e-commerce if that makes sense let's click continue and it's asking me to create my first trip so this is a travel booking website so I should create a trip in order to make sure that customers are able to purchase the trip so let's click on uh click here now it's introducing me to the WordPress block editor let's click next next next get started and this is going to be my trip code let me add the title of the trip let's call it rishikes trip and I'm going to or maybe let's call it San Francisco trip San Francisco trip so let us say I'm selling trips to San Francisco and I'm going to show you around the Google office the Microsoft Office H Etc okay let's let's write something about San Francisco trip I am going to show you around downtown San Francisco and we are going to go to the Silicon Valley Silicon Valley to the Google Facebook LinkedIn Linkin and Oracle office Oracle office Oracle office is Amazing by the way let's focus on this strip so let's uh make sure that all of these settings are filled we are going to start with General so it's basically filling the trip code by default it's asking me for duration let's make it 10 days and let's say 10 nights enable cut of time cut of time is from when onwards then people start booking this strip so I'm going to make sure that this is not enabled uh set minimum and maximum age going enable minimum and maximum age required restriction for this booking this trip let's not do it I I'm going to pick up a date and time I'll add a package and the first package is Tech offices and I'm going to click on edit pricing and let's label it as adult price is say 500 or say $50 per person let's make it $500 actually it makes more sense and let's save and close and let's add another package we are going to say downtown and downtown is $500 as well for adults okay and then let's save and close let's go to overview now we can have the section title as overview and let's call it I am going to show you around San Francisco and you you can also add trip highlights Tech offices Google Facebook Silicon Valley visit save and continue includes excludes so includes SL exclude section title let's let's call it food and accommodation cost includes title should be your food let's add list of Services food good living and miscellaneous expenses and let's make sure that the spellings are correct and cost excludes let's not add what cost excludes now you can add some pictures you can also add a map you can add a map image or you can add map iframe code so I'll say San Francisco and let's open it in Google maps and after I open it in Google Maps I want to make sure that I I add the iframe code of this area so let's do one thing um let's zoom into Union Square and let's let me go to the place where I have went because I know that place let me add a pin here and I am going to share this and I'm going to copy the iframe code embed a map and this is the iframe code and I can paste the iframe code here save and continue and you can add frequently asked questions uh is smoking during the trip allowed that's a very weird question but FAQ so let's say trip faq's no it's not please don't even think about it and let's click save and continue extra Services let's not add the extra Services extension for now and I'm going to publish this trip we can view the trip but before I view the trip you'll say that hey this website is not looking good what's going on what's up with this website now there is a problem with this website and the problem is that this website is not looking good and the reason that it is not looking good is that it is not using a better theme it's using 2024 theme which is not correctly I would say crafted for this plugin so let's do one thing if you go to your dashboard you will get this message which says you are just one step away complete WP speed travel engine activation now so let's click on this allow and continue and this is going to show me all the themes that I can activate now there are paid themes and there are free themes as well if you are serious about this website and you are making some money out of this website I would strongly recommend you buy a pro theme because it is very beautifully crafted it is going to make your website look really professional but for this tutorial I'm going to use a free theme so let's click on view themes let's click on get it now and after you enter your email address first name last name and download now it's going to send this theme to your email okay so once you do this you are going to get the theme I have already got mine so I'll go back to themes and I'll go to appearance and then themes and then add new theme and then I'm going to upload theme and then click on the choose theme button but and choose this theme so I have chosen this file and now I'll click install now this is the file which I received in my email for free after giving my name email and all those details let's activate this Theme by clicking activate and once you activate this theme you should see your website totally changed yes that's correct once you reload your website it's going to look like this amazing this is looking really great you can always change all these things you can go go ahead and start adding more trips you can click on view all to you can even change the footer now it's up to you and it's up to how you want to customize this you can change all these details you can uh start editing your pages you can start editing what you accept and the copyright message Etc I'm going to do one thing I'm going to add some more trips so let's do one thing let's go to the plugin WP travel engine and let's start creating a trip once again so I'll click on create a trip create a trip and let's call it Russia trip okay and let's add a package Russia package and for adult let me charge $1,000 per person save and close uh now let's publish it as is you can add more details obviously if you want to now if I reload my website I'm going to see this strip here you can always add the image and I strongly advise you to add an image because it is going to make your website look professional but as you can see that this is the T itary if you go to San Francisco trip I have added the it so day one what you are doing day two what you are doing cost includes what cost excludes what the map is visible this is the map that we um added by using the iframe code frequently Asked question questions are here now you can always go and edit this and I'll show you how to edit this if you go to your WordPress dashboard you can go to trips and you can start editing all these trips so if you go to edit the San Francisco trip you can always change all these parameters so if you realize that there was something that you missed while creating a trip you can always go back to the trip page and you can always change that for example I want to add the tour itary properly which I did not add it previously so day one we are going to go to Google office let us say Google office we will visit Google office and then let's add another dat Facebook office we will visit the FB office and meet Mark okay let's save and continue let's update and if I refresh this you'll see that the to itary is here so day one is Google office D to his Facebook office and you can add you can add even more and then you can always accept this form content into your email all right so let us say that you want to book this Russia trip so let's click on this Russia trip and I'm going to simp simply check availability and let's continue and let's add this to the card and let's proceed to check out I'll say Harry and then I'll say Harry at code with harry.com and then I'll fill in my details and I'll simply choose book now pay later and I'll click book now and I will be getting the booking here as you can see that

them a call and you can say that hey you booked a trip should we confirm this this that other okay so this is how you do it you can send them an email and uh that that's how it works basically now this website gives me this message that this theme recommends the following plugins so it's always recommended to install these plugins and now we can uh install all these plugins so I'll say uh install I'll select all the plugins and I'll install the plugins and all the plugins will be installed and then activated so let's wait for it it's installing the plugins one by one I'm waiting for

Gradle file I'll come back to Gradle scripts build. Gradle file for the module app and I'll put this as a last implementation let's see what else we need to do uh let's sync now let's run the gradal sync which is going to take some time and yeah in some cases it can even take up to 5 minutes if you have a slow PC but I am having a decent enough PC so I can call it a decent enough PC actually there was a time I used to call it a very super fast PC but thanks to the evolution of of chips and everything this is just a decent enough PC so anyways let's get back to business and let's copy these two permissions and I'll paste these permissions to Android manifest so Android manifest is a file where I'll have to explicitly tell my app that hey these are the two permissions that I need this app to use on the phone it is running okay so let's paste these and let's get back the next thing that I have to do is uh simply paste these per s I've done that then I'll have to copy and paste this activity so that uh our Android app can actually invoke this activity and show palls so let's copy this and let's paste it uh in the activity section so this is one activity and I'll add these activities so these are the activities that super wall needs to show screens in your Android application after it is configured okay so uh awesome now let's um come back to the quick start guide and let's go to the next step configure the Android SDK the next part is to configure the Android SDK so what we need to do is Select cotlin and we'll have to configure this by punching our API key here and I'll tell you in a while where you are going to get the API key so let's uh let's move to main activity. KT and after this line super. oncreate I'll paste super wall. configure and I'll get my API key from here so all you need to do is come to your settings then Keys copy the key and then you can paste this key so let's paste this key here and let's hit Alt Enter so that we can import super wall and you'll see that we are able to import super wall because we have it as a dependency in our build. Gradle this is very important if you don't have this dependency and if you haven't built your app with this dependency you are going to get into trouble anyways let's get back to business and let's get back to the quick start guide we are done with this step let's move on to the next step so I'll navigate to the quick start guide again hit next I have configured the Android SDK let's see how we can present a pay wall so in order to present a pay wall we'll have to Simply invoke this so we'll say super ball. shared. register and we'll name an event and whenever user is paid or subscribed to a paid only feature this should happen now this can be invoking an activity this can be navigating the user to some other activity this can be downloading a file from some secured Source Etc so let's copy this and let's paste it here so I'll simply paste it here and let's add a button here I'll change this UI which is created using compose and I'll get a button here which upon clicking will show the payall okay so let's uh get a button here but before I add this button let's run this app let's see this app is running we have this app up and running we are not facing any errors this is really very important if you don't have an avd created I will say create an avd because it's an important step so let's wait for this to finish and once this device is up and running I'll be back it takes some time and since I'm recording okay so the device is coming online but since I'm running Android Studio then I'm running the cvd and then I'm running my recorder it takes up some resources on this computer and yes it will take some time so if it is taking time for you go ahead grab some coffee and yeah uh it will take some time I'll be back once this is finished so guys as you can see that the CD is running and we can see hello Android displayed on the screen let's add the button so inside this button all I'm doing is let me show you the code and then we are going to run it and see how PS can be shown so this is a button and let me import button and we will import composable button and as for toast we are going to import Android toast and then we are going to import Android log and this is a register method which is in the super wall SDK so we are simply saying that whenever this button is clicked you show this text as a toast which is showing Pall now so showing P now will be displayed whenever I hit the button and then we are invoking super ball. instance. register and we are saying that invoke the event start workout and whenever this event is invoked user will be shown a pay wall and whenever a pay wall is shown to the user once he pays and once he subscribes to the paid feature he'll be shown and this code will be uh executed which in this case is a very simple log message and I'm saying the user has paid so this is a very simple log message the button has a text called filled so let's run this application and let's see if we can show the pball or not now let me give you a heads up uh let it run first the moment I click filled the payall is not shown but simply uh toast with this text has been shown and I'll tell you what the problem here is this particular ABD doesn't have Play Store so you'll have to make sure that your Android virtual device has a Play Store uh up and working and you should should sign in with your Google account and let me show you uh this app in action using my actual device so I'll uh run this app on my actual device and I'll show it to you so let me invoke this app and I'll show you how payall will be shown but before that we'll have to configure this pay wall and we'll have to come back here and we'll click next we have installed the SDK we have configured the SDK we'll present the p P wall and once we present the pay wall this will get checked automatically and the next step is configuring your products now if you want to add products you'll have to do it using play console and uh these are the exact steps for adding your products or Services which you want to offer to your customers you can even offer products and services through Revenue cat but let's come back here and let's add a pay wall so let's come back to campaigns and there is one campaign which is called example campaign and this example campaign uh has an event let me delete this event and we are going to create a new event here and we are going to see whenever this start workout event is triggered show a payall as simple as that so let's show the payall and this is a sample payall which we are going to show to 100% of the users now you can show some pay balls to some users and you can create as many pay walls as you want you can have three to four pay walls and you can test those pay walls and you can see which pay walls are converting well so all this you can do using super wall dashboard you don't have to ship any updates this is very important here and this is one of the reasons people use super wall and people should use super wall because you don't have to ship updates to your app and shipping updates to your app is very risky you might end up breaking something you might end up losing customers in case they are not able to update the app now let's see how we can edit this pay wall so we'll simply click this pay wall and we'll click on edit payall and as you can see that uh this particular interface opens now this is a very important interface and now you can click on all these components that form this payall you can even scroll down and you can change all this text and you can configure it to show your payall so let's say uh welcome to Sigma course and let's show these as a best course ever purchase course so let me click here and I'll say purchase course we can change this and we can also change the trigger so whenever somebody Taps this we are going to say that whenever somebody Taps this they should be able to purchase primary okay and let's create a new product so I'll say Sigma course let us say I have a course and the name of that course is Sigma course and I'll say plan ID is Sigma and automatically daily Pick offer trial is for 3 days free trial and then you have to pay uh 49 cents for say 6 months let's increase it let's say 1449 for a year and let's hit save and yes now you can change the interface and you can match it to your Android apps interface this is really very easy and convenient if you want to show pay balls so this is the payall and you can even add further products and uh you can use JavaScript here you can use custom CSS here and you can change uh the way your pay wall looks okay so let's now test this pay wall in our actual phone let's hit save and I'm hitting save it's updating the payall it sometimes takes some time to update the payall but let's wait for it so this is a physical Android device and I'm connecting it using a USB cable and I'll go and run the app and you'll have to make sure that USB debugging is enabled because if USB debug is not enabled you'll be in trouble so it is asking me to enable USB debugging should I allow it yes I'll have to allow it if I want um my app to work properly so let's now go and run the app from cotland so I'll simply run this app and it has detected the device and let's see if the app runs properly or not so yeah I'm waiting for the app to run and yeah it is running so now let's tap this filled and it is saying showing pay wall and it should show the pay wall that we have customized which means that it should show Sigma course and you can see that this pay wall is presented and we can configure all these buttons and I can always customize this pay wall to change without shipping updates to the app so I don't have to rebuild the app I don't have to do all the hard work all I need to do is go to the Super wall dashboard and change everything from there and my pay wall will be updated how cool is that so as you saw that we are able to show pay walls to the customers and we can even see which all the pay walls are converting so the basic idea of super wall is very simple you can show your pay walls you can customize your pay walls without actually shipping updates all from the Super Ball dashboard you can see which pay balls are converting well and you can change your pay balls to make sure that you are making good enough purchases so I hope that you like this video and if you want to know more about super wall I'll drop the links in the description make sure you create an account and try super wall uh which in my opinion is a game-changing product because it kind of changes the way you handle your Android app subscriptions so I hope you like this video thank you so much guys for watching this video and I will see you next time,TRUE

code that will be in the description if you are new to one entry you are going to get this promo code and if you use this promo code you are going to get one entry project for free this is only applicable for first project so you can use it and once you click on create your project will start creating now project creation takes some time so we are going to go to theme forest and we are going to look for a template let me look for a template theme forest portfolio template and I'm going to show you how to use theme forest template with one entry so there are a lot of templates uh I'm going to pick one and I'm going to buy that template you can always try this with free template if you want but I'm going to find some premium template and I'm going to buy that template and I'm going to use one entry with that template now this is a template that I really like this is basically a portfolio react template and uh it is an xgs template and you can see that there are a lot of designs that are already built you can download the CV and then about me looks pretty good to me plus this template is responsive let me show you this is responsive and I like this hamburger animation so I'm going to buy this now you might say that why are we buying templates we are ourself web developers see the thing is that we are buying template because we are going to focus on a bigger problem um and let's focus on that bigger problem which is managing backend and that problem is also going of solved when we have one entry so let's see if our one entry project has finished it is still creating this project so it kind of takes 7 minutes so we are going to wait for it and in the meantime I'm going to buy this template so let's buy this template I'll click on buy now all right so clicking on buy now and I'm going to punch in all the details and then I'm going to create my account and then I'm going to continue so let's do one thing let's continue with Google I'm going to continue with Google continue and I'm going to wait and I'm going to provide all the details to it and after providing all the details details I'm be I'll be back now it is asking for my credit card details I'm going to punch in all the details and uh then I'll be back so as you can see that this template is available I can download this template and I can download all files and documentation so let's download this and it has zipped it and it is downloading all the files so this is the template that uh I have received let's do one thing let's open this template this is a template that I've received I'll right click on this and I'm going to extract all so let's extract everything from this template and once everything is extracted yeah so it has extracted inside a folder and there are two folders here one is Adena one is documentation let's open the documentation and see how to get started so let's do one thing let's try it out ourselves so I'm going to open this in vs code and let's do Yan Dev Yan Dev and Yan install Yan and after Yan install I'm going to run Yan Dev and now let's do Yan Dev and let's see if it is working or not so yeah this template is working uh let me click here and yes this is working download CV is working this sample.pdf is downloading amazing so this template is working working pretty fine now we are going to see how we can integrate one entry uh inside this okay so there are a lot of pages that we can manage as per our choice so I'm going to delete some pages and I'm going to keep some pages let's do one thing uh let's come back to this one entry our project is ready let's click here and I'm going to show you how to do it using npms so now I'm going to adjust this template so that we can use one entry with it the very first thing that I'm going to is I'll go to pages and I will show you how it looks like and after that I'll do yarn Dev and uh this is how this template looks like at this point I'm going to select one version of this template which is home horizontal and I will split all these menus into different pages at this point when you click on about it Scrolls down and when you click on service it Scrolls down same goes for portfolio and testimonial as well but I'm going to make sure that this opens on different pages so let's create all those pages is so this is basically how my website now looks like I have this homepage about page and contact page my template had a lot of pages but these are the pages that I picked up so that I can explain you one entry and we can build a beautiful website using one entry so let's understand everything one by one let's start from pages so inside of pages I have two pages here I have created a homepage and I've created an about page this is the homepage that I want to populate let me go to home and this is the homepage and let us say this is the content content that I want to populate so let's call it introduction I'll call this introduction and I'll go to pages and once you have created a homepage in one entry you can click on edit and now you can attach an attribute to this page I'll show you how that works so we'll go to attributes and we can create an attribute so we'll say that I want to create attribute and I'll call it intro homecore intro and marker is going to be homecore intro and this is going to be for pages and let's create it and once I create it I'll click on settings and I'll say the attribute name is homeor intro and the value of the attribute is hello I am it's it's going to be string first of all and I'll create it let's say homecore intro I'll say hi which stands for homecore intro and once I have this attribute I'm going to fill it so let's refresh and we are going to fill this attributes so now if I come back to pages I have this home intro attribute and I'm going to fill the value of this as hello I am rockers Nelson okay so this is what I have saved now we'll come back to our CMS page where we have already logged in we'll come to settings and we'll click on app tokens and we are going to get one app token so let's copy this app token and we are going to install one entry package so we'll say and Yan add one entry and also while I'm installing one entry um it is done great so let's run Yan Dev once again Yar Dev once again and I'll wait for all these pages to load and yes everything is working fine you can also have this picture as a link if you want to add an attribute where this picture is a link you can do that as well I'll show you how I can populate this I am rockers Nelson I'll come back to one entry documentation I'll click on npm I'll click on installation we have done that we'll click on usage now and this is what I'm interested in so I'll come back to my homepage which is index.js and I'll say server site props so we are going to write a function which is server s side props and no we are not going to comment it out we are going to write it so let's say server site props is a function and yes we are going to return the props and what are those props I'm going to tell you what those props are but before that we are going to copy the URL and we are going to populate our URL so let's populate our URL this is how you can populate the URL awesome and I'm going to paste my token here so I just got the token and my token was copied to the clipboard and then inside this Lang code I'm going to say enus and I'll extract out pages from it because I want pages and I'll say a wait con pages is equal to pages doget I think pages doget is the method but we'll see the documentation it's called pages. getet root Pages this is this is what I'm interested in so I'll say pages. get root Pages await pages. get root pages and we are going to pass in the pages so we'll say pages so p can be received as a prop here and once again we can pass pages to our hero section so pages and uh let's open hero and let's accept Pages here and uh just like we had this hero content here we'll say um I am Pages Dot and we'll find the attribute so let's do one thing let's say use effect and let's write uh console.log pages and we are going to Simply complete this uh use effect all right so let's see if we are able to get the pages here it says Define one entry is not defined we'll have to import it that's not a problem and yes we can Define one entry from one entry this should work now Define one entry is now working and just so that you can see I'll pull it and as you can see we have an array where we have two pages Pages uh let me move myself here and as you can see we have two pages the very first page is the homepage the second page is the about page we can create contact page as well but for now we have um this page and about page and where are the page attributes by the way so if you want to see the attribute values this is the attribute value so you'll say I want the attribute values and I want to extract out high from it and I want to extract out the value so let's do one thing we'll say okay Pages zero um so instead of saying hello I am hero content. name I'm going to say this is Pages zero and then we need attribute values and we need uh zero do value let's see if this is correct so attribute values then we need high from the attribute values and then we need this um value okay so I'll say do high do high value and let's say let's see if this is being populated or not and as you can see this is being populated now this is coming from the CMS it's not coming uh it's not hardcoded or it's not coming from my um source code it's coming from the CM CMS and I'll show you why it is coming from CMS if you go to pages and if I click here and if I go back to the attributes so page attributes if I say hello I am Harry and if I update it and if I reload my page you'll see that this will be changed to I am hello I am Harry so I'm waiting for it to change as you can see it has changed to hello I am Harry which means it was not coming from the source code directly rather it was coming from the CMS so we can pull the content and we can populate the content same thing can be done here we can have some other attribute values we can create another attribute which will be called description so you can go to settings and you can say I want to create another attribute and this is DEC and this is being created for pages and then again you'll edit this so for Pages we have a DEC attribute as well and we'll say DEC marker also DEC and this will be a string let's create it and now if you go to pages and if you go to this attributes you can actually populate it so we'll say DEC and I will put this description and in place of this description hero cont do description I'll say I don't want description rather I'll say Pages 0. attribute values. dec. values so if I reload this page I hope that this works attribute values. high. Val it says what does it say it says canot read properties of undefined reading values let's see how the page is working all right so let's do one thing we'll say question mark dot do attribute values question mark dot so that if it is is not there it will be undefined and in the meantime we are going to debug what the problem is so this is how our pages are coming if we go to attribute values uh there is a DEC and then another attribute value is high so there should be two attribute values actually so uh on this page we just have a DEC and there is no high we will actually have to add DEC here so we are going to add Dees here value is going to be do you want to use it yes we still want to use it and value is going to be string let's save it and after it is saved we'll go back to our page we'll click add it and we'll come back to attributes and DEC will have a value home intro has this and DEC uh so let's punch in the values here so the value here will be this and the value here is going to be um hello I am Ro rockers Nelson and this should work now so the market here is high Market here is DEC now if I come back here uh you'll see that this high as well as the dec will be populated so if I refresh here you'll see that we have attribute values high and we have attribute values DEC and both the values are populated so you will see hi I am rocker Nelson and also you'll see this now I'll change this and show it to you that it is being changed so I'll say I am Harry Nelson and I'll say I am a Dev instead of saying I am a freelancer i I'll say I am a Dev so it's still saving let's wait for it to save it has saved so I'll say I am Dev and I'll click somewhere outside so that it can save it now if I refresh you'll see that this content is coming from my one entry CMS so it's saying I am a Dev front end react developer based in USA now we can do the same thing with about we can do the same thing with contact and our pages will function the way they should okay now if you have a lot of pages you can create a dynamic route in nextjs and you can pull p dynamically but I was showing this just for demonstration you can complete your website in a very similar way so we just saw that how attributes work now we are going to see how menus work so let us say I want to show a menu I'll call it footer menu footer unor menu and I'll give it a marker of FM so that I can easily get it in my code so I can use FM to get it in my code I'll click on ADD and this menu has been added now I can click here and I can add some pages to my footer menu so let us I want to add this home and I want to add this about to my footer menu and both of these pages are added to my menu I'll say show the menu so that all these men uh all these pages will be shown uh inside this menu I'll come back to my CMS page and I'll click on menus and this is how you can get menus so let's get the menu so I'll come back to index and I'll say menu and let's pull menus from one entry as well and I'll say con value is equal to get menus by marker we already have a FM marker inside our inside of one entry CMS and let's console log value as value okay let me double check the name of the marker is FM here we have FM now let's refresh and we should see the menu so it says menu is not defined what's wrong what's wrong okay so instead of menu we should say value we'll reload and I am expecting to see a menu here which I am not seeing okay so this will be shown in the server s side because get server s side props run on server site so we'll have to check here and as you can see that we have this menu this is titled as footer menu and we can display this menu uh if you want to see the value here you can always see that but I think the best use case of uh using this menu would be inside app.js so uh we can either do it here or we can also uh pass this data to a component so that it can display the data of the menu so what you'll do is you'll go to your footer and you will populate your footer with this menu and then you can dynamically change the content and title of this menu so this is how menus work in one entry all right so now that we have learned about menus let's Implement one so I'm going to come to comp components and I'm going to create a new component called footer so let's call it footer. jsx I'm going to write rafc and let us say uh we have some styles on this footer and let's say height is going to be 34 pixels and color is going to be white and let's say uh we have um background color is equal to this one um and also let's do text line set enter uh as my Lama co-pilot is suggesting and let's say copyright All Rights Reserved okay and let's come back to index.js and I'm going to say um I I want to add footer as well so let's add a footer and let's import a footer so I'll say import footer from components footer and this is how the footer looks like copyright All Rights Reserved now let us say that I want to show a menu in my footer wherein we have Facebook and Twitter and all the other social URLs okay so let's say this is called a menu prop and I'm going to say I want to pass the menu prop and I'm I'll say menu is equal to I'll say menu is equal to meu is equal to menus. get menus by marker and I'm going to give this as social marker okay so the marker name is social I'll come back to menu and I'm going to create a new menu so I'll say name is social and marker is also social okay so the marker is social name is social let's create this menu and after I create this menu I'm going to open this menu so let's open this menu social and if you want to add some pages to this menu you can simply do this so I'm adding home to the menu and I'm adding about to the menu uh for a while let's assume that these are social Pages or let's say these are all the pages that exist in our CMS okay and after I've done this I will simply see how this menu looks like so if I say console.log menu and if I see how it looks like just a moment uh let's reload this page so it says menu is not defined let me fix this menu is not defined menu is equal to this console.log menus okay so let's reload this and I guess it's going to work after we reload yes it is working and let's see if we have all the menus at place or not so as you can see that this social menu has all the page URL so you can see that this has page URL as home this has page URL is about so we'll simply pass this menu to footer so we'll say menu is equal to menu and we are going to Simply map over this menu and we'll say ul and then we'll say menu do map and let's accept menu from the props so we are going to accept the menu from the props and then we'll say menu do map and after we say menu. map we are going to do this and item Dot Page URL this is what I want so page URL is uh what I want okay so key is Page URL and we are going to show the page URL and let's see how it looks like so menu. map is not a function okay so menu do map is not a function let me see what is wrong here so what I've done here is I feted the menu and I've passed menu. Pages as props and as you can see um we have passed this menu to the footer and finally we are basically returning we are saying a return Li and this is what we are returning and this should be visible here so it is not being visible here let me see what the problem is let's remove all these stylings and and instead of doing these stylings we can simply return this UL as is so I'll show you how it looks like we can definitely make it better by styling but this is how it looks like if we remove the Styles so I've styled it a bit and this is how it looks like you can always convert it to uppercase if you want so you can do something like uh styles do menu item dot uh sorry uh item. page url. to uppercase and this is how it is going to look like uh after you have converted it to uppercase so two uppercase is not a function so if I have a string to uppercase Okay C is capital let me fix it and this is how it's going to look like and you can always say hrf is equal to you can import link from next link so I can say import link from next link and I can add an HF HF is equal to and it's going to be item. p URL okay and this is how you can show a menu now our menu is really very simple but you can always show the menu as you want now our menu is really simple but you can always add styles of your liking in your menu so this is how it looks like so you can have this menu here you can always style it the way you want so this is how menus work in one entry now I'll come back to forms and we'll see how we can see forms in one entry so in order to see how forms work in one entry you can and create a form so I'll say uh contact form contactor form and marker will be CF marker is just so that you can very conveniently write the code now let's edit this menu contactor form form title for the site is going to be contact us this is what you are going to show on your website and it has been saved successfully let's come back to form field and we are going to create a template and we'll say contact form and we'll say CF and we'll say for forms for form and we'll click on Create and once you do that you should see your form so if I come back to manage forms there is a contact form you can edit it and you can add attributes to it so we'll say contact form form attributes and we'll say CF and here we are going to say for forms and you can create it and inside this for forms we have this form attributes which we can populate so if you want to add a new attribute you'll say name and marker will be name type is going to be string and then let us say for some reason we want to take number also contact number so we'll say contact and then we'll say contact and this is going to be integer okay let's click on create let us say these are the only two Fields uh or let's also add description description and then we'll say DEC and then do you want to use it yes we want to use it and this is going to be a string let's click on create now this form has been created I'll come back to manage forms and if you click on this pencil if you go to form field you can always choose a template I want to choose my contact form template and then you can select a set of attributes that these are the attributes that I want to use with my form and then you can populate this form and uh you can store data so this is how forms are going to work and this form can easily be displayed on the website on the contact page all right so here comes the fun part we have a form here and we want to fill this form so that the data gets directly into the one entry CMS how do we do that is the question Let's uh see how we are going to do it so if I come to my one entry dashboard you'll see I have a form here and the name of this form is contact form what are the attributes of this contract form I'll uh show you name contact and DEC are the attributes so name contact and deese so um I'll change it to name contact and DEC so let's um come back to our contact page this is our contact page and as you can see that we have onsubmit is equal to uh send email I'll change this to submit form and we are going to create this function oops uh we are going to copy this and let me say const submit form is equal to to and we are going to write this function but before that I want to make sure that we have this form and input type is email placeholder is email let me change this to type is equal to phone and uh let's say value is equal to form. phone and what is form form is going to be a use state snipp it uh I'll remove this ref I'll say use State snippit form set form is equal to use State and we are going to use an empty form so form class name is equal to contact form ID is equal to my form we have a text and name is name here and then once again we have um type is equal to phone here and name is phone here let's change name to contact and also let's change to DEC here and this is going to be your description okay and value is going to be and we don't populate value like this we poate value like this form. DEC so we have form. DEC we have form. name and we have form do phone okay form. name and we are going to add on change to all all of these input tags so let's copy this input Let's uh change on change here as well and let's on change here as well and we'll say cost on change sorry con handle change is equal to and I'm waiting for my llama coder to suggest me some good code and yes I think it has done some good job here yeah let's see if it works so it says use state is not defined we'll have to fix it by importing use State use State and yeah so if I reload it says e is not defined okay so let me change it to ANF F and E and yeah this should work now yeah so if I type something here it is changing so in order to submit this form I'm going to create an API but before that let's retrieve the data from the form so whenever I have submitted this form so let us say if I type something here and then I just type something here and then I type something here I want to ensure that whenever we click on submit the data is logged here but before that we'll have to um click on E do prevent default and uh submit form so we are saying on submit is equal to submit form so whenever we are submitting the form the data is getting reloaded but this time when we are submitting the form the page is not being reloaded because because we have ensured e. prevent default now as you can see that we have current DEC and name here I want to make sure that um I want to make sure that this email shows phone because we have altered everything except the placeholder so let me sa phone here and once we have this data I want to send this data to an API so let's create an API in nextjs so we have this pages but we don't have an API so let's create an API slash submit form. JS and this is going to be a backend API now I'm going to create this function as async and I'll say let r is equal to await Fetch and slash API SL submit form and this is going to be a post request so we are going to say method is post so method is going to be post so here I have the Syntax for post request so we have a name as form. name and then we have uh contact as form. contact and we have DEC as form. DEC and here in our API we have just set request. body so let see if we are hitting submit are we getting this object or not yes we are getting this object so all we need to do now is submit this to one entry so we are going to import Define one entry from one entry so here I have said let rest is equal to await r. Json so basically we are putting a post request on this and our endpoint looks something like this this is a Syntax for posting data to one entry as you can see we have data we have form identifier we have uh value is equal to form data. post form data which is used to post data to one entry CMS let's see if this is working or not so as you can see that I have this form so I'll refresh this I'll say name is Harry and then phone is 7777777777 and this hey I am good and let's hit submit so the moment I hit submit I should see something um something in the console here itself and as you can see we have an object let's try to open this object and it has form data so we basically have submitted the form so now let's check the CMS if we have the data there or not so if I go to managing forms and if I go to contact form let's click on this pencil and let's click on data sent by Form you'll see that uh the data that I've submitted has been punched here so we have this Harry we have this phone number and we have this tesc the last thing that I want to do here is that I want to make sure that this form is reset so I'll say set form I'll say set form and I'll set this form to an empty form so that we don't see any data here after we have submitted so let's uh once again um try to submit this form and let's say hey I am good how are you doing I need to inquire about let us say this is a website on my portfolio about a website I want you to build okay so let's click on submit and the moment I click on submit this data has not yet cleared let me see why this has happened so submit form so the problem here is that we have this ref is equal to form here so we'll have to make sure that this ref is not creating problems so it seems that the surf is not creating problems now and also I want to add one more thing I want to add add uh alert alert data has been submitted successfully okay so data has been submitted successfully and then we have this submit and let's reload this page once again I want to reload this and I'll simply say Harry and then we have this phone number and then we have this hey as message now let's click on submit data has been submitted successfully and the moment I click on okay I'm expecting this form to clear up but it is not clearing up so this is something to worry about let me see why it is not working so I'll change the initial value of this form to an object which has all the entries as blank and then I'll do the same here and it will be working because uh at this point the name deese and contact are getting undefined here in the form so let's reload this page yet again and let's try to fill this form again and let me see what this error is default value or value props uh instead of setting children on text area okay got it so let's not set the children in text area because uh react is suggesting us to not do that so let's do value is equal to value is equal to form. DEC let's do it this way and we should not have any errors now let's reload the page and yes we don't have any errors now let's let's say Harry and then let's try to fill this again and let's try to fill hey and the moment I click submit the data is getting submitted and it says uncaught in promise so this time if I fill the form and if I say hey and if I click on submit the form is getting cleared and the data is getting submitted so this is how everything works and um this is how you work with forms in one entry so if you want to fetch the data from the forms we can create an endpoint and we can create a get end points and we can say get get forms. JS and so in order to get the data from the form we'll have to use this endpoint which is uh get forms data and it takes um and let's use this one uh get forms data by marker and the first argument is marker second argument is uh enus which is L code so we'll change this to uh form data dot get forms data by marker then we have form identifier and let's see if this works so we'll say Local Host API get forms and yes it is getting me all the information so if you want to see all the information of the forms you can see this way now again you'll have to protect this endpoint if you are using it publicly but this is how you get the data from the forms so this is how forms work in one entry I hope you were able to understand Trend and I hope that now you'll be able to implement any form in one entry so I hope that you were able to understand how one entry works and uh how this one entry is uh useful for storing your content and how it can CER to your content needs uh I hope that this video was helpful thank you so much guys for watching this video and I will see you next time,TRUE

an amazing back end if you have your front end ready you don't have to invest your time developing backend from scratch and aight is storing and managing all your data on the cloud how amazing is that so we'll now move on to a computer screen and we'll see how to build a Blog using app right loud let's get started all right guys so here I am inside my computer screen and we look into aight Cloud app.io so let's go to aight. and we'll go to app right Cloud to build something amazing so I'm assuming that my front end is ready so I'll only be creating back end let's go to nextjs nextjs create next app yes I want to use nextjs and let's search for Tailwind templates Tailwind templates but before we use these Tailwind CSS templates uh let's create a new Next app okay so let's run this command we'll be running this command and I'll fire a terminal here npx create Next Step latest and yes I want to proceed I'll say app right blog and let me call it app right Cloud blog just to make sure that what I'm creating is descriptive no I don't want uh es lint yes I want Tailwind CSS do we need an SRC directory no uh let's not use an SRC directory yes I want to use app router and would you like to customize the default Al as no let's wait for it to install everything and once everything is installed we'll come back and we'll run our app but in the meantime let's log to app right so that we can get started by creating a backend so basically aight is backend as a service I already have an account on aight if you don't have an account you can create one but make sure that uh you are doing what whatever I'm doing as is because I'll be following some steps and if you don't follow them Asis you might be in trouble so let's create a new organization I'll say code with Harry so the very first step for you is to create an organization I'm creating an organization called code with Harry and now I'll click on organization ID uh app right basically uh generates One automatically but if you want to add in some new ID you can add a unique ID and let's select a plan you can always start for free if if you go to app.io uh one thing that I like about them is that you get unlimited projects free of cost with 10gb of bandwidth and 2GB of storage 2GB is a lot uh to get started and if you are making anything serious you can always upgrade so we have created this organization and let's create a new project I want to call this blog and let's name our blog as hunting coder so hunting order is the name of the blog that I want to choose and it is asking me for a region to to deploy I can use Bangalore because I'm in India but uh the thing is that they don't have one at this point and I can always click on notify me whenever this region is available let's go for Frankford because this only seems to be the region which is available now we have hunting coder project created uh it is asking me for a platform choose a platform which platform do you want to choose and I'll click on web and uh I will register my host name I'll say local PC and this is the name of my host name I'll say Local Host you can always choose your domain or versal DOA or gitpod doio whatever you using let's click on next and this is something that we need to install because app right provides you with a package which you can use to connect to the back end so where is our blog project here is the blog let's open this in VSS code and let's fire our terminal and uh let's say npm install app right so that we have app right installed I'll say npm run Dev which will start the dev server and this is how our next USS app is looking at this point so it's still building it yes this is how our nextjs app is looking at this point definitely we'll want to use uh something to fill this template and we want to remove all of this boilerplate code but let's get started by going to the app directory and then page.js and we will be removing this this main tag and let me replace it with Dev and I'll say jsx JavaScript react and let's write navbar is here okay and let's also remove all the global CSS except this Tailwind CSS and let's see how our code is looking at this point so this is how our code is looking at this point it looks pretty good let's use app right now so if you come back to this page they have all the instructions npm install app right we have already done that now this this is how you import app right in web SDK we'll copy this code we'll say next and this is how you create a new client so uh let's import the client first so on our page we'll say import client as uh import client from app right and then we'll copy this code and this contains all the things that we need so it's creating a new client for me let's create a new client inside this function and let's do format docent ment and I'll click on next and you are ready to go congratulations on adding the first platform to your project now I can always add more platforms to my project it's up to me it's my choice I can go for flutter I can even go for some other platform same app same project some other platform so that we can connect to the same back end now let's go to dashboard if you don't know why we are using app right Cloud uh the primary reason is that it takes all the hassle uh out of your code the the meaning of this thing is is that you are writing a back end you don't have to worry about anything like authentication you don't have to worry about storage and with app right loud they are bringing a lot of innovation which is something that I like about them uh authentication is there database is there storage is there function is game changing I'll tell you what functions are and they are also coming up with realtime stuff so that you can create chart apps plus when you use authentication you can use Google authentication GitHub authentication Apple Microsoft uh which means that people can come with their Google account and sign up to your app you don't have to write authentication from scratch okay and you do don't have to worry about any problem that you might face after writing authentications because security has to be taken seriously okay so let's come back to our app and let's see uh what we get at this point so uh the very first thing that I want to uh cover is au so let's create a new user and let's uh name this user as Harry Harry at COD withh harry.com and um I'll simply put some phone number and let's choose the password as Harry so it is asking me to choose a strong password I'll be choosing a stronger password and I'll hit create it says that invalid phone phone number must start with a plus okay we'll add a plus 91 and this is the phone number of the user and let's click on Create and uh this is the username this is the password I don't want to update it but uh this is uh how you can create a new user now this user is UN verified you can always verify this account and uh you can do this programmatically as well but uh let's not add any more labels and let's not play around with this user you can always add a label called admin or premium or some other label uh you can add all those labels programmatically now let's come back to database and let's create a database so the database is going to be blogs because this is going to be our blog we'll give the task of adding a random ID to app right and we'll hit create and the blogs has been created which is simply a database let's add a new collection called blogs so this is how we can create a new collection and inside our blocks database we have a blocks collection and here will be some documents you can always specify a schema and you can go back to documentation which will tell you about how you can use this but at this point I just want to make sure that uh I have a Blog uh inside my blogs collection so let's create a new document we'll create an attribute we'll say uh let's create an attribute called string the key is going to be title so this is a title and uh can be say 200 characters default is uh let's not have a default value yes it is required and we'll create it so everything that you want to create will be here let's create another attribute and this is going to be uh blog HTML blog HTML and size is going to be 2,000 characters uh rather let's make it 5,000 or 8,000 characters because I want to make sure that I have plenty of space for blog and this is going to be required and we'll create another attribute and we'll see if we have anything else now let's add a datetime field and uh it will be created at created at and we can uh make it null and default value can be null and we'll hit create okay and we have uh the title of the blog we have the content of the blog now let's add an author we can say author uh we can also say email or URL let's add something like URL because this is going to be the slug and default value is uh null and this should be required let's say create what else do we have in a blog we have written by which is a user or we can also have a relationship with user like which user has written this blog but I'll keep it simple uh and instead of creating a relationship I can simply add user as a string so we'll say user and size can be uh 20 characters or 30 characters should be fine and uh let's keep it required or we can also give it null because we we always don't have to mention which user has written it and this is a basic collection let's add a new document now and whenever we add a new document and this type of form will be shown to us so title of this blog is going to be JavaScript tutorials let us say and uh blog HTML can be uh say paragraph uh Java Script is a programming language and uh let's close this paragraph you can also use markdown but I'm not using markdown at this point and created at can be today's date you can say today and slug can be JS tutorial and user can be say Harry the note that user is a string not a relation let's click on next and it says please enter a URL so uh slug is basically uh the URL is basically not slug uh so let's do one thing let's go back to attributes and delete this URL because uh I need a slug not URL uh so let's create an attribute and I'll select string and I'll say slug size can be 30 characters or maybe 100 characters because slug can be a long one as well required create uh documents create a document title can be JavaScript tutorial and HTML can be this is JS tutorial and this is the paragraph and let's say it created at and then user is going to be Harry h a r r y Harry and JS tutorial for beginners and let's hit next and document security is disabled if you want to assign document permissions navigate to collection setting and enable document security otherwise only collection permissions will be used okay so uh let's hit on create but in case you want to restrict this document or all the documents that we create here to specific users you can always go to settings and then permissions and you can hit this plus and you can say all guests can read but not update and you can say all users all the users which are created they can say uh create and also read okay so let's update this uh and once we have done this we can enable document security also so when document security is enabled users will be able to access document for which they have been granted either document or collection permission so if you want to enable security at a document level you can go for document security but at this point I'm not enabling document security I'm disabling it let's come back to documents and uh we have only one document at this point now let's come back to uh the dogs and let's see how we can access the documents so this is how you can access a document so uh we'll have to enter a project ID uh this is a JavaScript code uh which will help us get all the documents uh or uh say blocks in our case so let's copy this code databases is equal to new databases client so we have the project ID we have this part set up now let's copy this code and I'll put it inside use effect so we are using react so we'll simply go uh and say use effect use effect snippet and inside the use effect I will fetch all the blogs so this is how we can fetch all the blocks cons promise is equal to document. create document databases. create document now we'll have to import databases as well so we will import databases and ID so let's import databases and IDs as well and uh we'll copy the database ID and collection ID here so let's go back to our app right and we can copy this um collection ID so collection ID should come here and then let's copy the database ID as well so database ID is here so this is our database we have copied the database ID and let's space the database ID here and the same goes for this promise so promise is equal to this and promise. then this let's see what happens so it says use effect is not defined you have to import use effect so import use effect from react does it work should work should work should work you're importing a component that needs okay so we'll have to create this as a client component so use client for client component and this should work now this should work please work so it doesn't work it seems says databases is not defined why is databases not defined I think we'll have to create a new database from client so databases is equal to new databases client yeah it works now so let's come back to our console and let's see if we are getting any documents it says app right exception the document data is missing try again with document data populated so document data is missing and we'll have to see why this is happening so inside our database we have this collection and inside this collection we have this document but it says that this document is not available uh so document security is disabled which is good uh this is the document data and uh we have no activity on this document let's see why is it not fetching all the documents okay so the problem is that we are trying to create a document we don't have to create a document we have to fetch all the documents and in order to fetch all the documents we will come back to this list document documentation and this is going to be the query so let's copy this query and let let's paste it here so we'll say promise is equal to databases. list documents and we'll use the database ID and we'll use the same database ID and collection ID so let's contr X here let's cut it and query. equal and we'll say slug or let's say um let's leave it empty so I want to fetch all the documents and I want to make sure that all the documents are fetched and yes all the documents are being fetched so all the documents are being fetched so we have only one document JavaScript tutorial this is JS tutorial let's add some more documents okay so we'll come back to our uh back end and let's click on create document and we'll say this is going to be say Python tutorial Python tutorial Python tutorial and blog HTML can be uh I'll go to chart gbd I'll go to chart gbd to fill in this data and I'll say generate uh a dummy document with title uh HTML content and then I'll say date and uh what else slug okay and yes it is generating it is generating some dummy document for me okay so I don't like it actually I don't know why so it is adding the header title is there section is there so let's copy this and let's add it to blog HTML and create it at canb today and this can be Python tutorial sorry and user can be Harry and I'll click on next and I'll create this then let's create another document I'll say uh jQuery tutorial so likewise we can add even more documents and we can create a UI and display all the documents using our UI so let's do one thing let's create a state here so I'll import use state from react use State and uh let's create a state called blogs so I'll say use State step it and we'll say blogs set blogs is equal to an empty array okay and we'll say promise dot then and uh after getting the response we'll say uh let's uh change the response uh sorry let's change the blocks and set the blocks as the response which is going to be an array. documents and I want to make sure that the response. documents is an array and yes it is an array so response. documents is an array and will display all the blogs and in order to display a Navar here we will create a component called Navar so let's create a folder called components and inside the components we'll have a navb bar. JS and let's go to chat GPD and I'm going to tell chart GPD that please generate a navbar using HTML CSS uh sorry HTML and Tailwind okay and it will give me a jsx Navar but it it's not giving me a jsx Navar I don't know why but um I think that should be fine because uh ra fce and this is the Navar let's remove this comment let's remove this one we'll say hunting coder hunting coder and let's import the Navar here so navbar let's import Navar first import nav bar import Navar from components Navar and let's say we want to insert the nav bar here and a nav bar is here and chart GPD has generated a nice nav bar and yeah it's looking good on mobile as well so this is our nav bar let's let's see uh create a block pach showing all the blocks in similar color schemes scheme using jsx uh at the starting of the video I told you that I'm assuming that UI is already created so I have other UI videos in case you want uh to watch UI videos but this is how we can say blogs. map and this is this is amazing I mean let's copy this and I'll show you why I'm calling it so amazing so after nbar after nbar I'm going to say blogs. map and blog is going to have a title and it has blog HTML I guess yeah it's called blog HTML inside our documents yeah just is called blog HTML so let's call uh call it blog HTML blog HTML and is it displaying the blog HTML yeah but this is not how it's going to work uh let's add another attribute in the blog or we can always pass the blog HTML convert it to text and then take some part of the text we can do that as well but uh let's see how this is looking and we can add a read more button generate a read more button so this is how a read more button is going to look like read more button uh and it is adding a read more Buton to the same thing let's copy the button and let's paste the button here and uh we are living in an AI era guys so uh do not hesitate to use AI we should be using AI whenever we can and now I'll say generate a Blog Page in a similar color scheme generate a generate a Blog Page uh using similar color scheme taking slug as slug in the URL let's see if it can understand this otherwise we'll have to uh create it on our own and it is using react router Dom uh I want to use nextjs but let's tell it that I want to use let's stop it and we'll say I am using nextjs I'm using nextjs URL I am using nextjs so it is not going to use react router Dom now so we'll create a file called slug DJs inside Pages directory but uh we are not using Pages directory we are using App directory so inside app directory we can create a folder called Slug and inside slug we can say page.js and inside this page.js we can do the same same thing let's copy this code and let's paste this code and it is using server side props I don't want to use server side props rather uh this is going to be a server component nextjs has changed we are on version 14 if I'm not wrong yes we are on version 14 of nextjs now and version 14 of nextjs has different ways of doing things I'll show you what those ways are so inside This Server component we'll fetch all the data so whatever we are doing in side of get server side props we are going to do that here and once we have done it which means that we are on the server once we have done it uh we have all the content so we have the blog data and we can fetch it using app right uh and obviously we are going to fetch it using app right but let's let's remove this for now and we'll simply display the slug so we'll just display the slug here and we'll fix it later we'll fix it later so slug Slug and let's remove this get server s side props and if I go to say local SL something it should show me something it says peram is not defined why why why why perams is not defined slug is equal to perams uh slug is equal to perams so title and content are in the props uh slug should be in the perams okay so either we can say perams here or we can simply add slug here to get the slug and how do I know this I've read the documentation you can also read the documentation and if I reload this we we are getting the page but not sure why it is not rendering properly so we are getting slash something here but why is this something not getting rendered here uh is still something that I cannot understand let's try to type something so if I try to type something it is coming but this thing is not working so I'll have to see why okay so we don't have any slug we don't have any slug the slug is empty so when I say slug we don't have any slug which means that nothing is being rendered so if I say the slug and if I say content here here uh there okay so I've written something wrong so this is how our page is going to render but it is not rendering properly because uh slug is not coming properly so let's see how I will get the slug so so we have app /blog SL Slug and then page.js and then perm. slug okay so I'll have to do something like this so I'll say perms and inside the perams will be the slug so this is how it is going to work so the slug something content here let's add the nav bar as well so um we'll wrap it inside the anchor tags and I'll add a nav bar so import nav bar import import Navar and let's wrap it inside uh inside these uh anchor brackets and yeah this is our blog so the homepage of our blog is going to look something like this and we can always say slash blog poost SL slug so I can move this slug inside a folder called blog post okay that is that is up to me I can either do that or uh in fact let's do it so let's go to app and inside app we can create a folder called blog post new folder blog post and let's move this to this luck to blog post and now if I go to SL block poost slash something it will be displayed like this okay now let's refine the page so I've added something um these Slug and all those those text let's remove all these texts and here should be the title of the document and here should be the content of the document and if I need any other information uh of the document I can add it here okay let's come back to this page and uh we can add a link tag so we can import link from next link so let's import link from next link and we'll say that so we'll say that link HF is equal to something and let's add the title so whenever somebody clicks on the title they should be redirected to this page so HF should be equal to the slash blog post so let's add a template literal so I'll say SL blog poost SL blog post and Slash blog. Slug and this will be the slug of the blog okay okay so whenever somebody clicks on [Music] the let's go back and whenever somebody clicks on this title they should be directed to the blog and yeah they are being directed to the blog now all we need to do here is that we need to convert this to text so in order to convert HTML to text we will simply create a function and uh we can ask chart jbd to create it so write a function to convert HTML string to PL string and it has given me a function and I'm going to use this function so let's copy this function and let's put this function right after our use effect and HTML to plane and I'll say HTML to plane control X HTML to PL text and I'll give blog. HTML and it is giving me the text now and I can always get first few characters maybe first 20 characters so PL text. TR return PL text. trm and let's take only 10 characters so I'll have to do do subst strr do substring 0 to say 20 characters and then I can include a triple dot I can include a triple Dot and you can always do all those things if there are if there are any more characters than 20 characters you will add triple dot otherwise you will not add triple dots you can do all those things but I'll keep it really very simple but let's add some more characters to this I'll make it 50 maybe because uh 20 looks too less so I've added 50 this is JS tutorial whenever somebody clicks on the JS tutorial they should be directed to the JS tutorial and the Navar should also direct to slash when click and let's change this to a link we'll change this to a link import link from next link import link from next link yes so whenever somebody clicks on Hunting coder they should be directed to this page then JavaScript and then Python tutorial yes so aight is basically fetching all the documents and let me remove this s dfsdf why is it not being removed I will have to check so where is this SDF SDF I have written SDF SDF somewhere and this is on the slug page stf stf why is it not going stf stfy is it coming here let's search for this string so it it is inside page.js of blog post okay so it it is inside this page.js of blog post let's remove this and do I have a page.js inside slug oh I by I mistakenly copied this instead of cutting so I'll have to delete this slug so let's delete this slug because I have it inside blog post and yeah it should work now so now the next step is going to be fetch the correct title using Slug and populate the blog post let's go so we'll come back to the app right documentation and we are going to fetch a new document in fact we are going to fetch using a query and we are going to say slug equals this so let's copy this code and we'll say query. equal and we'll say slug should be equal to this so uh let's get everything from here we are going to import client database ID from Mite and then we are going to get all this we are going to get all this code right back here and let's create it as a client component but before we create this as a client component we will have to fetch this document on the server site in fact we don't even have to fetch this from the server site it is going to run on client uh let's copy this we have copied This Promise is equal to this uh let's remove this and this time we are going to say query dot equals and we'll say slug should be equal to slug okay slug should be equal to slug query do equal slug should be equal to Slug and we are going to get the promise and then we'll say whenever This Promise resolves whenever this promise resolves we should get we should get the document so whenever the promise resols we should get the document and let's remove this we are going to get the response once the prise resolves so let's reload this page now again there is some syntax error it seems what is the syntax error I cannot spot the syntax error okay so there there is an error in some opening closing tag it seems so promise dot okay promise is equal to this okay so we have a use effect here let's remove this use effect uh but if I remove this use effect everything is happening on the server um which should be fine I mean even if it's happening on the server this should be fine so if I reload it says use state is not defined so let's remove use state where is use state where is use state so I have use State somewhere use State okay let's remove this and now it should load say query is not defined so we are going to import query from map right query and yeah it works but we have some hydration error we'll ignore it we'll change class to class name soon but let's see if we are getting this block printed or not so we are not getting this response printed and it should be printed inside uh our terminal so let's open our server side terminal and yeah it is being updated here as you can see so if you say response. documents documents so if you say response. documents response. documents it should print only the documents so we have the user we have the slug we we have the title we have everything so let's do one thing so response do document Z is going to be that document now can we pass this response. document zero here so can we pass this somewhere here yeah we can actually pass it how do we do that we'll have to create this as a client component and then we'll run this inside use effect so let's do it so let's say uh use client use client and let's wrap it inside use effect snipet use effect snippet and let's wrap this entire thing inside use effect snippet format document and response. documents will now come to our this console so it says use effect is not defined import use effect from react and and yeah we have this document here so all we need to do now is we'll say use State snippet and we'll call it Blog blog not blog post so blog set blog is going to be null which is going to be uh undefined blog is undefined initially not null it is going to be undefined initially and then we are going to right click format document and then we are going to Simply get the blog. title and blog dot do blog HTML populated here so we are going to say set blog response. document Z this will update the title of the blog and let's reload this page and see if everything is working no it says use state is not defined okay so blog. title undefined cannot read State title undefined so we'll say question mark Dot and yeah so the slug JavaScript tutorial this is Javascript tutorial and let's use dangerously set inner HTML so we'll say dangerously set inner HTML is equal to underscore HTML so we'll add the object underscore HTML is going to be this contr x control V and this should work now so it says dangerously set in HTML is not like it expected it so uh underscore uncore HTML should be the markup okay so it should be underscore uncore HTML instead of underscore HTML and yeah it is being rendered now so let's remove the slug I want to remove this the slug from here and this is how you create a blog using HTML CSS JavaScript and aight so you can keep on adding more blogs by going to aight cloud and uh you can use different functionalities of aite you can also create a storage you can use a lot of other features that are available in aight so let me know in the comment section how you like this video I have updated the title and description as well uh so the title and meta description has been updated so that our website looks good you can go ahead and make more pages like about Services contact and use different features of aite thank you so much guys for watching this video and I will see you next time",TRUE

is it is going to take very less amount of time not even five minutes much lesser than five minutes so let's wait for it to activate the pro plugin and as you can see I've have not edited this video Tada your site is ready I guess it took around 30 40 seconds now one thing I want to suggest is you should wait for some time until element is installed everything is provisioning and only after everything is provisioned I will recommend you to use this hosting because Elementor takes some time to cool down and install everything it's a personal suggestion otherwise if you want to use it right away you can always do that but at least wait for 5 minutes let me tell you about this site log is on do you see that site log is on I'll tell you about that if you click on manage this website and you go and scroll down you'll see the site lock what is a site lock basically your site is locked until you uh ensure that everything is working and until you decide to make your website live there is this pin code which you'll have to enter whenever you are going to or trying to access your website this is just for security purpose and anybody who access your website before it is finalized will have to enter this spin so if I click here it says sorry this website is hidden right now you'll have to enter a pin so anybody who wants to access this website will have to punch in this pin and only after he or she punches in the pin will he or she be able to access my website so as you can can see I can always edit my website with Elementor because I am logged into my WordPress hosting and if somebody wants to preview this site they will have to enter this pin which in my case is 6595 6495 I guess I hope I have entered it correctly let's wait for it and only if you have entered it correctly you will be able to access your website and once you have entered this correctly you will see your website and your website is basically ready you don't have to do anything but you can always customize it you can change the images you can go ahead and you know upload your logo you can change the menu bar you can change all these images and you can customize your website as per your liking very soon I'm going to show you Elementor AI as well but before that let's click edit with Elementor let's wait for this it's loading the Elementor plugin and you can customize your website now let us say I want to add some some some elements maybe a container something you can always go ahead and check the structure this is hero structure this is website title and then again this is another section of the website and you'll see all these sections here so basically it summarizes the structure for you and once you see the structure and everything is looking fine you can always come here and search for widgets there is heading image and a lot of things let's say I want to change this logo how do I change the logo so there is a pencil icon at the right of this logo now once you click this spencil icon you can always upload a file or you can choose a file which you already have in your media library I'll go to my media library and select a file and as you can see this file will serve as my logo you'll have to click save changes and it takes some time definitely to for changes to take place and let's wait for some time and once your website basically up gets this logo in the back end your logo will start appearing it happens instantly so if you reload your website you'll see this logo did you see that this logo has been updated wow awesome now let us say I want to change the menu let us say I want to see home about or something or if you want to see the structure you can always see the structure of the header we have site logo and this WordPress menu how do I change this WordPress menu you'll have to go to Wordpress dashboard and then go to appearance and then menu so appearance and then menus and once you go to menus you can always add another item to the menu so as you can see we only have this single about page in our menu I can always click on view all and add more pages let us say I want to create a page and add it to the menu I can always do that so these are some of the settings which you see you can always play around with these it's a simple WordPress menu if you don't know what a WordPress menu is it's basically collection of pages or collection of posts you can always add more pages here and as you can see we have a page called Elementor sample homepage and I can always click on this homepage and add it to the menu and it is giving me some error Let Me Wait okay so uh it has happened finally and if I reload this page you'll see this home and about is being shown because I have added home to my menu you can create multiple menus in WordPress always but this is how my website is looking um not this this is how my website is looking if you reload your website you going to to see this wow you can always customize this header you can always add more pages to the menu sky is the limit you can do everything the website is looking amazing at this point now you can always preview how your website is looking and if you don't like any item you can always change that you can always change the images you can change all the text that you are seeing now if you click on this new and then if you click on page you can add a new page let me create a page called blog and click on Save and your page has been created I can always edit this block page and I can customize it as per my liking I can click on this plus I can drag and drw the widgets and I'll be able to see how they appear now let us say I want to add this image and let us say I want to add this image as my uh you know topmost image now let us say I want to reduce the width or say height of this image I can always do that by going to style uh did you see that style below edit image this one one and you can simply increase width height Max width Max height it's always good to understand basic concepts of web development like object fit so that you can make it cover and this image will not lose its aspect ratio now you can click on plus and you can always select your structure this is something I love about Elementor all these structure layouts are really very good you can choose this one this will basically stack all the items as you know rows and this will stack items horizontally as columns and you can play around with all these layouts now you'll use these layouts if you want to create something like this or something like um you know let us say I want to add something here what should I take maybe I can drag post so let me search for post I can always use a search bar or let me search for post here manually you can always type for posts you can always type P SS posts and you'll be able to get the post let me drag and drop something here so let's say I want to drag and drop post let me search for post and you will be able to see all the WordPress post which will be visible here okay so it's not looking good because it is basically giving me three posts and three columns which are not looking good you can always delete and you can delete this layout as well if you don't like you can click on plus and let's say I want to Stack all my posts for ially and I want only single column you can always add more structures you can add more layouts and keep on designing your page and it's really very easy now if I drag post here you can see all my posts are visible here now let's go to the Styles and let's style this a bit I'll go to box and add some padding so that it looks little better than it is looking without the padding you can always customize all these things there are a lot of settings and you can always use all all these settings to customize this page sky is the limit and this is really looking good at this point so as you can see this blog page is looking good you can always publish the page once you are done uh and if you spend some more time I'm sure uh I trust you you are going to design a better page than I have done in few minutes but it's always very easy to go live with a website with Elementor and now if you go back you'll be able to open WP dashboard WordPress dashboard is something that you'll keep on coming back and you can go to post you can go to Pages you can you know use all these um menus you can customize these and let us say I want to add this blog page to the menu I can always do that and once I saved the menu you will be able to see that my blog page has been added to the menu now anybody if now any user if he clicks on the blog page he'll be directed to the the blog page and I could have designed it better but again I love this page still I love this page it's looking pretty good and you can keep on adding the post and your post will appear here I love this page I love this logo as well I love the fact that I've designed this website in very less amount of time now if you don't like this website or theme you can always change the theme or you can simply select a theme which you like make sure that you select the theme of your liking from the starting and you are going to be very happy with this now as you can see hosted by third party you'll have different sections here uh now let's Google local WP I want to show you how this local WordPress development tool works if you are developing websites locally you might use this and if you're logging in using Elementor to your local WordPress websites all your WordPress websites will appear in your Elementor dashboard which is amazing actually because you are able to see all your website you have ever built in your lifetime you can always click on hosted by elementa to see your hosted serious websites which you have hosted on elementa but if you have any hobby website and you have logged in using Elementor you can always see those now if you are buying a new hosting let me

started now with element AI you see all these buttons do you see all these buttons where you can uh choose to make it larger or make it shorter or you can always check for grammar let's say I'm

so let me click on this uh button and it has actually corrected it I am Harry and I am a good Chef I can cook Dal and rice very well in Indian style amazing so you can always use this and wow you can actually write a lot of text without leaving element using AI now ai is going to be around and people who are using AI are going to be preferred by companies if you are able to build a website say in 10 hours using Elementor it's going to be much much better than a software developer designing the same website doing the same thing in 10 or 20 days you are going to be faster you are going to get highed faster and you are definitely going to be rewarded for what you are doing now you can always go back to post and write some post this elementor's theme comes with a lot of posts let us say I want to write a post I can say hey I am n AI tool manager and let me add some text as well you can always add some serious post here but I'm going to Simply write AI tool manager here and let's publish this post without an image and you'll see that this post will come without an image let me read load this website and yes let's see if we are able to see the poster yes we are able to see the post but we have not added an image yet so let's add an image now if you go to featured image and if you select the featured image let's add this one as featured image and let's update and once I update this you'll see that I will be seeing my image as well along with my post title and exerpt so as you can see I'm seeing this image which I have added to this post and you can always add some serious posts and you can rank on Google if you write some good post but you don't have to spend a lot of time developing a website because you can always do that with elementer if you are planning to write a blog WordPress is the solution elementer is the hosting solution hands down the best one out there and let's see this website how everything is working you can go to blog can go to home and everything works just fine looking amazing so this is basically how you can build a website using Elementor and using some of the Elementor Pro plug-in widgets and Elementor provides a base theme and Elementor is the best hosting for WordPress because you get Elementor Pro and Elementor Pro is really good now if you want to point a domain to your hosting you can always use these DNS records which you can see below or you can simply click on buy a domain to buy a domain from element but if you already have a domain you can always point this domain to your Elemental hosting uh you can go back and you can simply Point your IP to this IP address or you can simply you know connect domain just enter your domain which you own and Elementor will basically show you the steps of how to verify the ownership of the domain and add it to your Elementor hosted website so you can go ahead you can sign into your hosting provider and Elementor will give you some options of verifying that website and

unless you are making a complex website there's no need of using coding because you can always do everything using Elementor and you can always use drag and drop functionality the themes are there the plugins are there everything works great so I hope you like this video and uh if you like this video make sure to give it a thumbs up thank you so much guys for watching this video and I will see you

and what exactly this hosting is why should you worry about hosting and how hosting impacts your website be it your WordPress website or any other website for that matter before I explain you what exactly hosting is and why hosting is important and which hosting to use I'm going to talk about what exactly is hosting so there is a concept of client and a server client is basically the person who is consuming the website server is a person who owns the website and physical location of that website so basically server will contain all the files which are responsible for generating HTML CSS and JavaScript your server will generate some of the data in the form of HTML CSS and JavaScript and it will send it to the client client will in turn parts that content and that content will then be served to you through your browser in the form of a very beautiful web page so client is responsible for consuming the website and viewing the website server will query the database it will go to the database maybe query the the database to fetch some specific records based on the client's request and then it will send it back to the client so this is a very simple process which occurs in almost every type of website in any type of Hosting you need a server to store the files which will serve the client and this is required to host your website and this server is something that we call hosting now that you know what exactly hosting is let's understand why hosting is important choosing a best hosting is important because it impacts your site speed and your site speed is directly proportional to your Google search rankings any website wants to rank in Google search and generate more and more traffic be it a Facebook be Google or any blog that you are writing you want your website to generate as much as traffic as possible and in order to do that you will want your hosting to work best you want it to be very fast and you want your users to have good experience while using your website now there is this concept of CDN which stands for Content delivery Network let me explain what exactly is CDN and how it can make your website really fast let us say I have a server in Alaska from Alaska let us say there is a user user will get the data directly from the Alaska server now consider a case where Australian users are requesting data from the Alaska server what do you think will happen the data will go from Alaska server all the way to Australia and yes it will impact the site speed in a very similar way if an Indian user comes the data will go from Alaska all the way to India and yes it is going to impact the speed of your website what is the solution a very basic solution is to cash the data whenever first request is Made in India and also in Australia so whenever a second user or third user or fourth user comes back to receive the same web page he will receive the cached version directly from India which will be cached in India and Australia respectively this way the website will be very fast and your users will have the best experience out there because they are going to receive data directly from their country instead of receiving it from Alaska so these are some of the factors that you need to consider while choosing a hosting for any website it might be WordPress website it might be say flask website Jango website you might be working with angular or it might even be as simple as a static website you need to choose the best hosting whenever it comes to your website now that you know what hosting is let's understand what types of hostings exist in the market the first hosting I want to talk about is the cheapest one and it's called shared hosting the concept of shared hosting is very simple your hosting provider will give you a server and he will give the same server to other clients such that all the clients are going to use the same physical resources which will be shared amongst all the users now there might be 100 users thousand users or even 10 thousands of users using the same server same machine the speed might be impacted but it is the cheapest form of Hosting this type of Hosting is intended for hobby websites websites with non-s serious projects let us say you want to host something but you are not very serious about it and there are some of the websites which you know that only few people will use let say you have a team of five people and you are deploying a website for five people you might want to use shared hosting because first it is not a very critical website so you don't want it to be up all the time and it is going to save you a lot of money because it's shared hosting it's shared among different people and all those people are using the same server so you are happy your hosting provider is happy as he makes a lot of money by charging all the customers for the same resources now there is second type of Hosting called Cloud hosting Cloud hosting is the new type of hosting in the market a concept where your site lives on the cloud that is your hosting provider will say that do you want me to host this website on my resources you'll say yeah I want to host this website on your resources he'll take the website and he'll host it simply and give you a link how you should not worry about how he's doing it how he's managing everything it's on the cloud and it's available and you can even scale it up such that if a lot of users comes to your website your users will not be impacted but definitely you'll have to pay more by scaling up this is a very good option for people who don't want to understand what hosting is they don't want to focus on all these things they don't want to focus on TX and they just want the website to go live somehow and focus on their business instead of focusing on hosting Tech cloud and all these things now the third type of Hosting I want to talk about is VPS it stands for virtual private server now let's understand what it is your hosting provider will give you SSH access to a server which actually will not be a real server it will be a virtual server how does it work your hosting provider will have some infrastructure in the data center and from that data center he will somehow give you access to a virtual private server basically he's running a software behind the scenes and he's giving multiple people access to his Resources by providing virtual private servers it will seem to you as if you have a 2GB say 512 TB memory and dis space but it will actually not be a physical server it will be a virtual private server but you will have no way to see that it is a virtual server it will just work like a dedicated server of 2 GB Ram 512 GB of storage or maybe 1 TB of storage or maybe 8 GB Ram 1 TB storage and it is going to be cheap because your hosting provider will actually share the RAM and resource and other stuff he has the option to do that is what I mean and which is why on the same infrastructure he will serve a lot of customers but hosting providers customers will see that server as a dedicated server which will be a virtual server actually but it is going to be cheap it just works fine and I personally like virtual private servers a lot because it helps you practice Linux and also it is one of the best options out there with minimum outage sometimes yeah you might see the resources bottleneck but again it's the best option sometimes specifically when you want to prototype something and understand how things are working behind the hood then comes dedicated hosting and in dedicated hosting you actually get a server which you own it is a dedicated server you get the physical 2 GB of RAM or 8 GB of RAM or 16 GB of RAM whatever you want to do with the machine will be physically done with the machine nobody is sharing that machine your hosting provider has that machine ready for you and you are paying for that machine you are paying for the resources you are paying for the electricity consumed for that machine and you have SSH access to that machine nobody else is using it there is no software installed you get to decide what to do with your machine your hosting provider has left that entire machine for you now there is a concept of managed hosting and it's my personal favorite when it comes to Wordpress what exactly is managed hosting managed hosting means that your provider will say that this particular website will be hosted by us you don't have to worry about anything let us say I want to write a block called blog withth harry.com blog withth harry.com will be given to that person who is giving me manage WordPress hosting and all this will occur through a dashboard definitely let us say I am buying Elementor hosting I want Elementor hosting which is a managed hosting for WordPress I'll go to the element dashboard I will simply host my website I will get a link and a link to the wp admin I don't have to worry about errors I don't have to worry about PHP I don't have to worry about which databases installed I don't have to worry about auto updates which might bring your website down I don't have to worry about all these things I can simply go to the dashboard and manage my website through my WordPress dashboard it's easy it's for pros and also it saves you from a lot of Errors because no matter how good of a developer you are you will encounter errors and when it comes to Wordpress you might see phsp errors you might see my SQL errors and sometimes your plugins might be the reason of your errors manage WordPress hosting will solve all these issues for you because it's being managed by your hosting provider your hosting provider says to you that you want to host five WordPress websites right just pay us for the five WordPress websites and we'll give you the WordPress dashboard and whatever is required by you you don't have to worry about VPS you don't have to worry about which code is going where you don't have to worry about PHP versions you don't have to worry about which my SQL line is throwing which error everything is managed by your hosting provider and it is really very reliable because your hosting provider knows much better than you what problems are being hosted in your servers an average typical user might fail to deliver the website with 100% up time but your hosting provider will not fail because they have been doing this for years and Elemental hosting is one of the best hostings out there because you get Elementor Pro Plan with Elementor hosting I recommend Elementor managed hosting because first of all it is managed and if you want to host a WordPress website Elementor hosting is the best out there hands down for $9.99 you are getting managed hosting you are getting Elementor Pro features and it is optimized for elementary you might go for some other hosting provider and install Elementary there but it is never going to be better than managed Elementor hosting with Elementor add-ons because Elementor hosting is optimized for all these things so if you're looking for a WordPress website you might want to buy managed WordPress hosting from Elementor and you have four plans in Elementor hosting one is basic then business then we have grow and then we have scale if you want to get started with Elementary hosting you can go with the basic plan otherwise you can go with the business plan you get more storage in business plan and more number of monthly visitors now I see a lot of Hosting where they say we have unlimited bandwidth you can have as many users as you want but in my personal opinion there is no free lunch and there is always some sort of limit at place you cannot have unlimited users on your website for say $10 or $15 never it's not possible and one thing I like about elementary is that they specifically mention that your basic plan will be able to handle at least 25k monthly visitors then your business website will be able to handle at least 50k monthly visitors if you want grow plan then you get three websites with 75,000 monthly visitors and if you want to scale you are basically running a WordPress websites business you can go for the scale plan which in my opinion is great because you get to host 10 websites for $449.99 $5 per website what else you want from them and all this comes with Elementor Pro which is cherry on the cake if you're using Wordpress there is a good chance that you will use Elementor and what I like about this is that Elementor is included with all the plans be it the basic plan or scale plan you get the elemental Pro another cherry on top of this Cherry is that you get the best experience because Elementor hosting is optimized for Elementor Pro plugin so there is a lot of value included to be honest if you go for Elementor hosting so I'll give the link in the description and you can simply check it out for different hosting plans from Elementor and let me know in the comment section what you think do you use Elementor for your websites and do you agree with me when I say Elementor hosting is the best hosting plan for WordPress now let's conclude this video by talking about different factors that might impact hosting of your website the very first Factor I want to talk about is that do you want a basic prototype of your website or do you want to host a serious website if you want to host a serious website with as less downtime as possible you might want to go for Elemental hosting or some sort of serious hosting but if you want to just prototype your website you are in college you want to show it to your teacher just for an hour you might want to go for shared hosting it is going to be the best for college students who are not looking for some serious websites they are learning they are simply showing the assignment to the teacher sometimes you also might want to build a website as a prototype to show your boss or to show somebody or just to experience how WordPress Elementor works you can go for shared hosting because it is going to be the cheapest now let's say you start a hobby block and you don't have a lot of money in your pocket you might want to go for cloud hosting because Cloud hosting plans are really good these days and also you might go for a VPS because you get a VPS for $4 $5 there are different type of services to get VPS you can go search for different hosting providers who are providing the VPS services but you got the point you will learn a lot of Linux if you are working with VPS plus VPS are cheap you can do different things on the same VPS because I'll tell you an incident where I was using a VPS for my Python Programming I was doing some WordPress hosting on that and also I had some notes hosted on the same VPS and I was using this $5 VPS for all bunch of different things I was using it as a Google Drive clone because I was storing a lot of files in there and there was a python HTTP server which I was using to download files so in a $5 VPS you can get a lot of things done I don't want to open my laptop all the time I sometimes want to use these type of VPS where I can do something which will run overnight I don't want to run my laptop overnight for one it might harm my laptop secondly I don't want to take the risk of turning on my laptop all the time because I don't want my electricity to go through my computer and my socket board all the time might have nothing to do with you but this is my personal opinion I prefer VPS if I want to run an overnight Python program or an overnight build process it's simply easy for me simply go and log into the SSS terminal of the VPS and you are good to go simply run the program whatever you want to do run it through no Hub program am person press enter close the VPS shut down your computer wake up and see how much that process ran as simple as that secondly the location of data center is also important there are some hosting providers who do not provide CDN you might want to check for that and also there are some hosting providers where CDN locations are very limited you don't want to choose a provider who are not providing their CDN services or who are not providing services in important parts of the world the third thing I want to talk about is customer support whenever you are choosing hosting customer support is really very important you might think that I might not need customer support but whatever hosting you use customer support is very important what if you are making some mistake everything is working fine but you are just not able to figure something out and you want to know how this particular thing will happen in certain dashboard and you want to figure out how to do a certain thing in element dashboard or say some other hostings dashboard how will you do that you might want to talk to customer support and it really feels good and you will be highly satisfied while buying the hosing if you know that for me a 24/7 support is ready to answer the questions the fourth thing I want to talk about is the dashboard dashboard should be very user friendly I have seen some hosting providers who provide minimal dashboard and sometimes the important functionalities are hidden for example let us say I want to reinstall WordPress or reset my website that option will be hidden deep within some options you don't want to buy those hostings because it will take a lot of your time plus always go for Reliable hostings so that even even if you learning the dashboard you are ready to host the websites of your clients or your future websites to the same sort of Hosting now last but not the least I would like to talk about emails let us say I am buying a website called blog withth harry.com I might want to get an email address Harry blog withth har.com or support at theate blog with.com these things are really very important because email marketing and email is very important these days a lot of companies these days generates millions of dollars through email marketing so email marketing is really important and for getting email marketing to work you will need to get your email and easier it is to set up your email better it is always choose a hosting provider which is providing you the email Services Elemental hosting provides the email Services which in my opinion is a very good thing so that was all about hosting and which type of Hosting you should choose for your websites let me know in the comment section what you think about elementary hosting and do you even want to consider Elementary hosting in the future because I have mentioned my reason of choosing Elemental hosting in this video but what do you think after watching this video and which type of hosting do you think is the best I hope you found this video insightful thank you so much guys for watching this video and I will see you next [Applause] [Music] time",TRUE

not in 2023 and as we are approaching in 2024 is using Wordpress even worth your efforts or not today we are going to discuss all these things let's get into the video so I would like to start this video by discussing what exactly is WordPress WordPress is a Content management system which is based on PHP and you don't have to know how to write code in order to use WordPress now even if you are a coder I would recommend WordPress because WordPress saves a lot of time when it comes to publishing your content managing seo let us imagine a scenario where you are developing a website and you are actually writing code to develop that website now if you're using Wordpress you can save a lot of time writing code and optimizing your code then finding bugs and testing your code using Wordpress is amazing for publishing content because WordPress is made just to focus on your content you don't have to write any code all you need to do is install WordPress after choosing an appropriate hosting and you are good to go this is the reason I run my content websites on WordPress WordPress is a very old framework and it is really optimized we are recently at version six of Wordpress and version six of Wordpress is even impressive if you can use WordPress with some of the plugins then it is cherry on top of the cake because WordPress is already so powerful and installing plugins on top of that like Elementor Elementor widgets and choosing Elementor hosting in order to do all these things will save you a lot of time and efforts I'll tell you why later in this video let's discuss about what exactly is a page in Word press and what is a post the page in WordPress is just like an about page contact page which shows some information some images some videos and some static information now when you're publishing your content on WordPress you want your content to be published dynamically and incrementally as you add blog posts so let us say I'm writing a blog post on how to use JavaScript efficiently or let us say I'm writing a blog post on WordPress tutorial I can add those incrementally on a single blog page and I can manage my widgets just like the way I want using Wordpress will also save you a lot of time when it comes to SEO and optimizing your site because WordPress already has all these tools built in and you don't have to explicitly learn SEO in order to optimize your website now there is a concept of plugins in WordPress where you can enhance the functionality of your WordPress website by installing additional plugins for example Elementor is a plugin which can be used to add some beautiful widgets then Elementor also has a lot of templates built in which will save a lot of time when it comes to breiding your blog publishing your blog and growing your business typically when you are writing and Publishing content on your WordPress website you want your website to rank on Google which in turn will increase traffic to your site thereby increasing your sales or making you money in ad Revenue Now using Elementor will make your life as a WordPress developer really very easy because all you need to do is drag and drop click plus to add some widgets and you can customize your website the way you want so you should always choose proper plugins when you are building your website using WordPress now you must be thinking why can't I simply use AI to build my website why do I need WordPress you need WordPress because even WordPress is growing with AI you will have the luxury of installing element plugin and use elementer AI if you're using Elementor to host your website now this is really a big deal because you can simply give your prompts and customize your website the way you want so trust me learning WordPress is very easy and when you are choosing WordPress you get an entire built website with the theme of your choice with the color of your choice with the customization of your choice and if you are installing plugins like Elementor you can entirely customize your website the way you want now let's talk about what exactly hosting is whenever you are creating a website be it using Wordpress or be it using HTML CSS or JavaScript your clients will come to your website your server will process the information that is present let us say it will pull some data from the database or maybe it will pull some page to serve to the clients your client will then see that page code and it will pass it in the browser this is something I teach in all my web development boot camps now what is important is that there are two types of hostings one is shared hosting and the other one is dedicated hosting when you're going for shared hosting a lot of people will get the same server to serve their clients let's say there's a company a and there's a company B and there's a company C all these three companies will get the same server if they're opting for shared hosting and this hosting or say a particular computer will be provided to all those three people or say all those three companies and their clients will be served through this particular server now the problem we shared hosting is let us say your CPU goes to 100% all the clients will suffer or if your shared hosting doesn't have enough resources your clients will definitely suffer because your pay speed will go down your downtime will be increased your rankings might go down in Google hence it becomes very important for you to choose a good hosting provider one of the best hosting providers that I have encountered is Elementary hosting and I recommend Elementor hosting not just because it is good reliable and is optimized for WordPress but because it has the least down time and you get a lot of added value if you opt for elementary hosting if you are buying Elemental hosting you can get a good deal on their Pro widgets and their Pro subscription which in my opinion is cherry on the cake now element is a plugin that anywh you have to use if you are using Wordpress you cannot avoid it if you want to create a beautiful website I have element installed on all my WordPress websites and I personally recommend it to everybody be it for Designing Pages or for Designing post another reason to use Elementor hosting is that it is optimized for Elementor fidgets and Elementor is going to work the best if you've opt for Elemental hosting it is really very friendly and it allows you to create and launch a website instantly the user interface is really good and on top of that you get everything you need to build your WordPress website in a single WordPress plan you get the elemental subscription and the hosting that you anyway have to pay so my recommendation for your next WordPress website site is Elemental hosting if you want heavy discounts check out the link in the description it's fast it's safe and I have personally used it without any hassles now there is another option for hosting which is cloud hosting in Cloud hosting your provider simply provides you with some set of scalable Cloud resources let us say if your traffic goes up your RAM will increase if needed and your CPU will increase if needed your website might be data intensive and might need some graphic memory and On Demand of your client and on demand of your website's load Cloud hosting will scale itself to catter your needs now we'll go to a computer screen and we'll see an Elementor hosting in action we'll see how Elementor can be used and also I'm going to show you why Elementor hosting is best for your WordPress website so actually I wanted to show you this Elementor hosting in action basically if you buy this Elementor hosting you get the manage WordPress hosting plus the Elementor plow builder then you get the themes and on top of that Elementor has a very good support now if you are going for WordPress hosting I highly recommend this one because of the performance and reliability and the additional items that you getting with this now Elementor has 99.9% of up time with extra security built-in and they also have a CDN which means that if you have some content and you want it to be delivered to the users very fast you can do that let us say you are building your website from India and you have some users in United States some users in Canada some users in London your content will be cached in London in United States as well as in Canada now this will help help your users to access your website really very fast because your content is ready to be served in United States to the United States users in Canada to the Canadian users in London to the people living in London this way your website gets really very fast and Elementor does a really good job because they provide high-speed CDM by Cloud flare if you're not familiar with Cloud flare let me tell you that they have the top notch content delivery Network and their content delivery network is the best now they also have a staging tool which can help you push your websites to staging environment which means that uh you can try out your website now if you haven't seen my video on staging local as well as uh production environments uh I've mentioned in that video that if you have a very basic website and you want to build it you'll have to first go to your local environment and then once the development process is over you'll stage that website and once the staging is done you actually go ahead and publish that website to production staging and production environments have very similar characteristics the only difference is that you are testing your website while you're staging it and when you go to production you are actually making your website live for all the viewers so this is what the difference between all these three is now there is one more thing I want to mention about and uh it is called local WP so local WP is a software which you can install and this basically helps you with local WordPress development as you can see in this figure that uh we have created a lot of Wordpress websites and you can actually use it for free you don't have to pay for it all you you need to do is download this piece of software for free and you can actually spin as many local WordPress websites as you want I love this tool because before this tool or you can say before I knew about this tool I used to use zamp the setup was very cumbersome I used to use Apache MySQL PHP then I used to set up WordPress from scratch which was a pain I I am able to do it but the problem is that it takes a lot of time with local WP all I need to do is simply click here uh I'll stop all my sites then I'll click on Plus I can create a new site I can say continue and I can say element site and then I can continue and then once again so Elementor site is being added it will ask you to allow this piece of software uh through firewall uh let me allow this through firewall and once everything is done I will be back so it is basically asking for some Force redirection because it has to serve my website from the URL Elementor site. Lo so I can actually go to Elementor site. loal and it will open my WordPress website which is amazing now it's installing WordPress which is going to take some time so let's wait for it to install WordPress for us and then I'll be back so now Elemental site has been added as you can see so it is asking me to uh view the website as you can see we have the wp admin at place I can say root root and if you want remember the user ID and password you can check this box and then click login so as you can see we have this uh WordPress installed and uh we can simply go to plugins and add new and we can install Elementor by following these steps I'll search for Elementor I'll search for it and I'll simply click on install now and the moment I do that the Elementor plug-in will be installed the next step will be to activate the plug-in and once I've activated the plugin it will ask me to connect my WordPress to the Elementor account which I'll do and then from there I'll start using Elementor now if you are using Elementor hosting the best part is that you get to get all the Elementor Pro features for free I'm going to activate it and once I do that I can actually either skip or simply connect my account so I'll simply connect my account which I'm already locked loed into if you are not logged into your Elementor account you can simply log in and I can continue with hello theme or you can also later switch to theme Builder and start building a website using theme Builder I'll name it element a site I'll skip this one I'll start with the blank canvas or you can also browse through the templates that Elementor already have and if you are using Elementor hosting you'll have access to all these templates you can also use AI image generator and a lot of other built-in features so you can explore it and start building your website from here now not only this you can also make multiple websites and host them using local WP you can click on plus and create a new site and let us say I'll I can name it element two I'll click on continue and I can simply keep it as root and root and click on ADD site and this will actually add another element to website here and I can choose to either run it or stop it you can even run multiple websites and access them on their respective URLs and you can see the URL as element site. loal okay let me allow this which is actually a very good thing because you get the feel of a real domain instead of the local host and if you are using zamp or some other tool to set up WordPress on Local Host it is actually a lot of pain because I have personally deployed a lot of Wordpress websites and without local WP it takes a lot of time first of all secondly your setup is prone to a lot of errors and if you are a beginner and if you are stuck into something uh you might uh end up spending say 3 4 hours in fixing all those things so I hope that you understand how you can use all these tools and how Elemental hosting can actually be your Swiss army knife while you are developing website one of the best things about Elementor is that they have their kit and uh in their website kit they have a lot of designs you'll get 100 plus readymade designs which you can work seamlessly with for example let us say you want to create a blog or let us say you want to create an e-commerce website you already have built-in templates for that so this is something that I love about Elementor and if you are using Elementary hosting all this is free then on top of this you get a lot better header and Footers customization I love this type of customization because the best thing about this is that it's very intuitive plus it kind of solves a lot of problem that WordPress has when it comes to user friendliness you can change the background you can change the width you can change the layout everything is as simple as using a computer then they also have a woocommerce builder and you can edit your store with the power of element turn now if you're not familiar with vcommerce let me tell you that it is a framework to create e-commerce website with WordPress and if you use element on top of that it will really help you in your workflow now you get an extra speed not because this hosting is the best but also because you're using Elementor which is optimized for this type of Hosting your website is built using Elementor and the Elementor hosting is optimized for websites using Elementor then last but not the least Elementor AI is really powerful if you want me to build a website for you using Elementor AI let me know in the comments below and I'll show you how to create a website using Elementary AI as you can see here that you can give a prompt and and you can simply edit change or regenerate your content just like you do using chart GPT but this time you going to build websites using Elementor this is really something I love you can use generative fill you can use all those AI features which you have probably seen somewhere or the other but this time all these features will be available right into your dashboards so I hope you enjoyed this video we discussed about hosting we discussed about why WordPress is good why it is important and why creating a WordPress website can ask actually be a good idea for you if you're using Elemental hosting and Elemental widgets now if you want a video on how to create a WordPress website and to and do let me know and I'll come up with a video wherein we will discuss how to create a website step by step and then host it on Elemental thank you so much guys for watching this video and I will see you next [Applause] [Music] time [Music],TRUE

Cloud nextges 13 and all of this is going to be really very simple we are going to use Nexus 13 for keeping things simple on front-end side and apparel cloud is going to make a life easier on backhand side how all these things are going to be coordinated is something that I'm going to show you in this video let's move on to our computer screen and let's get started [Music] so apprite is a backend that can be used for your mobile apps and it can be integrated to your web app it can be integrated to anything the very first step that we are going to take in order to build this project is signing up on apprite cloud so I am going to sign up on upright Cloud you can get the link in the description and you can sign up on update Cloud by simply visiting that link let us sign in with GitHub or you can also simply click on sign up and enter these information and I'm going to use a strong password and I will register for upright loud so let's click on sign up and I will get a get the activation email so it says join our Cloud hackathon I'm going to click on go to console because I want to directly go to the console and create my first project so today I am going to create a blog project using app right load so let me call it blog and create project and this project is created now if you are familiar with something like mongodb upright Cloud follows kind of the same pattern when it comes to storing data because in mongodb we have database and then we have collections we have documents so database collection documents and in upright as well we have the database collection and documents so here you can see add a platform so they have an SDK which makes it possible for you to add different platforms for your applications you can have a flutter app which is connected to this backend this is a single backend flutter app will be connected to this backend web app will be connected to this backend Apple app will be connected to this backend and the same backend can be used to connect your Android app as well so this feature is actually great and it makes app right very easy to use plus it makes your application very easy to manage I'll show you how let's click on web app and let's connect a web app I'm going to call this next js13 because I'm going to use Nexus 13 for my blog app and I'm going to type localhost in the host name now this host name is required because you are going to use localhost to connect to this backend if you are going to use something else you can add these star.netlyphi.app or gitbot.io or virtual.app if you are planning to connect your backend from these domains but since I'm going to use localhost I'll type localhost and I'll simply click next after that I'll install apprite which is compulsory but before we continue here let's go to Google and type next js13 app I'm going to use the create next app to create my next year's 13 app I'm going to click on installation or I think I I should I should enter this let's create a new folder or let's simply open a terminal inside code playground so if you are familiar with how I work on my code base I have a folder called code playground which contains my code base and I'm opening a terminal on code playground and I will create a new Next app inside this code playground folder so let's copy this command and let's paste it and it will ask me the name of the app I'll say blog app right no I don't want to use typescript I'm going to keep the default options and this is going to install react react Dom next year still when CSS CSS Auto prefixer and I'm going to use Tailwind CSS for this project so let's simply wait and I beat it for some time and as you can see we have successfully created a project called blog upright I will simply seed into that that folder CD blog app right blog Dash upright and let me type code dot so that I have vs code open with this folder as you can see we have created this folder and the next tab that I'm going to take is opening a terminal let me open this terminal as a tab if you don't know you can use uh you can simply drag the terminal to your editor and it can be opened as a tab which in my opinion is very very convenient let's come back to this page and let's copy this and install app right so npm install app right you can either use this terminal or you can even use this terminal okay anything is fine and let's copy this and let's import line from up right I'll show you when and where this is useful but let's copy this or even if you are not planning to copy this simply click next I've copied it and I'm going to create a file and let me use this page.js let's import everything here so import line from upright and let's copy this as well and let me do one thing I want to keep this Google Chrome opened in desktop 2 and I want to open this vs code in desktop one so I can do this to switch tabs okay let's copy this client is equal to new client and this is the endpoint and this is my project ID okay let's click next and after clicking next I'll say take me to the dashboard so I'm on my dashboard which shows me what bandwidth I'm using and how many requests are made Etc okay let's click on this next year's 13 web app and I can update the host name I can delete this platform and I can do whatever I want okay there are a bunch of different options and there is this API Keys tab as well I can create an API key and I can start working uh with my backend okay so these are all the functions that can be used with the upright Cloud but let me show you very basic function firstly we are going to create a database let's create a database I'm going to call this blog let's click on Create and let's create a collection inside of blog and let's name this collection is blog as well okay now I will click on documentation and this documentation will help me add documents to the database so if you want to add a document to the database all you need to do is simply copy this I'm going to copy this or rather this let's copy this and after pasting it here I'm going to copy my project ID database ID and collection ID I'll show you where to get the project ID database ID and collection ID from so let me click backspace and databases is equal to new database let me cut this import and paste it at the top and client database ID from map right let us go back and click collection ID to copy the collection ID The Collection ID is copied let's paste it here and also let's go back and click database ID to get the database ID and let's paste the database ID here so what basically we are doing is we are creating a new document inside of our block database okay so we have a Blog database and we have a collection called blog and we are adding some documents to this so let's create an attribute so attribute key can be anything let's call it title and let's make it string yes it is required the size let us say 34 and let's click create then I'm going to create another attribute and I am going to uh sorry I'm going to create an attribute so I'll click on attributes create attribute I'll say content and let's keep the content as string and yes it is required size is one two three three okay now I can create a document like this I can say title is say I am a title and then content is I am content okay now I can start my next GS app by simply running npm run Dev and our next year's app will start so I can click on localhost 3000 and this app will start as you can see this app has started and I can reload this page and if I show you my database documents let's reload and reloading did not add any document to this database let me see what is wrong here so we have the project ID we have the document ID everything now the problem is that the current user is not authorized to perform the requested action so let's see what the problem is and the problem is that if I go to settings I have not given permission to everyone for creating reading deleting on the database so let's create a role so I'm going to say any and let's give permission for read update create and delete ideally you will not do that but again I am doing this for demonstration purpose let's now try it out and let's try to restart the server npm run Dev and let us see how this looks like so let's reload this page and I'll show you whether the documents are coming in the database or not and yes they are so if I reload this once again I'll see yet another document and so on as you can see so there is another document and there are documents being added to our blog collection because we have directly written this here so we are now ready to add content to the database okay and this is the code for doing the same so in order to create a blog I am going to create a very simple application with no authentication I'm going to Simply create a page which will show the list of all the blocks and the second thing that I'm going to show you is the page which will contain a particular blog okay so let's try to refine things a bit I am going to Simply go back to my blog collection and let's add attributes to this block so we have title we have content let's add a slug as well slug is going to be string yes it will be required and the size is going to be say 50 or 60. let's click create and let's now comment this out I'm going to comment this out because I don't want a document to be added to the database whenever I am hitting the index page let's come back to this index page and let's try to write some code inside this index page I'm going to keep things very very simple I'm not going to focus much on UI at this point but on the home page I want all the blogs to be listed so I'm going to create a state so import use state from react and I'm going to create a state and use State snippet blog set blocks is equal to an empty array okay so I'm going to keep an empty array here and let's return a div and let's type hey I want to keep things very simple at this point let's see if things are working it says that you are importing uh you are importing a component that needs used it so by default all the components are server components in next year is 13 so we'll have to see use client okay and it should work now so hey is being shown here let's come back to our public folder no I want to see where the styles are inside my apps there is a file called global.cs I want to remove all these Styles except the Tillman CSS code and it will make my page as wide I'm now going to go to tailblocks.cc and inside tlblocks.cc I am going to copy a header so I'm going to copy I header very quickly and then I'll grab a code for footer as well so let's try to add header to this page ideally you will want to use a nav bar but let me keep it very quick and since I'm demonstrating app right here I'll paste this header here let's right click change all occurrences and let's change this to class name instead of class and let's also change all these stroke Dash and I want to make the first character after straw Dash as capital so let's select this and right click command palette transform to uppercase I'm doing this because the thing is that stroke dash line cap is not valid in react so I'll have to remove this Dash and make the character right after stroke Dash as uppercase and we'll get rid of all the errors you will see some errors if you are not doing this okay but since I am doing this I will not get any errors and if I get any errors I know how to solve them all right so we have tail blocks first link second link let's see if we have some template for uh showing the block content I am simply searching for some good template for the blog content okay this looks pretty good but let's see if we can find some something better this looks good as well but I'm simply searching for something better okay so this is this is looking even better to me let's keep this on hold and let's see if we find something better than okay so this this is finals this is something that I really like let's let's turn on the word wrap view word wrap okay and after head I want to add this section and let's fix this HTML to react thing we'll have to add these slashes in order for this to work and now let's see if this is added to our app or not yes our app looks pretty good but instead of this I want to write the name of my blog let us say the name of the block is the coding Thunder and let's go to charge gbt and generate something chart GPT to the rescue and let's say generate meta description for a Blog titled the Turning sorry the coding handle okay it will generate something for me and I'm going to copy this and paste it to my app okay and yes this looks pretty good let's let's use this card as a template and let's see if we can somehow fix this so we have a single card at this point and I want to map through the blogs blogs dot map and title blogs.map and item and let's cut this and let's return this and item dot content and then item dot title and I think this should look good but again I want to do one more thing I want to make sure that blocks are populated so how do we make sure that the blocks are populated let's cut this and let's put it inside use effect snippet this is a use select snippet and I want this to run whenever this page is loaded and let's uncomment this out so we are creating a new client then I'm going to do client dot set endpoint and client dot set project let's also keep this outside the home function then we have the database then we have create document instead of doing create document I want to make sure that I promise is equal to databases dot I want to list documents list documents and let's see if we can do something so we need database ID collection ID and then query so let's add these two values and I think we should be good here yeah that should be fine let's see if let's see if we are getting this on the console so let's reload this page and let's see if we are getting this response on the console and let's see what we get on the console so it says console.log expected comma is there some issue here let me see if there is an issue here so let's reload this page and let's see if there is anything wrong here so invalid Dom property class name will fix this we'll fix this in a while and then it says can't resolve encoding okay and let's see if we are getting the result in the console or not okay we are getting this result on the console so there are some documents which we can see on the console so let's do one thing let's say that blocks is equal to response dot document so set blogs response dot documents and let's see whether we are able to see our blocks or not so yes we are able to see the blog so I am content I am content I am content let's see if we are able to add some more content and if we are able to add some more content it should be visible here so let's go back to uh app right and let's see if you are able to add some documents and uh see them here so create document I'll say enter to JavaScript and then hey this is intro to JavaScript intro to JS and let's say create and let's reload and yes we can see the central to JavaScript document here I want to make sure that the content of this page is not fully displayed here so I'll say dot sub s t r 0 to 12. so that only a part of so that only a part of this content is visible here and then we'll see we'll say some triple dots like this and this looks pretty good we can also set an image an image link or something but let's keep it for later let's now go to the internet and search for random image API random image API let's see if we can get a random image SRC is equal to random Dot imagecdn.app let's see if we can replace this with the random image we couldn't find that photo not sure why it shows this but a simple API for serving random images I think it doesn't work cdn.app let's see I'm just trying to make it work okay so images.unsplash.com this is how it is going to work let's give it a height of 23 and width of 23 generate link Okay so this is something that we can use I'm just trying to make it work let's see if it works okay so it does work but it shows the same image and how about this how about this now I will add an attribute called image let me choose attribute type as a URL and as you can see I have restarted my vs code I am going to run my server once again oops I ran the wrong command no worries I meant to run npm run Dev run Dev and let's run the development server to see how things have changed so image is an attribute and let's add image attribute to some of the documents so image is a URL so let's add URL to some image URL to images images royalty free let's see if we can get links to the images somehow let me try this one I want to keep things really very simple which is why I'm going for very simple images but ideally for your production projects you are going to go for the real images Okay so let's see if this image has a URL yes it does so let's add this and update it says invalid document structure missing required attributes log okay so let me change this to title and it's update image and let's see if we reload this whether image is pulled from the database or not it does it it is pulled from the database which means that we are able to change a document so app writes cloud.abrite dot IO dashboard can be used as a backend if you don't have a dashboard but again ideally for a bigger app you will want to have an app which has a dashboard but you can always update data from here you can update permissions from here which is an amazing feature in my opinion so let's also give this one a slug and let's give it some different image I want to change the image this time so I'll say copy image address and I will update the image address let me go back and let me do the same for other documents as well so let's grab some other image links and let's give it some random slug I know these slugs they don't look very good but ideally for your apps you are going to have very meaningful slugs so copy image address again and let's paste it here and let's call this slug 4 or something okay and let's let me use the same image for this one as well introduce Js and see it takes effect immediately so all the images are updated and this blog looks pretty good so let's change this tail blocks to coding Thunder coding Thunder Thunder and this will change to coding Thunder also you can change these links like home about us or something so you can say home and then you can say about us and then you can say contact us and so on so this is something that you can always do okay and let's say uh blog and let me keep blog above contact us and let me get rid of this button I don't know why I don't like this button okay and as you can see your navigation bar looks pretty good is there anything else that we can make to we can do to make it more better in terms of functionality the answer is yes so I'll say import link from next link now what this next link will do is instead of these anchor tags we'll use Link and we'll use hrf is equal to let us say slash and let's also change the closing tag to link okay and let's change this to about and then blog and then contact and you can create these Pages such that you can access these links so in order to create these Pages all you need to do is create folders say if I create a folder called about and if I add a react server component and the moment I click on about I'll come to this page now you can always edit and work on this page but at this point I'm not working on this page rather I'm going to work on another page which is blog post okay so right inside app folder I will create a folder called blog post and inside this blog post I will say page.js and in order to help myself with how to create a dynamic page I'll say next dot js13 Dynamic roots and I'll come to the documentation of dynamic road so since I'm using the app router not Pages router I'll change it to app router and as you can see here that I can say app slash blog Slash Slug slash ph.js so this is something that you can always do in order to get the slug so they have used the same example so inside of the blog post I will have to create yet another folder called slug and inside this slug folder I'll create this page.js and inside this page.js I can always get these values so let me see how this is going to work okay so blocks log page dot Js and these params will hold these values I guess so let's say RF refce and let's use params and let's see if params contain anything params and let's do Json dot stringify buttons and let's see what prints on the screen okay so let's let's say slash blog post slash p and I want to see if this blog post Slash Slug works or not it doesn't work for some reason okay so I misspelled blog post slug p is written here which is amazing so I can get the slug by params.slug so cons slug is equal to params dot slug and I need not do this let me open a fragment and inside of this fragment I can have the nav bar as well as a page content so let me copy this header as is ideally you will create a component for this Adder but since this is a very basic app I'm just demonstrating You by copy pasting and with a warning that you must create a component if you are trying to create header okay all right so we have this header and then I will go to tailblogs.cc tail blogs.cc okay so it says link is not defined so import link from next link this should work okay coding Thunder the nav bar is here and how should I structure my blog post is something that I am figuring out what if I show the heading here and then the content below the setting something of that sort right so without thinking much about it I'm going to copy this I'm going to Simply copy this code copy to clipboard and I'm going to paste this section and at the same time I want to remove these uh get it on Google Play and these things let me see how it looks so it looks like this and download on Play Store button SVG span so let me get rid of this Dev let's get rid of this Dev and see how it looks okay so this is going to be the title of my page and let me also see if I do lorem 23 how it looks so it's going to look like this I think this is an amazing setup for a Blog and I'm very happy with how it looks so let's do one thing let's try to pull the blog by slug from upright so I'm going to use the same Imports so let's try to use the same Imports and let's create this as a client component oops I accidentally closed it no worries and then I'm going to instead of blocks I'll say blog so I need to pull one block the first block so set blog is equal to use State and blog is going to be an object an empty object okay and inside yields effect we want to make sure that we are pulling we are pulling only the block that we need Okay so let's copy this use effect and let's tweak it let's tweak this user fact code so let me get rid of this so instead of document databases dot list documents I want to give it a filter I think I can give it a query filter and say slug should be slug and let's see what the response is so response is a lock to the console let's reload it and also I need to make sure that this is a client component so you'll have to add this use client at the top and let's see what it has to say in the console so there are some errors its client is not defined okay so client is not defined it's a very genuine error because I have not defined the client and now it should work all right so let's see what's there in the console it says 400 let me see what's wrong here 400 databases queries is equal to object plus object so this is the slug and list documents list documents let's see what are the parameters that we can provide to list documents so database ID string collection ID string and data is so we'll have to define the query like this so query is used by typing query dot equals so let's try to copy this and let's also import query from app right so we are going to import query as well so we imported query and this is not how we provide the query rather we provide the slug like this so let's make it little bigger and let's say Slug and Slug and let's see if this works okay and it says value must be a valid array and value must be a valid string and no longer there four zero nine six characters okay and the query should be an array like this so let's provide an array of queries instead of just a query so let's provide an array to this and it says index not found slug index.phone slug okay so index not found because this uh slug is not valid so let me call this title and let's see if it is able to pull something index not found slug so slug is title here and it should pull this document from the database um let's see what's wrong here so in order for this to work we'll have to create an index so let's come back to our collection and let's come back to indices and let's create an index and index type is key and the attribute we want to create index on a slug and order is ascending let's create this index and this index is successfully created and now if I reload it works so you can say total zero documents array 0 so there is no document which was pulled which is something that we'll have to look into but again this works this works at this point so slug is not equal to this params.slug value we'll have to see what is wrong here so let me try this first Slug and slug 4 and yes one document is pulled from the database so all we need is we will have to get the first document so we'll see dot documents zero so we are we are going to set the blog as response dot documents zero which is going to be your blog and then this will be block dot content blog dot content and this is going to be um and let me say block question mark dot content so that we don't get any error if blog is not defined and let's also say block dot title and let's call this as the coding Thunder okay so yes the blog is pulled from the database so if I say I am a title I am a Content this content is visible which is amazing so instead of going to the blog we'll have to go to the home page and all the blogs are visible and I will do one thing I will change the links to the valid links let me show you what this means so whenever somebody clicks on the title or on this card I'm going to add a link so let me add a link and let me say link href is equal to let's cut this and let's let's say slash blog post slash and we are going to add the slug so we'll say Plus item dot Slug and I think this should work okay so whenever I click on this title I should go to this page yes it is showing me the blog content and all of these block contents they look very basic they don't look like realistic block content but let me add a realistic blog content as well so let's let's add a blog post which actually makes sense so let's try to go to intro to JS in one blog and I don't know whose blog this is but this is whatever I'm doing is for learning purposes and it's on my local so I'm not copying anybody's blog uh let's add this title and I'm going to add the content as well so let me add this content as well and I know it is not going to be as structured as this one because I'm not using HTML or markdown or something but I pasted the content here and I'm going to give these slug as intro to Js and blog let me add blog and let's also add an image I'm going to copy this image so let's right click and I'm not able to copy this image what is it URL of this image so looks like the uploader doesn't want me to access this image but sorry developer I will anyway access your image next document security is disabled so I just clicked on Create and this blog is created so let's reload this page and let's see if we are able to access this blog or not now if you change this to mark down and if you allow more characters you can structure the blog however you want and you can also have comments and you can in a very similar way use user authentication of web right to power your blog so I hope that you like this video and now you are capable of creating a Blog using app right in a very similar way you can create your backend using app right and connect it with your Android app or anything of your choice so I think this is a great choice when it comes to creating quick blogs production applications or even apps or if you want to have everything connected to one backend and this is very useful when you want to have everything connected to a single backend like your app do the same backend and your web app to the same app right back end and so on so I hope you love this video and you will explore different ways to create different applications using upright thank you so much guys for watching this video and I will see you next time [Music] foreign [Music],TRUE

website end-to-end just using Python and in this video we are going to look at a tool which can help us build web applications by using only python you'll be able to use database you'll be able to use backend and also you'll be able to incorporate your complex logic into your python applications so let's move on to a computer screen and we'll cover all these things let's get started alright so the very first step that we are going to take is signing up on Anvil so let's move on to the computer screen and let's sign upon Anvil dot works so I'll go to anvil.works and as you can see the steps to build a website using python are written here but we want to try Anvil for free and we want to sign up first now if you don't have an envel.works account you can create one or you can simply sign in with Google I'm going to sign in with Google and let me tell you that I already have an account on animal.works because I have been using it for a while now so let's click on sign up with Google and yeah so here is an option to create a new app now from here I can create a new app and it gives me some options to create apps like it can we can create a blank app we can also create an expense approval system we can create a static website task manager a lot of other things but I want to go very basic here because I want you to understand how Anvil works so let's click on this blank app and let's start building this blank app I'll click on material design 3 because I love the design material design 3 theme with an app bar and optional left navigation menu let's select this one and our app is building and yes now we can start building our app by simply dropping a Title Here by simply dropping some links here and we can also use all these components to make our website just by using simple drag and drop how amazing is that so let's get started and let's start working on it let's change the name of our app so this is the name of our app the moment I click on M3 app one it shows me the name of my app I'll say my gym membership form and let us say we own a gym and we want to create a form for our gym members we can always do that by renaming your app to my gym membership forms so that our users or rather we as developers of this app will see the correct name okay let's choose a choose an app title I'll say my gym and let's choose an app description so I'll write my gym is the best gym in Delhi okay I'm assuming a place so let's say my gym is the best gym in Delhi we offer we offer a lot of Services blah blah blah you can always you know type an app description for your app and then you can also upload a logo let me see if I can upload an image so I have uploaded this PNG and uh I know this is not the best logo out there but I just want to show you how you can change your app logo and then you can simply save it and I think it saves on the go which means that I don't have to save it let's go back let's close and you know you can always come back here and all these things can be changed now let's see how we can create an app but before that I want to discuss why you should use Anvil now at times you want to create an app which is very basic like a very basic application which simply takes the user data and it simply dumps into the database and when you are creating such an app you will never want to set up the development environment I mean coding is great HTML is great CSS Java script everything is great even the sand will not works is made using HTML CSS JavaScript right but the thing is that sometimes it makes more sense for us to use such Services because one they can save us a lot of time secondly they are very secure because this framework is well tested and this system of building this application is well tested and thirdly if you know only python you can create complex applications using analysis not your another drag and drop UI Builder this contains backend this contains database and everything is well managed moreover you can even publish the app so this is something which is worth discussing and this is something which is worth trying which is why I'm creating this app so you can always create your complex applications using HTML CSS JavaScript or any backend like node.js but if you ever come across a situation where you have to create a simple app and you want to save your time and you want to make sure that your app is secure such kind of Builders can be a boon okay so let's now start start building the app and I'll show you how Anvil works and how we can create uis in Anvil so we have this toolbar towards the right which has all these components as you can see we have a label display text component let me drag it here and I can type anything inside the text field and that text field is going to be the placeholder so let me type enter your name enter your name and I can also change the font size so let me go ahead and change the font size icon layout let me check layout appearance and the Border background and anything uh can be changed let me find where the font size is it's here let me change the font size to 20 and let me make it bold I think it doesn't look very good when I pulled it so let me keep it as is and I can always click on run in a new tab and it will show me this enter your name let me complete this form by adding some more components I can always add this text pause let me add a text box and let me go back to this UI design and let me change the text of this text boss to something like and your name and your name and if I restart this UI will be updated which means that I can have a look at what is and will building live so this thing will be previewed here and that will be real time the moment I click on restart which is great let me add another text so let me add another display text and let me call it end your weight and once again I'm going to change the font size to 20. 20 and I think the font size of this was 20 as well align left font size 20 let's restart and see how it looks it looks pretty good and let me once again come back here and add another text box and enter your weight let's let's say enter your weight you can also change the type to number and this will be updated as input type is equal to number which is good from SEO standpoint because it can help Google in other search engines to understand what your content is about and it's always good okay so let's add some placeholder and your weight in kilograms okay let's uh try to see how our app look at this point and let's let's add another field do you need a membership discount so let's add another label so label three let me call this label as [Music] um do you need personal training and if somebody needs personal training they can always click or check the check box that I'm going to add below it okay let me change the font size to 20. and let me find out a component which I can use and the component is checkbox let's name this checkbox as let me name it as yes if you need personal training you are going to check this checkbox okay and that should be it let's see how our app looks at this point you need personal training yes you can check this checkbox awesome you can enter the name you can enter your weight in kilograms note that if you try to enter some text it is not going to work because by default we have changed the type of this field to number okay so you can only enter numbers here and let me click here and this is the uh enter your name let me change the name to placeholder because I don't want this text this is the default value of this input and this is the placeholder so I'm meant to add a placeholder so let's restart our app and this way you can start typing and you can start entering your weight and you can say yes and let me also add wheat in kgs okay and that should pretty much do for the UI but once again let me show you some other components you can always drag and drop all these components we have a file component if you are looking to create a complex application with a lot of images you can also add a custom component but at this point I'm going to drop a title here so let me call this as my gym let me let me say my gym and let me add some more links here so let's say home and then I'll drag another one and say about about look how easy it is to create a website using anvil imagine imagine if you were to create the same website using HTML CSS JavaScript Django and node.js or something else you'll have to face a lot of hassle just for creating a form even with PHP it's not that simple and with Anvil you can create it only by using python you will have an option to publish it you have an option to debug it which means you can preview it live amazing contact us and that should be good to go let's restart the app and see how it looks it looks pretty amazing at this point I want to actually change this to bold and also increase the font size to 24 and see how it looks and yes it looks good because this is a the main branding of our app this is the logo of our app and I want it to be you know pretty different from other components of the web page and I think a UI is almost done all we need to do at this point is to add a submit button so let's call this button as submit submit submit and let's align it towards the left and I think this is looking pretty clean looks pretty straightforward and you can forward this form to your friends and they will fill it now the next step is very important and the next step is to get all this data to the database and do you need a database do you need coding no you don't because Anvil comes with database you can always add a database here and I'll show you how exactly to finish this stuff so by default Android already has a database and you can always create a new database so let's add a new database so we can even use a default database okay let me use a default database and I'm going to create a new table called GM inside this database so all you need to do is type the name of the table and that should do okay let's create this table this table has been created and now you can add new column to this table so let's click on new column and let's add a text column and let's call it name and let's call this uh another column as age sorry wait we had weight and then another Boolean column let me name it as personal whether the person needs a personal training or not and let's add another text column as address now we don't have the address column yet in our app so you can always do that you will also see how easy it is to add another column okay in your database and another field in your form so let's create another field let me call this label as address address and let's change the font size to 20. font size to 20 you can even change the font and let's add a text area I'm going to add a text area at this point because text area is slightly different from input type is equal to text in a way that text area can be used uh it looks it actually looks different and you can easily type long text inside of text area Okay so you'll see how it looks all right your address so let me add a placeholder your address and let's see how it looks restart the app and this is how it looks do you need personal training yes you can always bring this below and restart your app and this drag and drop interface is amazing I really love it the text area is different from input type is equal to text in a way that this text area can be dragged like this you can drag it and keep typing and you cannot drag this thing because this is input type is equal to text if you inspect the code you will see this is input class is all this type is equal to number and this is text area if you inspect this this is a text area so these are two different HTML elements let's go back to our table and we created a table inside of our database let's click here and let's go back to our table and our database is created okay now all we need to do is come up with a way such that whenever we click on the submit button the data should go to the database and believe me that is also really very simple I'll show you how now a lot of people who are python developers they don't have a very good understanding of how websites work so let me explain how websites work first this is the front end of our website and if I right click and click on view page source and this is applicable for any website this is not annual specific concept this is web development specific concept okay so this code is HTML code and our browser is responsible for rendering this to our browser okay so whatever ever you see is a result of this code and this code has all the information to display this okay now whenever a user sees this they can always see which code is actually rendering this but they cannot see which code is generating this because a code might connect to the database the code can fetch some data connect to the database validate some credentials and after that return all this HTML all that execution is done on the backend side so a website's back end is not visible to the client what is visible to the client is the code which is used to render this and how this code is generated is done as a part of backend okay so our anvils backend is inside our Anvil application in the form of server module so we can add a server module this client code is done this is visible to everybody and our client can very well decide to right click on his browser and click view page source and see the code but what he cannot see is the server side code which we are writing and we are going to write a server side code now this code is going to execute in the Anvil server which our client will never see only we will have the access to this code so let's create a server module and in order to run this code in Anvil we need to uncomment this and use this decorator called envel.server.collable let me change the method name to submit and let's say this submit takes name weight address and personal so we'll say name we'll say we it will say address and personal and I want to say that whenever somebody clicks on the submit button please execute this and once you execute this the data will go to the database so we are going to write the code now so let me keep it as is for the time being and let's go to our app let's go to design and let's go to the submit button and I'll say that whenever somebody clicks on the submit button I want this method to be run okay so I need name name is equal to I'll say self Dot and self dot let me see what is the label for this text box one then we have text box two then we have text area one then we have check box one okay now I remember all this so let's go back to the code and name is equal to self Dot text box one this is the name and I'll say dot text okay and the second thing that I want to get is the weight I'll say weight is equal to self dot uh text box two text box to Dot and I need the text of this once again and this gives me an error okay so the error is gone and then we have address is equal to self dot text area one text area one dot text and then check is equal to self dot checks box one dot check whether it is checked or not okay now I want to execute or submit function so I'll say Anvil dot server dot call and I'll just submit call this submit and I want to give name weight address and personal okay and personal so let me call this personal and not checked so let me call this personal so name weight address and personal is passed to this submit function let's finish our server module submit function now in order to add data to the database I'll say app tables dot Jim dot add row and I'll say name is equal to name weight is equal to weight and address is equal to address and personal is equal to personal and this will add a row to a database so how how is this operating let me show you once again how all this is working together we have a database which is called gem the name of the table is Gem and these are the fields in that database okay now we have a UI which looks like this and whenever somebody clicks on the submit button this function is called right after somebody clicks on submit button this function is triggered and this function grabs the name weight address and personal these four fields and then it calls the submit button with these four values now the control goes to the server module and this function actually runs which does nothing but adds a row to our database with name weight address and personal which was entered by our user okay so it's really very simple nothing to worry about now I also want to show a notification whenever somebody submits a data so I'll say notification and then I'll say your data has been submitted your data has been submitted okay submitted and that's all I think I think we are good and let's try to restart the app and see if this work I'll say Harry 23 add do I need a personal training no I don't let's submit and it says that neem notification is not defined so the problem here is that I will have to cut this and I will have to paste it here so this notification part will be done here let me let me see if this notification is imported automatically or not so when we say from and we'll import Star this notification is automatically imported so we need not worry about it let's now once again enter value as one one one and submit and I think we are good but we didn't see any notification why so not sure let's see if there is any data in the database let's refresh and yes the data is going to the database but we don't see any notification which is a problem okay I got it why we are not seeing the notification we'll have to call the show method of the notification and there are a lot of other parameters which you can customize you can go to the Anvil docs once again animal docs are great you can always go there and you'll learn new ways of doing things and you'll learn how to create complex applications using Anvil so let's restart it once again and let's fill this form Harry and then we'll say 12 and this is my submission and let's say I need personal training so I'm going to check it submit your data has been submitted let's see if it is actually submitted or not let's refresh the table and yes it is submitted in see how this time this personal is actually being checked which means that I need personal training and this is my submission is the address amazing you can also add data to the database from here but again see how cool is this and you can also download this as CSV so it's not like you cannot take this data away download this data as CSV and you can launch this data and you can analyze this data this is really great I mean this is amazing okay so feel free to open the CSV with Ms Excel or feel free to even analyze this data using python pandas you can use matplotlab if you are a data scientist you know what I'm talking about but again this is how you can create apps using Anvil you can always come back to your form and you can change it you can explore different ways of making this more interactive you can add a sidebar here you can add a column panel which will add a sidebar here so creating UI is using Anvil is also very simple you can always come back to this page change your apps logo change your app's description and N will take scan of the SEO and I'll show you how it takes care of SEO it will add all these meta descriptions meta tags which maybe if you are creating your application in a hurry you will never do it because you will not afford to get time to do it but nville doesn't disappoints us here so in a way Anvil is something which every python developer in my opinion should know about at least another thing I like about envelope is that you can use and will to get emails whenever a form is submitted and it supports it out of the box so you can click on ADD you can click on email and you can even use a custom build server but I'm not going to use a custom mail server rather what I'm going to do is I'm going to use the built-in email service from Anvil so let's copy this code I'm going to copy this code and let's paste it here so in a server module we can always send an email and from my app support or rather I'm going to say my gym submission submission and let's change the 2 to Harry at codeword.com and let's change the subject to your form and let's create an F string and I'm going to create an app string and say a sub Mission from and I'll say name and then the weight is I'll say weight and address is I'll say address and once again and he needs personal training and person let's see if the app is sending out emails or not let's change the name to Harry and 34 Bob's address let's say yes personal training is needed and you can always code your application such that it sends the email of your choice you can create this as a variable generate a very beautiful kind of email and and will will deliver your emails so let's see if this email is delivered to my inbox or not so I just received this email and this is from manual dot app here is the submission from Harry the way to study for and the address is Bob's Edison he needs personal training true okay so this is how you can start getting emails from envel and I really love this feature from Anvil now let me know in the comment section what you would like to see what you are going to build next using and will I want all of you to tell me in the

are going to see how this module is practically used to create complex requests how you can retrieve and pass data from different web applications and process it right into your Python program this video is going to talk all about these things let's move on to our computer screen and let's get started now the very first step that you must follow in order to use request module is installation of python but I know that you will have python installed if you are watching this video so I'll go ahead and install the request module so all you need to do is type pip3 install requests okay now a lot of people will face some issues if they are on Windows if they type pip install request so I always recommend use pip 3 because pip 3 will directly install it I already have this module installed which is why it is showing me requirement already satisfied I'll fire my pycharm CE which is an IDE it's one of the best Ides for Python and I'm I'm going to create a new project and let me name this project as requests module and I'm going to use Python 3.11 previously configured interpreter you can you know simply go for system interpreter and click on create once you click on create you will see this screen pycham will give you the starter code I however don't need this starter code so why should we use request module at the first place if you are trying to automate something if you are trying to do something with python which involves Network requests you can always do the same using request module in python or let us say you want to scrape some data and you want all that data to be written to a CSV file or maybe to a database you can always do that by using request module the very simple usage of request module is you import request module and simply do request dot get before I get further in this video I want to let you know that I have teamed up with IP Royal to bring you a very special coupon code of 30 off their Royal residential proxies make sure to try them out before the offer expires so there are countless of reasons why a business must be interested in doing some data scraping one of the very common use cases is bringing all the data from different places to one place and doing analysis on top of that data efficient and accurate web scripting is not possible without the help of what residential proxies picking the right proxy solution will help you get the data from the right sources in right amount of time which can further help your business IPL provides a constant stream of fresh IPS for all sorts of web crawling projects being able to routinely replace your IP addresses with new one anywhere in the world makes your greater Gathering efforts indistinguishable from genuine visitors IPL has a massive pool of residential IEPs which you can always use to do web scrubbing and speed up your data collection the best part about IP Royal is that this support is available 24 7 which is a plus so you can use the code Harry during checkout and you will get 30 discount on IP Royal make sure to check it out in order to get started with the request module we'll make a very simple get request to google.com if you go to google.com this is what you see but this is not exactly what browser retrieves if you go to view page Source you'll see this this is the source code of this page if I come back to my python IDE I can always do requests.get and I can give this URL which is google.com and then I can print r dot text now what is our RS what is returned by request.get if you print r dot text you can run this and you will get the source code of this page this was the very basic web scrubbing which you can possibly do now let me come back to my Google Chrome and show you some more use cases so if I Google search requests you can go to request documentation HTTP for humans this is how requests documentation looks like so let us say I have this R is equal to request dot get and I want to authenticate with GitHub API or let me show you another API Json placeholder now this is a sample API which we can use to test or get requests let me copy this URL this is simply sending a get request to the server if I do the same thing with I'll right click and click on soft wrap so that I don't see the horizontal scroll bar as you can see this returns this which means that this data is being returned from the server now what is the type of this data let us check and the type of data let me tell you is going to be a string which means that you will have to pass it as Json if you want to use it as Json or python dictionary okay all right so far so good let us now try to explore more about request module if you come to the request modules documentation the best page about request module is a quick start this is the quick start page which we want to explore and we'll be exploring the topics one by one from this quick start page if you scroll down you'll see everything is written on this quick start page for you to get started with request module for example I can make this basic request let me copy this let me paste it here and if I do this and if I print r dot text you'll see that oops I'm actually printing the type of this I want to get the data this is what I get now if I control click which means if I try to see the data on my browser I'll see this this is what it returns okay so this is the quick start page which I recommend you have a look at and understand how request module Works should you have any doubt you can always come back to this page and this page will most probably have answer to your question now if you want to add some request parameters to your get request for example let us say I want to visit this URL but programmatically let me show you something if I copy paste this this is what it returns now HTTP bin.org is a very interesting website let me tell you what it returns is your request as it is which means that you can test your request it can be a post request it can be a put request as you can see here is a documentation of this HTTP bin.org you can always test different methods you can go to http window.org delete all these are different type of requests delete is used to delete something get is used to fetch some data patch is used to send patches post is used to send post parameters if you have a lot of data you want to post something then put is used to create something on the server you can always use all these methods in this case we used slash get and we pass this key is equal to Value I can always pass more parameters by saying Harry is equal to good and as you can see key Val is there in arcs if I visit this URL Harry good is also there in aux which means that whenever I'm adding query parameters to my get request they'll be visible here let's try this using uh python okay now one argument that you might have is why can't we do something like this like simply send this request and paste the oops I click the wrong button I meant to click the Run button okay as you can see that Harry Gordon key Val is there but what if these parameters are Dynamic you can always use f strings but there is another way to do this you can say R is equal to request dot get and then you can add this payload let me add this payload and I'll say params is equal to payload so let's add this payload comma params is equal to payload now if I run this program you'll see that value 1 and value 2 all these payload parameters are present in the response okay so this is how you can send get request with parameters using request module now let's try to send a post request with some data okay so instead of saying request dot get will do request dot post and let me tell you how to send the data you can always say data is equal to your data and your data will be posted to the server you must be thinking that why am I sending the request to the same website HTTP bin.org STD build.org post is simply simulating an endpoint which accepts post request okay params is equal to payload I'll say data is equal to payload this time okay but let me do something so that we also Preserve the code because I have to give you the code by the end of this video okay but you can always take the code from the quick start guide so that should not be a problem okay R is equal to request dot post http.org post data is equal to payload let's see what r dot text returns auto text will return this form and this will tell me that hey you have actually given me a post request the type of this request is post and this is the data that I received okay you can always use an actual server here let me tell you once again and you can use data is equal to your payload whatever you want to send to the server and that should be able to post your data to that server endpoint okay so this is how you send a post request you can always add more parameters to this payload and you can always generate these payloads dynamically now let's see how we can use other type of requests so there are a lot of different type of requests like a get request is one post request is one put request is one delete request is one head request is one so all these requires have different use cases you can always do request.port delete head options and you should be able to get the required data let me know one thing let me copy all this code and if I paste it here I'll show you all these one by one let me comment all these first let me show you the put request if I run this you'll see that this is actually going through and asks this data this files is the put request is going through and you can try a bunch of other request types that should work okay another important use cases of request module is downloading files it's very easy to download files using requests let me show you how so if I press enter let me create a new python file because this one is getting very bloated so let me see R files.py and let's print this now for this you'll have to install pillow module I'll come to terminal pip 3 install pillow which is a module and this will install pillow module awesome so this is installing pillow module okay nice now we can download an image I'll show you how to download image so if you want to download an image you can say import request first and let me move this towards the top and R is equal to request dot get the URL to the image let's see if we can find an image from the Internet oops image image yes I want this image open link open image in new tab I'll copy the link to this image okay images Dot and splash.com let's see if I can get the data and let's run this program so the moment I run this program I'll have to actually right click and run this program because I'm on pycharm SO the moment I run this program I can open an image now to save this image I'll say FP is equal to open and let us say image.jpg and let's write it as bytes and now I can say I dot save FP and this should be able to save this file so as you can see image.jpg is saved here so I can use request module to download images from the internet okay so this is how you can download images from the internet you can also download files in a very similar Manner and any file type will work if you want to download it another interesting use case is to stream the files what does streaming means let's say we have a large file and we want to download it part by part how do we do that let me take you to jetbrain spy charm website pycharm let me download python oops I wanted to download pycharm okay let me copy the link to this download or let me simply click here and this this should generate uh a pH it will allow me to download it let me copy this link copy link address I'll cancel this download I already have pie charm let's try to stream the file let me read a new file called stream file dot py this will create this will simply create a file and I should be able to let me soft wrap it just so that I can show you what I'm typing import requests so in order to stream all you need to do is say R is equal to request dot get say URL and then stream is equal to true now you are streaming the file instead of actually downloading it if you come back to the documentation of request you'll see that you can say R is equal to request dot get stream is equal to true and you can start reading the content of that URL okay now in order to download it part by part you can also specify a chunk size which is in bytes and in this case you can see that the chunk size is 128 byte you can always change it to your liking and I'm going to say by charm.dmg as the file name and I'm writing the content as binary and the chunk size is 128 okay now let me do one thing I'll print I'll say print I uh let me say I am downloading I am downloading part number let me write an F string here let's say I I okay I is equal to 0 and we are going to enumerate uh sorry we are going to say I is equal to I plus 1 and and I know that I have to put this inside the loop okay right after ft dot right all right this should work so we are opening a file called pycharm.dmg we are writing it and we are specifying a chunk size of 128 let's run it so as you can see that it is actually downloading it part by part part by part part by part and definitely this print statement will take a lot of time but let me comment this so that this can happen peacefully but let me cancel it because this is a very huge file I guess and will take a lot of time for it to download it let me delete this file first of all and delete anyway I want to delete it and let me run this program and I'll wait for this file to rather this program to fully execute and then I'll be back all right so I just downloaded this file and as you can see that python.dmg is here let's try to execute it and let's see if we can actually execute it let me right click here now I can right click this file open in finder okay and I can double click this file and as you can see that this is downloaded successfully now the another question that a lot of you might have is how do I exactly know the size the total size of this file you can always print r dot headers let me do print r dot headers and it's not download the content let's just do r dot headers and let's comment this out and let's see how it goes so if I say r dot head you can see that we have this content length header I can say r dot headers content length and this should give me the length of this file okay okay so now I'm going to create a downloader which will tell me what percent of this file is actually downloaded so let's see how it goes okay so let me create a variable called total and total is going to be the total bytes and now what I'll do is I'll say uh total is equal to Total plus length of length of what length of Chunk and let me place this line here okay so this will add it to the total and after every iteration I will print an F string and I'll say uh total out of uh or rather let me say total expected is equal to this this is the expected total amount of bytes that we are expecting to receive and this is the total amount of bytes actually received and this much out of this much received or rather we can even say this much divided by total expected multiply by 100 multiplied by this divided by this percent of total expected divided by thousand uh which will create it to uh okay so one byte megabytes okay so MB received all right fingers crossed okay so it says that total expected um unsupported operands for n ten string so what is and and what is string okay so this is a string that's interesting we'll have to convert it to an integer okay so let's run it and it says one percent receive two percent received four percent received five percent received I'll have to round it actually it's not looking very good but yeah we just made a downloader which actually keeps track of the progs amazing man amazing let me cancel this and I'll show you something I'll show you something um there is a package called TQ DM in Python very interesting TQ DM and tqdm is I hope I've spelled it correct I used a long bag actually so all you need to do is PIP install PQ DM oops three installed PQ DMT qdm oops uh I'll say windows a and pip 3 and TQ DM they should install it oops I already have tqdm wow amazing amazing man from dqdm import dqdm and all I need to do is do TQ DM of whatever I want okay let's try this this is actually amazing and I'll show you what it does just wait for a bit uh for Chunk in this and let's not print anything and see the magic so you can see that it is showing me how many iterations have finished and how much time it is expecting or rather how much time has passed since it started running or it's honestly speaking I was facing some issues with tqdm but this stack Overflow answer saved me okay so I'll not discuss a lot about this I'll simply link the stack Overflow answers somewhere here and this should help you okay so what I did was I said with tqdm total is equal to Total expected divided by 128 why did I do this because this is the number of times my for Loop is going to run as P bar and then I'm doing P bar dot update let me see what what happens if I don't do p bar uh dot update if I do this this will show up like this but I don't want it to show up like this I want it to show up like this like this okay and this looks pretty good as you can see that it is showing me the percentage seven percent downloaded eight percent downloaded nine percent downloaded amazing so this is how you can actually create a downloader which shows you progress in Python okay amazing this is pretty interesting now I'll stop this and I hope that you understood how to create a downloader using python request now let's see how we can use proxies with request so I'm going to create a new file called proxy let me get a new file called proxy test always make sure that the file you are creating is not the name of any built-in module or any kind of module because that might hamper the way your python script is running and we don't want it let me import requests or rather let me come back to this website and let me go to the request documentations once again and let's see how we can use uh proxy with request so I'm going to search for proxy let me see how okay so we have proxy support okay let me Google search it requests proxy and I got some stack Overflow answers and yes this is how you use proxy with request so it's pretty simple and straightforward I think this should be there in documentation as well I'm not sure where it is but again we just found it and I'm glad I found it okay so I'm going to import request import request HTTP proxy https proxy and I'm going I'm going to use these both proxies and let me hard code them let me remove this and I'm going to hard code them okay this is going to be my HTTP proxy and this is going to be my https proxies I'm I'm going to replace it with my actual proxy and I'm not going to use any header and let me Google search some way to find my IP IP address IP address API yes IP address API I want to see what my IP address is okay so they have some plans API Dot ipi5.org okay and ipapi.com let me see how this looks ipapi.com query so if you give IP address to them they are going to send back you these details I want to visit this okay this is free which is amazing so let's see how we can directly get the IP address IPI 64 Dot ipify.com will give me an IP address let me send the request here and let's print r dot text now where do we get the proxy from I'm going to use IP Royal so let me open IP Royal IP Royal and let me open IP Royal and let me log into my IP Royal account so I just logged into my IP Royal account I'll come to dashboard and let's see where we can use the proxies I'll come to Royal residential proxy I have 4.98 GBS in my account so I'm going to Simply copy one of the bloxies and I'll copy this and I'm going to paste it here okay let me use this command first because I want to see what this command will return enter and yes it is returning me something let me make a little bit bigger and show it to you you can see that the state is California and countries us amazing everything is good so let me do one thing let me find a format which will work with python username colon password at the rate hostname colon Port works with python so I'm going to copy this let me copy and also I'm going to paste it here like this http colon double slash and I'm going to try it I'm going to click right click and run and it says host API 64.ipi5.org this is uh not working let me see what's wrong let me also specify https proxy because https proxy was wrong let me now run this program and again I see an error one thing that I got to know about IP Royal was that they use their proxy on HTTP which means that https proxy will also be HTTP and if I run this program now this should return me the IP uh okay so this is returning me this should return me the IP alright so it gave me this IP address let me see what this IP address is about you can also use this in Python by sending a request but again I'm going to test it right inside my browser okay so it says fail SSL unavailable for the endpoint members.ipi.com okay so let me check it somewhere else uh check IP I think we'll have to get some API key from here uh you know to check other IPS but again let me simply look up this IP address here get IP details yes so this is an IP from France State Paris sorry City Paris State I led France all right so IP is working sorry proxy is working okay so this is how you use proxy in Python now I'll tell you about how you can do web scraping and take your request knowledge further I'm going to show you that now in order to scrape a website you will have to first get the HTML code of that website and that will be done using request module just like we saw now let me go to um PS4 module and this will give me beautiful soups documentation now what is beautiful soup let me tell you if you type pep ins oops pip 3 install bs4 this will install a module called Beautiful soap now beautiful soup is a web scrubbing model it is used for web scrubbing I'll show you how let's say I want to scrape a website and let's say this is the website that I want to scrape iproil.com IP royal.com let's say I want to scrape this website royal.com okay 100 transparent proxy Service uh let's copy this first and I'm going to use the same page because I want to use random IP address to scrub this webpage okay let me replace this with or rather let me not replace it but let me create a copy of this and comment the previous request dot get call https ipl.com r dot text let me write it to an HTML file okay so I'll say with open and index dot HTML I'm going to write it and I'll say as F and F dot write r dot text okay let's run it all right so I just copied and pasted this and as you can see I just got a file here called index.html so I just entered a URL called https codeword.com and I'm using these proxies let me run this and as you can see index.html file is created here and I expect the content of codeweathery.com to be there on this website let us say I want to get this this particular text I'll right click I'll click on inspect and as you can see that this is a paragraph and which class is this let me find a class this is the class mt2 and what else is there to uniquely targeted I'm going to copy and I'll copy full X path of this element okay now as you can see index.html has the website content now in order to scrap data from bs4 model what we do is we say from bs4 import Beautiful soap and we create a soup now soup means a soup of a web page so beautiful soup Works on the concept of soup soup means that you have a web page and you are converting it to a beautiful soup object so I'll say soup is equal to beautiful soup and I'm going to say r dot text and I'm going to say HTML dot parser okay and let me find out all the links I'll say for a or other uh for Link in a soup dot find all find all and I'm going to find all a and I'm going to print link okay now why did we do this why did we write it to a file because at times when I'm doing web scrubbing what I do is I write all the content I scrape all the content first write it write all the content to the files and then I go ahead with uh you know the actual web scrubbing because once I have the content I can do anything with that content I need the proxy just to get all the content so as you can see that we have this this this all the links of the page and we can also say print link dot href because we might at times be interested in just the link okay so you can see that it is getting oops it says link dot href is none so I'll say find attribute or rather uh link dot get attribute yeah this should this should do link dot get attribute and href not sure if this is going to work but let's see I want to search for it you know there's no shame in searching for something how to get attribute in PS4 and as you can see that somebody has said you can use dot get method dot get okay let me use dot get let's wait for this to finish first okay so this did not work let's see if link dot get works or not I'm waiting for it let's see what happens all right so as you can see that I got all the links from codeweathery.com so this is how you can scrape specific content from a particular website in this case I scraped all the links from beautiful soup.com sorry codeweathery.com using Beautiful soap now I will go to beautiful soups documentation and we'll see how you can learn Beautiful soap BS for dogs and bs4 docs are very nice you can go to the beautiful soup documentation and you will find how you can use beautiful soup to get the page title to get a particular tag just like we scraped all the links from the page you can always scrape specific part or parts of a web page okay so you can definitely explore beautiful so but let me know if you want a dedicated tutorial on Beautiful soap I'll create that as well I hope that you like this video if you did let me know in the comments and if you want the beautiful soup tutorial let me know that as well now before I wrap up the video I would like to show you how you can apply the coupon code to get the discount so I've entered my credentials I'll solve the captcha and I'll log into my account the next thing you want to do is click on Royal residential proxies and simply click on create new order and if you apply the coupon code Harry and click on apply you are going to get flat 30 discount as you can see the message coupon was applied has been flashed on the screen giving you a total of 30 discount so go ahead and if you you want to purchase the proxy make sure to use the coupon code Harry so I hope you understood how the quest module can be used to get the data make a post request or different type of requests and how you can do streaming of files using request on python also we saw how you can perform web scrapping using Python and request using beautiful soup that was all about this video thank you so much guys for watching this video and I will see you next time foreign [Music],TRUE

JavaScript and we are going to use Rapid API extension and Rapid API to create this let's move on our computer screen and let's see how these things are created and let's get started so now I inside of my vs code and what I'm going to do is I I'm going to open my Chrome browser and here is an API called dictionary by API ninja so if you go to Rapid API and sign up for an API you can actually search for an API so you can search for an API in the search bar so what I'm doing is I'm typing word dictionary and this will actually pull all the apis related to this keyword and as you can see that word dictionary is an API dictionary by API ninjas is an API this is something that you can use this is something you can use as well so let me open this dictionary by API ninjas and what this is doing is basically it can uh help you get meaning of a word using AXS fetch or whatever you like okay now what I'm going to do is I'm going to create a folder in vs code so I'm going to create a folder uh called dictionary pwh and I'm going to drag this folder to vs code so I'm basically dragging this folder to vs code and I want you to install two extensions in vs code the first one being the rapid API which is from Rapid API itself it's a rapid API client extension basically you can test your um apis using this extension install this and you're going to love it trust me okay now uh another one is live server this is something that you need to install as well this is also amazing uh and it basically helps you get the um you know output preview of your HTML files and you can actually you know see the live preview without having to reload the page so we are going to use this for sure let me create a new file called index.html here no rocket science so far so far okay uh it's really very cold guys so if I'm typing slow that is the reason okay get bootstrap.css permanent so I always use bootstrap I don't know why the reason is actually I know the reason is that not a lot of people are very comfortable with with CSS and if you are teaching something which is not CSS for example here I want to teach you how to use apis I want to write some JavaScript code I don't want to focus on front end so what I'll do is I'll actually use something which doesn't consume a lot of your attention uh from front end point of view okay so what I'll do is I'll use this bootstrap so the very first thing that I'm going to do is I'm going to grab this uh quick start template from bootstrap and let me simply paste it here and let me right click and open this with live server so bootstrap is working and it's very easy to make bootstrap work no rocket science there and I'm not pretending that I've done something which is great so far okay now what I'm going to do is I'm going to grab a nav bar a very easy way to grab a nav bar is to copy it from here and paste it here now this is something which is permanent on CW and BW as well we always use bootst you always use this now bar because it is easy to use okay let me change the title to Dictionary app because I want to I want to feel the CL Dictionary app while I'm using this app let me also copy this and let me paste it here and you'll see that I I without having to reload the page you'll see the title of the page here okay which is great now what I'll do is I'll simply type something here and I want the meaning of that word here okay so what I'll do is I'll create a very simple layout in fact what I'll do is I'll grab a layout from the examples what could be the best way to to get the um you know meaning of a word uh I think this is something which is great so what I'll do is I'll simply right click and inspect and let me copy this entire thing with with the heading with the image let me see if I can do that uh so what I'll do is oh let me do one thing guys let me no no no I don't want to grab the entire main uh because that will complicate the things for me so what I'll do is I'll say edit HTML and I already have the bootstrap in installed so here inside of this div I'm pasting this div and you'll see that centered hero is something that I've grabbed automatically this is like you know uh very easy to do now I I'll show you something I'll show you something so you can actually use bootstrap icons okay I don't know if I'm uh going out of context here but bootstrap icons is an amazing way to grap some of the very nice icon from the internet I don't know if you can directly download them um but uh I I'll see if I can download the book icon you know somehow so this is the d uh icons I think these are all the icons let me see if they have book oh yes they do they do have books um let me see if I can download it open image in new tab can I reference to this let me see if I can do that uh what I'll do is I'll simply replace this SRC with this one I should be able to use the GitHub server let me see where is my app here is my app oh wow this is actually looking great so all I need to do now is I type a Word here I'll click search and upon clicking search after typing a word I want to see the meaning of that word here okay uh so I I'll change the content of these two buttons uh talk to author contribute so these are the two buttons two dummy buttons which I'm creating for this app and uh guys it's really very cold here I I'm going out of context but I'm doing this sorry about that okay I don't want to waste a lot of time doing this so I'll continue so what I'm doing is I'm adding these two buttons and I'm adding these two buttons so that you know uh the app looks good okay now what I'll do is I'll simply grab the Windows key on my keyboard actually I'm using a Windows keyboard on a Mac uh I don't know if if that's normal but I do that because I have a Windows machine and you know I have to switch from Windows to Mac I have a keyboard and I love this keyboard it's uh I'm again going out of context it's from Red Gear uh mechanical keyboard really nice not sponsored by the way okay so let me mouse is from Logitech it's also good uh let me now do something let me now come back to vs code and let me create a script called script.js and inside of this script.js what I'll say is I'll say hey if somebody clicks this button which button this search button okay so I'll say uh ID is equal to search I'll say hey if somebody clicks on the search button all you have to do is you have to grab the text from this input so I'll simply say ID is equal to search input so I have a search input here and I have uh another element with ID search let me call it search ptn you know it'll be easy for me to remember what this is otherwise if I simply say search I'll forget that it's a button and it's not an input Okay cool so far so good now what I want to do is I want to actually you know I want to see if this API works so what I'm going to do is I'm going to test this API right into the rapid API extension so let me do one thing let me simply take this URL so this is a dictionary and I'll give it a parameter which is word okay so let me um let me say new request let me put the URL here so it's a get request I'll say dictionary dictionary app by API ninja so API ninja is the provider in Rapid API so in Rapid API you have a lot of providers who are providing the API to you uh I'm using rapid apis API ninja okay so thank you API Ninja for the API so query in place of query what I'll do is I'll say word and I'll say abandon I I'll see the meaning of this word but let me add the headers first so I'll copy this key I'll you know paste my key then I'll paste the host so these are the two headers which I'll have to copy and paste how do I know that because that's something which I'm seeing in this XS code you can actually change this code if you want you know if you don't understand JavaScript and XCS you can actually change this to some other language so uh if you want to change it to lipc URL code you can do that okay so you can always do that okay now what I'm going to do is I'm going to keep JavaScript fetch because I'm going to use fetch I can actually copy this code right from I don't even have to test it but in case you are using a third- party API provider which is not providing you a means to test the API you can actually test it here so you can see that to cast or drive out to banish to expel to reject so this is something uh API ninja has returned and I love it I can actually show the definition here so all I'll do is I'll say hey um let me write a function and I'll say um the name of the word is dictionary and I'm going to write an arrow function I'm going to say hey if somebody gives me a word okay if somebody gives me a word and uh if if I need the meaning of that word what I'll do is I'll call this API and I'll actually convert this then to a proper function um and inside of this function I'll write the logic so I'll actually get the response in the console and I can do whatever I want here so I can say search uh BTN or rather search uh or or let me call it word do inner HTML is equal to response Dot and we have the word response. word so what I'm basically doing is I'm saying that uh inside of span with ID word what you'll have to do is insert this text okay so let me create a span with ID word so this is where I want my word to be so I'll say span and I'll say ID is equal to word okay and here what I'll do is let me toggle word wrap yes uh here what I want is I want the definition so I'll say span ID is equal to definition okay so uh word. HTML is equal to this and definition do HTML is equal to response. definition which means this thing and the moment somebody searches uh what I want to do is I want to say hey uh if somebody clicks on submit BTN I want to add an event listener and I want to add a click listener and what I want to do is I want to say hey if somebody clicks on this button all you have to do is e do prevent default now what is e do prevent default so basically when somebody clicks on the button and it's inside of a form that form will be submitted I don't want that I don't want page to reload and form to submit I want to suppress the default Behavior okay so this is what e do prevent default does after this what I'm going to do is I'm going to say hey if somebody clicks on this button do one thing grab the value of this input and call the dictionary function so I'll say dictionary and searge input. Val so grab the value of the search input and execute this stationary method okay uh and by default what I'll do is word your word will appear here and in place of definition I'll say welcome to the dictionary app type your favorite word in the search bar at the top search bar at the top and you will see the meanings here okay you will see the meanings here which is great okay so let me see if the app works your word will appear here welcome to the dictionary app type your favorite word in the search bar at the top at the top left left sorry top right at the top right and you will see the meaning of that word here you'll see the meaning of that word here you'll see the meaning of that word here let me try so I'll say abandon uh it didn't work there is some error or something let me see what the issue is so I think I forgot to add this script so what I'll do is I'll say script script is script SRC is equal to script.js and submit BTN is not defined submit BTN where are you search bdn sorry not submit bdn so search bdn it's called search bdn not submit bdan uh so if I say abandon so if I search for abandon let me see if this works it doesn't work it doesn't changes this and C bright let me see if the word is bright no it's it's actually taking the wrong word so what I'll do is I will see why is it taking bright the reason is that we have hardcoded bright so what I'll do is I will say word here so whatever is coming will appear here and word do inner HTML is equal to response. word so the span with ID is equal to word is not changing so this is something that I need to fix so your your word will appear here so why is ID is equal to word not working so word do inner HTML is equal to response. word let me see why the word is not changing so if I say abandon the meaning of abandon will come but this word is not changing so to cast or driver to banish to expel this is this is this thing okay cool nice now uh why is this word not taking this place let me see let me type word here so this is correct if I say word do inner HTML is equal to response. word sorry if I say hey it changes to hey but why is it not working here so if I say word do inner HTML is equal to response. word why is the word not changing let me see what's the issue here so word your word will appear here span ID is equal to word not sure man what's happening but I will find out the bug so the meaning is changing but this is not changing what's wrong here what am I doing wrong here so w r d w r d meaning is correct everything is correct this this thing is actually you know it's it's actually freaking me out let me do console.log word and response and let me remove this response from here let me see if the word is available or not while I'm typing something so if I type abandon so abandon is here but why is this thing not showing up this word okay I got it I got it so I'm what I'm doing is the mistake is that I'm using the same word here but I'm I should actually use some other ID so I'll say a word heading okay let me call it word heading instead of word and no need to do console log I'm pretty confident that this is going to work okay so word heading. HTML is equal to response. what now if I do something like this what I'll do is I'll save water let me see what the meaning of water so if I search the fluid which descends from the clouds in Rain what a nice definition and also I want to format the output nicely so how do I do it so the first second and third uh so what I'll do is I'll say hey if there is one dot in your word response. word I'll say do replace replace one dot with uh back sln word dot sorry one dot back back slash and it's actually a forward slash not back slash okay and I want to do this with two Dot and three dot okay let me copy this let me paste it here 1 dot 2 Dot 3 Dot 4 dot let me also do the same thing with four dot and we'll see if this works or not so if I say abandon this will actually change okay so I I don't want uh back sln I want uh BR because this is HTML br will work in HTML so if I say abandon if I say search uh okay so BR doesn't work why let me find out so if I do uh response. word do oh I'm doing it with word I need to do it with the definition so this is a mistake let me fix my mistake this should work now if I say abandon and if I search this is actually showing all the meanings in new lines nice nice and clean this looks pretty pretty good okay uh meaning of your word will appear here I'll say meaning of if I do something like this this is actually not looking good so let me change it to here is the meaning of plus response. word and let me enclose this in double quotes So I searched here's a meaning of water and let me also put a space here so abandon let me also see the meaning of um let me see the meaning of uh pressure so here's the meaning of pressure let me see the meaning of um what is specs this is the meaning of specs it's not available is specification let me see if the meaning of specification is available it is available so this is the meaning and word which is being displayed here you can always beautify this or you can always show the first meaning it's up to you guys you can you can do whatever you want if you know JavaScript you you can do literally whatever you want I can actually go to index.html and make it the Nar a pretty more beautiful so I can remove this Li let me remove this Li let me change it to about this this app and you can even change the HFS you can remove this disabled link and yes this works now and this is looking pretty good so I hope that you like this Dictionary app if you have any questions let me know in the comments and um it's pretty cold here so let me remove this I look good uh This Way U thank you so much guys for watching this video and I will see you next time [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music],TRUE

This course is also available in the Hindi Language on  @CodeWithHarry   channel. JavaScript often abbreviated JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2022, 98% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for web page behavior,  often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.
JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard. It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).

The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.

JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but are now core components of some servers and a variety of applications. The most popular runtime system for this usage is Node.js.

Although Java and JavaScript are similar in name, syntax, and respective standard libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.
JavaScript is the world's most popular programming language.
JavaScript is the programming language of the Web.
JavaScript is easy to learn.

explain you what expressions in javascript are for instance when you are writing 7 plus 5 is equal to 12 7 and 5 are operands plus is operator and 12 is the result we are going to understand all these basics in this video and also we are going to see the types of operators which are present in javascript expression in javascript on the other hand is a value which can be given to either a variable or a constant or it can even be returned from a function which we are going to see in the later videos when i say not of true not is an operator true is an operand and the result of not of true is going to be false and false is a result which explains that operands need not be two in number they can even be one in number you can even have one operator one operand in one result not of true is equal to false is a classic example of that when i say something like seven semicolon or even if i say not of true semicolon that in itself is a valid javascript program a lot of people get confused with this but this is a valid javascript program we are not assigning it to any variable we are not doing anything extra but not of true is equal to false semicolon or seven semicolon is a valid javascript program we'll now go to a computer screen and see how these concepts are useful in javascript and i'm going to create programs for you explaining all of these concepts very clearly let's get started [Music] [Applause] so with this video we are going to start operators and expressions which is going to be your chapter number two so let me open the pdf of chapter number two and we are then going to see in detail what chapter number two has to offer for us so let me also open this thing in vs code so that you can see uh where i'm making the programs and also i'm going to say zero one underscore operators underscore expressions.js okay so let's go to chapter number two and let's try to understand what chapter number two has to tell us okay so a fragment of code that produces a value is called an expression so if i if i say seven semicolon or eight semicolon this is a code which actually is a valid javascript program i'll tell you why so this is simply an expression okay if i say false this program does nothing at all but this is a valid javascript program let me tell you if i run this you'll see nothing happens but this is a valid javascript programs you see nothing happening but also you don't see any error which means this is a valid javascript program okay so what is basically happening here is we are simply writing a literal okay but we want our programs to do something because the purpose of our program is going to be something we want a program to do something for us so every value written literally is an expression so this is an expression but if we operate two expressions using an operator so basically if i say 8 plus 9 is equal to we can make javascript do this i'll explain you what operators are now so there are different types of operators in javascript one of the operators is arithmetic operators and we have assignment operators and we have comparison operators and then we have logical operators as well so let's do one thing let's try to understand arithmetic operators so let me say arithmetic operators and let me also do something like this a plus b is equal to and i'm going to say a plus b okay also i'm going to say let a is equal to 4 and let b is equal to 7 okay so 7 plus 4 is going to be 11 okay also i'm going to use different types of operators different types of arithmetic operators on these two numbers so if i do something like this let me change this to 14 okay let me change this to 15 actually so if i change this to 15 and let me change this to 3 or maybe 2 if i save you'll see that a plus b is 17 15 plus 2 is 17 a minus b is 13 a multiplied by b is 30 and a divided by b is 7.5 this is something that you should note in languages like c when we divide 15 by 2 you get 7 you don't get anything in decimal the result is also an integer the operation between an integer and integer is an integer in c language but not in javascript javascript is going to tell you exactly the value of this expression as you can see here okay now let's talk about another operator which is the modulo operator so if i do something like this a person b and if i run this you'll see that a person b is equal to 1. so this is basically telling me the remainder when we divide 15 by two this is a remainder one is the remainder if you change these numbers you are going to see something else okay i am also going to add two more things i am going to say a is equal to and b is equal to so that in the output itself you can see the value of a and b okay so if i do something like this you'll see a is equal to 15 b is equal to a plus b is there c minus b is this and so on okay now there are two more operators that i want to tell you so star star is the exponentiation operator okay so if i do something like this if i say a star star b this is actually an exponentiation exponentiation operator okay this is basically raising a to the power of b so 15 square which is going to be 225 as you can see okay so this is how this works and i hope that you are getting how all these things are working so what i'm going to do now is i'm going to explain you two operators which are plus plus and minus minus plus plus and minus minus are actually assignment operators as well as arithmetic operators because they are performing both the actions so now let me show you how these work and this is really going to be very very helpful for you for your future javascript journey if you understand how plus plus operator works so a lot of people must be thinking that why am i teaching so basic why am i not telling you the exact thing uh why am i not going to the promises call backs all the difficult stuff in javascript because this is the ultimate javascript course and this is meant for beginners okay so don't expect me to just dive into the difficult topics all the topics that in your head you are thinking that okay i'm going to teach this topic and you're waiting for the topic no i'm going to teach everything so if you stick to this course you're going to see each and every topic being dot okay with that said i'll say a plus plus prints what will it print tell me it is actually going to print the value of a which is 15 i'll tell you how this works but if i change this to plus plus a plus plus a what will happen is i'm going to comment this line out i'll tell you why i'm doing this and i'm going to explain this very very clearly so plus plus a actually increments the value of a with 1. you can see that the value of a was initially 15 but now the value of a has been changed to 16 one has been added to the value of why does this happen so if i say console.log plus plus a prints 16 why does this print 16 and this thing was printing 15 so what happens is when you say a plus plus this means that print a and then increment a print a then add 1 to a which is increment a so when i say a plus plus it will print 15 but actually it will change the value of a to the next time you print a it's going to be 16 okay after this line now plus plus a on the other hand increments first and then prints so in this case it's actually incrementing 15 to 16 the value of a now becomes 16 and 16 is being printed okay the next time you print a a is going to be 16. so this kind of operator actually modifies the value of a and at the same time it might print the incremented value of a in which case will it print incremented value of a in this case it is going to print incremented value of a but in this case it is going to print a as it is and then it is going to increment 1 to a okay i hope that this is very clear to all of you and i hope that you will be able to figure out how decrement operator works in a similar situation i want you to do one thing let's create a quiz for you okay so i want you to tell me what this prints okay and even i don't know what this prints so i want you to tell me in the comments what the output is going to be and then i'm going to discuss it so pause the video tell me what the output of this thing is going to be and then i'm going to you know tell you what the output is going to be okay so i'm waiting for your comment you can pause the video so i hope that you solve this problem and you know posted a comment so when this line actually runs the value of a becomes 16 okay and 16 is printed so i'm going to say 16 is printed and then what happens this is the value of a is now 16 minus minus a will actually bring 15 and the value of a is going to be 15. so it prints 15 and the value of a becomes 15 so this is the value of a now a minus minus the value of a becomes 14 but it prints 15 because we are actually writing a minus printer so it prints 15 first and then it changes the value of a to 14. i'll remove all these because i just wanted to type the current value of a here so this is how the output is going to be and obviously this will print plus plus a prints this is going to be printed okay let me run this a little done because this is the valid javascript program 16 15 15. so i hope that you were able to get the answer right if you weren't then believe me you need to watch this video again okay and i am very very hopeful that you will be able to understand after watching this video once again so we just talked about arithmetic operators now let's talk about assignment operators what exactly are assignment operators assignment operators simply assign a value to a variable so if you say x is equal to y it simply assigns the value of y to x when i say let b is equal to 2 equals to is an assignment operator so let me actually type this assignment operators assignment operators so if i say let c is equal to 5 this is an assignment operator now if i say c plus equals to 7 this means same as c is equal to c plus 7 okay and if i say something like this c minus equals to say 1 this is same as c is equal to c minus 1 okay so this is how this works okay c plus equals to 7 c minus equals to 1 and this is how assignment operators work so equals to you know equals to the plane equals to works the way you expect it to plus equals 2 will actually be similar to this thing x is equal to x plus 5 if you say x plus equals to 3 it means x is equal to x plus 3 if you say x minus equals to 5 it means x is equal to x minus 5 and if you say x divide equals to 7 it means x is equal to x divided by 7 if you say x percentage equals to 8 it means x is equal to x plus and 8 okay so exactly like c plus equals to 7 works c minus equals to 1 works c percent equals to c double star equals to also works okay i hope that this is very very clear to all of you so this is how assignment operator works okay talking about the comparison operators what exactly are comparison operators so comparison operators are designed to return a boolean okay either a is equal to b or a is not equal to b either c is equal to d or it's not equal to d either c is greater than zero or it's not greater than zero let me show you how comparison operators work so let me let me do something like this comparison operators let us say op1 is equal to 5 and we have var5 is equal to 8 these are random names for the variables that i've taken now if i say console dot log 5 is greater than sorry op1 is greater than 0 is it true or false is ob1 greater than 0 or it's lesser than 0 it's actually greater than 0 so true will be printed on the screen the result is going to be a boolean and also if i do something like this op1 double equals to 5 this is also true because equals 2 is an assignment operator double equals to actually checks for value being equal to this number or not so op1 double equals to five means is ob one equals to five yes it is since it is true is printed okay now if i run this program once again you will see or p one equals to equal so 51 is false okay now what's triple equal so if if i do something like this op1 triple equals to 5 listen to this very very carefully this is very important this is something that you might not know again i'm telling you so op1 triple equals to 5 means that is op1 equals to 5 or not and is the type of ob1 is also equal to number the type of op1 is also equal to the type of this literal or not is op1 a number or not both the things so if i do something like this i'll show you one example if i do something like this if i say op1 is equal to 5 if i say op1 let me comment this and let me also do something like this if i say is the value of op1 equals to 5 yes the value of op1 is equal to 5 is the value as well as type of op1 is equal to the value of this and the type of this no the type of this is integer which is a number and type of this is a string okay so these are not the same types is the type of op1 same as type of five type and value okay and i am a copy paster guys seriously i love to copy paste when i can why not copy paste when you can is the value of is the value of not type is the value of open same as value of 5 not not here not here okay so we are basically asking whether the value of op1 is equal to 5 or not okay is it the same as value of 5 now here i'm asking is the type and value of op1 same as type and value of 5 so no type of op1 is string and the type of letter 5 is number if i run this you'll see true and false i hope this is clear crystal clear okay now we have not equals to we even have not double equals to and this exactly does the same thing is the value as well as the type not equal or not so not equal value or not equal type any any one of these okay if i do something like this not double equals to let me show you if i do something like this not double equals to not equals to and not double equals to not double equals to let us say if i do something like this let me remove these comments because i wrote these comments for the previous ones so it's actually showing false and true so op1 is not equal to 5 this is false because ob1 is actually equals to 5 op1 not double equals to 5 yes this is true because the type is not matching value is matching but the type is not matching okay i hope that this is clear now greater than less than greater than or equal to less than or equal to is something that i want you to explore i am not going to tell you each operator one by one i don't want to create sample programs for each comparison operators you guys do it yourself okay as a practice set just do it as a quiz okay and do not skip this part do it try to see if you are able to print op1 is greater than i actually told you greater than so you try greater than equal to less than equal to less than okay all these operators ternary operator is something that i'm going to show you very soon so let's not talk about ternary operator right now but let's talk about logical operators what exactly are logical operators so if we have two booleans okay if we have two booleans logical operators now let us say we have two booleans let b1 is equal to true and let b2 is equal to false okay if i print b1 and b2 what is going to be printed if both of these are true true will be printed if both of these are false false will be printed if one is true one is false and false will be printed this is the and operator and means that both should be true otherwise false okay so let's also print b1 or b2 and is there any other logical operator not if i play not of b1 or not of b2 it is going to reverse okay let me show you all of these one by one if i say b1 and b2 b1 is true but b2 is false both have to be true for this to be true okay if there is an end operator if both the values are true it will print true otherwise false so it's printing false b1 or b2 at least one of these should be true then true will be printed otherwise false will be printed at least one is true b1 is true so true will be printed now not operator actually reverses the boolean value if it's true it becomes false if it's false it becomes true b1 was true so it became false okay i hope this is clear to you so these were logical operators okay now we even have bitwise operators apart from all these we also have type operators and bitwise operators type off is an example of type operator and bitwise operator is something that performs bit by bit operations we are going to see bitwise operators later in this course but for now we are going to skip how bitwise operators work it's actually very simple they convert the number to the binary form first and they uh perform the operation bit by bit okay now one thing that i want you to know is if i say 7 plus 8 is equal to 15 then 15 is the result plus is the operator and these both are operands this is something that should be clear to all of you now let's talk about comments in javascript now we are already using comments okay we are already using comments uh comment is something which is actually ignored by javascript so if i do something like this this is a comment i've actually written a comment here this will be ignored this will not be passed this will be ignored because i have double slash this is a single line comment so this is a single line comment and this is a multi-line comment okay and i can close this comment like this okay so this is a multi-line comment something like this is being displayed this program will run because this is a comment this is something that will not be executed by the javascript engine this will be ignored by the javascript engine and you can see that this is being printed on the screen okay so now a comment in javascript can be written like this i've already told you how single line comment works how multiline comments works now sometimes comments are used to prevent the execution of some lines of code so let us say you have a function and you want it to not be a part of your program so you can simply comment it out you can simply select and in most of the popular ids what you can do is simply press control plus slash and you'll be commented and once again if you press ctrl slash it will be uncommented like this so comment uncomment comment uncomment comment uncomment i hope that you are able to understand this okay so that was all about the operators expressions and comments in javascript explore the notes i have written these notes for all of you and i hope that these notes are worked well for you to understand all these things so if you haven't already access the javascript playlist make sure you bookmark this playlist and actually save this playlist as well thank you so much guys for watching this video and i will see you next time [Music] bye,TRUE

This course is also available in the Hindi Language on  @CodeWithHarry   channel. JavaScript often abbreviated JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2022, 98% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for web page behavior,  often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.
JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard. It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).

The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.

JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but are now core components of some servers and a variety of applications. The most popular runtime system for this usage is Node.js.

Although Java and JavaScript are similar in name, syntax, and respective standard libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.

going to see a lot of questions we are going to practically understand all the javascript concepts which we have understood in chapter number one let's go to the computer screen and let's start solving questions from chapter number one [Music] [Applause] all right so it's time to solve our practice and in this practice set we are going to practice everything that we have learned in chapter one so let's get started let me open this video for you so the question number one says create a variable of type string and try to add a number to it so simply a variable is going to be of type string and you have to add a number to it okay let's see what happens and this is what the question says that see what happens when you try to add number to a string is it possible is it going to throw an error let's find out so i'm going to create a new file ch1ps.js chapter one practice it and i'm going to say console.log um practice set okay so so this is my habit if whenever i'm moving to a new environment i just test using console.log you you run this and if it executes all good if it doesn't see the error try to fix the problem okay now create a variable of time string and add an integer to it so i'm going to say let a is equal to harry okay this is a variable of type string and all i'm going to do here is i'm going to say a plus b where my b is going to be an integer okay so i'm going to say let b is equal to 5 and let me run this and what happened uh what just happened you just saw hadi five is being printed on the screen what does this mean this means that whenever you try to add an integer to a string the integer is converted to a string and the resultant output is a string so these two will get concatenated so this is an observation and i wanted you to make this observation question number two use type of operator to find the data type of a string in the last question i actually meant data type of the result in last question okay so not string i meant result okay so let's try to find out the data type of result so let me do something like this i'll say let result is equal to a plus b okay and i'm going to console log result not a plus b okay and also let me mark the question question number two this is question number one let me not write practice at console log question number one question number two question number question number two says simply do this what is going to come in the terminal as the output string is going to come as the output because the result is a string okay question number two is solved question number three says create a const object in javascript can you change it to hold a number later so all you have to do is create a const object okay let's create but before that let me open the screencast mode question number three says just create a variable let me let me do something like this of type um create a const object in javascript okay so this is this should be an object and not let const okay so i'm going to say names names to marks okay is equal to and i'm going to say harry 45 shivani shivani is going to get 89 marks shivani be happy now raghav raghav you are going to get 23 marks i'm sorry then deepika deepika thank me later now all i'm going to do is i'm going to change the names to colon not colon square bracket deepika to zero okay let us say i'm not happy with dpika anymore i give the bigger 99 marks now i'm not happy with dpika anymore what i'm going to do is i'm going to say okay deepika since i'm not happy with you anymore let me do something like this okay let me do something like this i'll say deepika is equal to 78 so from 99 to 78 i know dp is going to get shocked she's going to say i was getting 99 marks why are you giving me 78 marks what's what's happening i don't know the bigger i'm very sorry now if i print no not print sorry console.log console.log is the print of javascript actually i i i code in a lot of languages and i tend to type different functions from different languages and you know this happens so okay so let me let me show you what what just happened this object is a constant and i was able to change deepika's marks what just happened you must be wondering that this is an object and this is a const object why am i able to change the because marks why why why does it not show that this is a constant and you cannot change the because marks actually this value is not constant this object is a constant which means that i have created an object in memory and names to marks is mapping to this object it's kind of pointing to the object now what is happening is this object is in the memory names to marks is a reference this is the name of the reference and this reference is pointing to this thing now if i change this thing i'm not actually changing the reference of names to class to point to something else i'm just changing the same place in memory to deepika 78 so basically the object remains the same the content of the object changes so when the content of the object changes javascript doesn't have any problem even if the object is a constant i hope you understood that which is why i'm able to change the because marks and this question was just created to teach you this so create a const object in javascript can you change it to hold a number later can you actually change it to hold a number later now let me see can i change it to hold a number later let me see can i do something like this can i do something like this let me solve the question now the question was not this the question was can you change it to hold a number can i do something like this is equal to 8 the answer is no i cannot do this it's going to throw an error because i'm actually changing the value of this reference this reference was actually pointing to this object in memory now i am saying create a new integer in memory and make this names two marks point to this node this is not going to happen names to marks is a reference which is a constant and it is going to point to the same thing in the memory i can do this but cannot do this so let me write here cannot do this but can do this okay let me do something like this and names to marks as you already saw i was able to print it okay now let me now let me run this program just to show you that it works yes it works now the next question says that try to add a new key to the const object in problem three were you able to do it now answer this question in the comments can you add a new key to this object i want all of you to pause this video and type your answer in the comments i am going to test how much you learned from the previous example that i took pause this video and write yes or no can you add a new key to this object and i'm going to tell you the answer to this okay i hope everybody commented now let me add okay and let me debug is a nice guy let me give him 98 but not as nice as deepika was before note that i'm just kidding so names to marks deeper is equal to 98 i'm actually adding a new key to the object names to marks can i do that let's find out let me run this program the answer is yes i can do that because the object remains the same i'm just expanding the same object i can always do that i can either expand the object i can change the because marks to 78 i can do all these things but i cannot make names to marks to point to a different place in memory this is not possible okay let me run this program and show you that this is possible we just added deepak to the object and yes this is a const object but we were able to add deeper to this okay i hope you understood what i wanted you to understand now the question number five says that write a javascript program to create a word winning dictionary of five words okay so this is something that i want you to actually do but let's go to digital.com dictionary.com yes this one okay let me copy paste i can why am i not able to see words like the home page is supposed to show me a few words right so let let me let me say question number four here this is actually question number four this was me explaining question number four this is question number five and the question number five is write a javascript program to create a dictionary so let's do that so i'll say constdict is equal to remember i told you that you you have to use const everywhere you can anywhere you want to use a variable try to use const first if you're not able to use const try to use lit avoid wear okay now constict is equal to this thing let me paste this word ataraxia do you know the meaning of this word no you don't your english is not as good as mine the meaning of attraction is a state of freedom from emotional disturbance and anxiety what are you guys doing very bad okay anyways no problems at all let's talk about the second word do you know the meaning of this no mon you don't the meaning is raised part of the sundial that cast the shadow shame on you you don't know the meaning of this because your english is not as good as mine so let me copy this uh let me copy this and let me paste it i'm actually a better copy waster than you i can challenge you okay do you know yukka you don't know yukka shame on you it means hard work all you so i want all of you to do yaka okay everybody should do yakka yaka is something that that is going to you know give you some success no computer game no laptop no roaming with friends nothing is going to give you success only yakka is going to give you success focus on yakka and forget everything else just kidding ever okay so so i actually wanted to add five words i'm just trying to entertain you guys while i'm adding these words so don't try to take me seriously please so one two three four we have added four words i mean take me seriously while i'm teaching javascript don't take me seriously while i am trying to entertain you okay so you have to figure out when i'm trying to take you in when i'm teaching javascript okay so a fossil footprint okay so let me paste this and let's see if i can print a dick dot yaka okay so it should tell me work specially hard work okay so so you can see that work especially hard work is being printed on the screen i want all of you guys to tell me that whether you are enjoying this course or not i want all of you to tell me in the comment section right now and also if you haven't already access the javascript playlist make sure you do that this is a javascript english playlist make sure you access this so that you have access to all the videos i hope you were able to understand these problems and i hope these practice sets are helping you a lot thank you so much guys for watching this video and i will see you next time [Music] so [Music],TRUE

is a language which has some built-in data types as well as non-primitive data type which is an object there are seven primitive data types in javascript you can learn it like this nnn ssbb and you nn means null and number ss means symbol and string bb means bigint and boolean and u for undefined there are seven primitive data types and object is the non-primitive data type in javascript data types determine what kind of content can be stored in a variable so if data type of some variable is string that means that this variable is holding a string at this point we'll now go to a computer screen and we'll see how to create primitive data types and non-primitive data types and the difference between two and how object is a key value appear which can be used to store data in javascript let's get started [Music] [Applause] in our previous videos we learned about what variables in javascript are we started this course with the basics of programming and i hope you are liking this series if you haven't already bookmarked this playlist make sure you click here to bookmark and um click here to save this playlist now we are going to talk about uh primitives in javascript so i'm going to open this chapter let me open the pdf first and inside the pdf i just told you what where latin const is what is the difference and why and when to use which one okay so now we are going to talk about primitives and objects what exactly are primitive data types in javascript what exactly is a data type in programming language let me answer that question first data type in a programming language is a type of container which can store a specific kind of data let's say i created a variable let me open this and let me do shift right click and open with code and let me create a file for this video i'm going to name the file as 04 underscore primitives dodges okay let me tell you i already have node installed let us say i create a variable let a is equal to 67 let me zoom in a bit i am using control plus scroll to zoom in if you don't know i can actually do toggle screen cast mode and you will see which key is being pressed and this is actually awesome let me tell you so what i'm going to do is i'm going to select a is equal to 67 if i do something like this what is type of a typo is an operator which exactly tells me the type of this variable now you will see what exactly is a type of variable type of variable means the kind of data it is storing let us say i give you a coffee mug i'll ask you what exactly is this story most probably your answer is going to be this is going to store some coffee or maybe tea or some other beverage so if i run this program this is going to tell me that i'm storing a number on the other hand if i do something like this and if i run this you'll see that it now outputs string which means that now string is being stored inside of a so data type is the type which is being stored by a variable now coming back to the nodes primitive data types are set of basic data types in javascript the fundamental data types in javascript object is a non-primitive data type in javascript object can contain a string it can contain a number or arrays or it might even contain another object we'll talk about all these things in our later videos but let's understand the seven primitive data types in javascript null number string symbol undefined boolean and begin null number string boolean and undefined is something that we are going to talk about symbol and big end is something that we are going to talk about in a later video so let's focus on these numbers when i say let a or let b b doesn't contain anything so b will be undefined by default so if i do something like this if i print b you'll see undefined so undefined means something is not defined we haven't made b to contain something okay we haven't stored anything inside this container and the name of the container is b okay i hope that this is clear now if i do something like this b is equal to let us say false false is a boolean variable and let me run this and you will see that false is being printed on the screen now this might confuse some of the people so let me organize this program very very nicely if i do something like this let a wait let me let me print a and then type of a this actually tells you the data type of a okay this tells you the data type of a now if i do something like this b contains undefined by default i want all of you to get access to these programs because i have written comments in such a way that it will make learning better for you okay now if i do something like this b is equal to say 23 b now contains a number because js is dynamically typed wait wait let me change this comment we can uh change the type b contains because b is dynamically typed now let me explain this the first lines are really very clear we are just seeing the data type of a b contains undefined by default b is equal to 23 means that we are changing the value of b from undefined to a number which is 23 okay i hope this is clear to all of you now we can change the type of b uh we can change the type b contains because js is dynamically typed what does this mean javascript is actually a dynamically typed language we have statically typed languages like c language or java but javascript is dynamically typed which means that if a variable is containing a number it can later be made to store a string it can later be made to store a boolean and so on so js is dynamically typed now let me create another variable for you before that let me run this program and show you that this does not throw an error okay i hope that this is clear to all of you now i'll say let c is equal to false and then i'll do c is equal to true this is a boolean variable make sure that f in false is small case and t in true is also lower case okay now these are two types of boolean variables that we have you can either have c to contain false or c might be true now if i do something like this it will show me the value of c as you can see true okay now c is actually a boolean variable and when i change the value of c to true it's again a boolean variable so boolean variables can have two values one of two values true or false okay so we talked about number we talked about string let me show you string as well d is equal to if i do something like this this is a string okay wait let me do console.log and let me do d and you'll see that harry is being printed on the screen what if i do something like this type of d this will tell me the d's of type string okay no surprises there and no prizes for guessing there okay so let me now tell you about boolean i already told you about boolean big intent symbol is something that we are going to see in the later videos null null is something which is confused with undefined sometimes but let me tell you the difference between null and undefined undefined means that we haven't yet defined anything we have just declared a variable and it has it has not been defined null means that we explicitly telling that this variable contains nothing so if i do something like this and do console.log null sorry console.log e e contains null you will see that null is being printed on the screen so null and undefined are two different data types in javascript is something that you need to remember okay so we have talked about data types in javascript i hope that this is very very clear to all of you now we'll talk about object in javascript what exactly is an object primitive data type is something which is the very fundamental type of variable in javascript you can have a string any variable in javascript can either be one of these or can either be made of one of these this is the meaning of primitive data types okay now let's talk about object object is a key value pair in javascript object objects in javascript okay are complex data types no i don't want to write that so github copied is actually showing me suggestions i don't want that okay so if i do something like this let f is equal to come on come on get up co-pilot you are doing great come on get up come on get up co-pilot so this is actually generated an object for me if you don't know what github copy it is you might not have one but this actually suggests you the code as you type now this is this is not related to javascript and i think i need to deactivate my github copied for javascript because i don't want it to distract us while we are typing now let us say i have this object obj is equal to name harry h23 is married false this object is a key value pair if i do something like this obj obj.name this will actually print harry if i do something like this it will print 23. if i do something like this this will print false okay now you'll say why should we use javascript objects javascript objects can be used to store key value pairs so let us say you want to store the name of a student in a classroom and his marks in a subject okay you'll say the name of the person harry and you'll see the marks of the person so let me remove this and let me show you if i do something like this harry let us say mark's obtained a 7 8 78 [Applause] let us say mark's obtained a 90. oh wait a second now let us say i want to write ritika and marks obtained by ritika is 89 and let me also write lavish marks obtained 78 let me write rohan marks obtained 56 not not not not an intelligent student at all no worries so if i do something like this obj dot rohan obj dot rohan is going to return 56 okay i can even do something like this so there are two types of syntax which i can use i can do something like this as well this will also give me the value of one corresponding value to the key row 1 okay so if i run this it will give me 56 again if i change it to say a lovish it will show me this now i'll show you something what if i change this to rohan das okay inside of double quotes now since this is a string the key is a string which contains a space i cannot do something like this obj dot rohan das if i run this this will throw an error so i am bound to use this syntax i'll have to use this syntax this is not going to work wait this is not going to work because of this space in this string okay in the key in the key okay now if i run this program this will work because i haven't closed the key in double quotes okay so i hope that you are getting this i hope everything is cleared object are simply key value pairs we can even have nested objects we can even have values as arrays we can even have values as booleans we just saw and we can even have values as some other primitive data types it's all your choice you are going to see a lot of complicated objects in the future videos so be ready for that and solve this quick quiz very very quickly write a javascript program to name phone number and marks of a student using objects all you have to do is you have to write a program you'll have to store the name phone number and marks of a student and you have to do this using object so come on do that so this is something that i'll expect from you to answer in the comments make sure you write a program and give me the program in the comments and i'll wait for your answer and make sure that you're solving the quiz regularly because this is something which is very important if you practice hard enough you are going to get the results okay and make sure that you access this javascript playlist because this is going to be the place where i'm going to upload everything so i hope that you like this video make sure you access the notes thank you so much guys for watching this video and i will see you next [Music] [Music] you,TRUE

This course is also available in the Hindi Language on  @CodeWithHarry   channel. JavaScript often abbreviated JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2022, 98% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for web page behavior,  often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.
JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard. It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).

The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.

JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but are now core components of some servers and a variety of applications. The most popular runtime system for this usage is Node.js.

Although Java and JavaScript are similar in name, syntax, and respective standard libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.

was found in pre es6 code if you have ever seen any javascript code which was written back in 2000s or maybe late 90s you will see var being used as a keyword to declare variables where is something we should always try to avoid in a javascript code because it can introduce bug in our javascript code on the other hand const is used to create constant identifiers whose values cannot be changed let is used to create block scope variables in javascript we will now go to a computer screen and see what let where and cost are why we should avoid var why we should try to use const as much as possible and why we should use let instead of var to declare a variable which might change later let's get started [Music] [Applause] so in a previous video i showed you what variables are how to choose the names of the variable in this video we are going to discuss the difference between var let and cost let me show you something i've created a file right here and the name of the file which i created is zero three underscore let where cost because i am naming all the files with the video number so that you can find the corresponding code for a given video let me show you what is where var is a classic way of creating a variable in javascript if you want to create a variable in javascript all you have to do is you can do something like this where a is equal to 34 and here is your um variable gate of copilot is suggesting me a lot of things so i'm not taking the suggestions for now where a is equal to 34 means that create a variable and store 34 inside of that variable as simple as that no confusion so far okay var is a keyword which is present in javascript from very early days this was a keyword which was available to us since the inception of javascript and this is a classic way of creating a variable in javascript but there are some limitations with var which is it might introduce some of the bugs in your programs now you might think that why do we care about that why can't we just use var there is a lot of convenience function which we get after using cost and let and i'll show you what that convenience is so before we get started let me show you the notes var versus latin javascript where is globally scoped while let and con start block scope i'll show you what this means if i say var a is equal to 34 and i do something like this console.log a no prices for guessing you will get 34 printed okay now if i change where with let nothing changes nothing changes at all and you will say oh why why why why are we even using lead then i'll show you why we should use let and const instead of now since i have let a is equal to 34 if i create a block this block might be an if statement this block might be while loop for loop it can be any block okay if i do something like this let a is equal to 45 and if i do something like this console.log a what is going to happen firstly 34 is going to print on the screen and then 45 is going to print on the screen as you have already seen okay now if i change this to var and if i do something like this if i do something like this and let me also change this to wire now if i do something like this you'll see 34 45 45 but if i change these to let you see that the output will change so instead of 34 45 45 we'll get 34 45 34 what is happening why did the output change let me explain you why we use lead so var is a classic way of declaring variable in javascript let a is equal to 34 means that a is going to be 34 inside of this block now this is the global scope this is not inside any block so a is going to be 34 and the scope of a is going to be global when we come inside of this block a is 45 but within this block it has nothing to do with the global a okay now if i print a or if i try to change a if i try to do something like this this is not going to change this a which is a global a has no relation at all with this block scope day so if i run this program you will see that 34 934 is printed but when we say where a is equal to 34 what happens is i'm basically creating a global variable a which is 34 and i'm redeclaring a with 45 which means that the global is going to change so i am basically changing my global a to 9. if i run this this is going to print 34 9 and 9. there is no concept of block scope when we use var but when we use let the scope of the variable is within that block only what is the advantage of this what what kind of advantage do we get by using let i'll show you let us say you say where a is equal to 34 you can once again say where a is equal to 89 this is not going to throw any error but this should ideally throw some error because accidentally you might change or redeclare the same variable which might introduce bugs in your program so as a rule of thumb we try to avoid using var and we always focus on let and const so that is something we are going to avoid let me write here avoid var avoid using var okay now because it can be overridden okay so this is something that good github co-pilot is suggesting and it's amazing i love it okay let me come back to the notes and show you some of the properties of flat valence so where as we already saw you can redeclare it you can store anything inside of it this is globally scoped and let in constant block scope now where can be updated and re-declared within its scope which is not a good thing you should not be able to redeclare a variable in javascript but if you are using var you will be able to redeclare so we should use latin cost for this reason because if you are able to redeclare a variable you might even do it accidentally and if you are accidentally declaring a variable this might induce bugs in your program we don't want that now let can be updated but not re-declared i'll show you this if i do something like this let b is equal to 4 i can always say b is equal to 9 but i cannot say let b is equal to 98 once again this will throw an error because b is already defined b is already defined you cannot say let b is equal to 98 once again but if you use var you can do this okay so you you cannot do this with it coming back to the notes cost can neither be updated nor be declared if i'm using something like this now let me show you const if i do something like this const a is equal to 45 and if i do something like this console.log a i think this is going to throw an error because i've already used identifier a yes it is throwing an error let me let me change it to cac means constant a okay let me see if it's printing 45 yes it prints 45 can i change ca is equal to 787 now this is showing me some comments this will throw an error because ca is already defined okay so ca is already defined and it is showing an error you cannot change the value of a constant variable in fact i should not even call it a variable constant is a constant it's not variable you cannot change the value of a constant identifier is something i should say so cos c is equal to 45 will store 45 inside of the ca variable but if i say c is equal to 787 you cannot do that because this is a constant and its value will remain the same throughout the program if i change this cost to let will i be able to change the value will i be able to bypass the error the answer is yes i'll be able to bypass the error because now i can change the value of ca but with const you cannot change the value of ca okay i hope you were able to understand that now point number five and six where variables are initialized with undefined whereas let and cost variables are not initialized with const you always have to initialize so let me show you if you if you do let a a bb if you do let or rather wear bb and cons cc you cannot do const cc because you will have to give it a value you cannot leave it just declared and not initialized this is something which is going to throw an error because cc is already defined no because cc is not defined is not given a value okay this will throw an error because cc is not given a value you should give a value to cc now if i print a a it will be undefined if i print b it will be undefined okay i hope that helps if i do console.log a a b b and this will throw an error so let me comment this and if i run this program it's throwing another y y okay because i'm changing a constant here let me run this program now it will not throw an error so undefined undefined okay point number six says cost must be initialized during declaration unlike let and var so you should initialize cos we already saw that you cannot just leave cost cc like this you will have to give it a value if you don't give it a value you are going to get another so i hope that you were able to understand the difference between let var and cons as a rule of thumb we'll avoid var and we'll always use let and const in our javascript programs so thank you so much guys for watching this video if you haven't already access this playlist make sure you do that thank you so much guys for watching

have seen containers at home you have seen how containers can be used to store household items like rice sugar tea pulses etc in this video we are going to understand what variables in javascript are and why it is important to learn the concept of variables javascript is a dynamically typed language which means that we can change the type of variables at runtime in javascript if you have created an integer you can always change that variable to hold a string later if you have created a variable which is holding string right now you can always change that to hold a number in the future this is called dynamic typing on the other hand static typing is something which means that you cannot change the type of variable at runtime if you have created a variable as an integer it is an integer and you cannot make it a string you cannot store string into that variable so to summarize static typing means that you cannot change type runtime and dynamic typing means that you can change type at runtime we'll now go to our computer screen and understand the concept of variables and we are going to dive a little more deeper let's get started [Music] [Applause] so now we are going to understand what variables are and i am going to open the folder that we created in vs code in order to better structure program what i'll do is i'll go to the chapter and let me open this in vs code first and i'll show you what i'm going to do i'm going to say 0 1 underscore 0 1 means or rather 0 to underscore 0 to means video number 2 and variables dot js okay now a lot of you must be thinking how to execute a javascript program so we are going to use node.js for that so if you don't have the code runner extension code runner um so code runner is an extension which you can enable and you will get this button right here and if i say console.log hello word you will be able to execute this particular program and hello world will be printed in your console now if you think that this is not happening for you or this is not working for you for some reason you can always use replit or you can also do one more thing which i'm going to show you but i'm going to use node.js if you install nodejs along with me you will get this output just like i am getting it but again if you are not able to get it i am going to show you one more way to execute javascript all you have to do is just create an html file and exclamation mark and why is emmet not working okay it's working now what i'm going to do is i'm going to say script okay and inside of script i'll say console.log world okay now after doing this i'm going to install a live server which is an extension where is live server here is my extension okay live server so this is an extension you can always install this extension and the moment you install this extension and reload your browser what you are going to see is uh this particular go live button here just click on this go live button and you will see this just like this and you'll see nothing on the screen but in your console you'll see hello world okay now i'm going to clear all the errors it's giving me an error for fab icon but if you reload this page once again you will see hello world okay so uh all i want to tell you is if you're not able to use node.js you can always follow this method but i'm going to use node.js and i hope everybody will be able to use node.js if you have installed it just like me if you haven't installed it already just go to the previous video and install node.js and you should be good to go i'm going to delete this index.html file because i don't want it to be the part of a source code i'm going to use node.js so whatever i'm going to explain you in this video the corresponding code for that is going to go ahead okay let me open this pdf for you and after opening the pdf i'll show you what i've written inside of this so this is the chapter one of this ultimate javascript course just like we follow some rules while speaking english which is a grammar we have to follow some rules while we are writing javascript code okay i cannot simply write anything here i cannot say console.harry and hello what it's not going to print hello world it's going to tell me that console. is not a function so you have to follow a certain rule if you want to print something on the screen you need to write console.log otherwise this is not going to work okay so we need to follow some rules while we are working with the language now what is a variable it's just like a container that stores a value just like i told you a few minutes back variable is just a container assume a room and assume some space that you located for let us say keeping your gym items and let's say you have another space a wardrobe dedicated to all the items that you're going to wear you have a rack for your shoes now whatever you are keeping inside of your room you have allocated some space for that room just like we are locate some space inside of room to keep items we need to allocate some space in our memory and variable is a container that stores a value and the space that we are locating is mainly reserved for that particular thing so variable is a container that stores a value inside of a memory we can store values which can be integers it can be a floating point number it can be a string it can be arrayed it can be object it can be whatever you want now this is very similar to the containers we use to store rice water oats what have you so you can trade this as an analogy don't take it literally okay now the value of a javascript variable can be changed during the execution of a program this is something which is really very important let us say i have a variable i'll say let a is equal to 45 and the moment i say let a is equal to 45 it's going to allocate uh 45 inside of this container the name of the container is a now if i say console.log and i say a and i run this code you will see 45 is being printed on the screen what if i do a is equal to 98 right after writing let a is equal to 45 in this line it is actually creating a variable a and assigning the value 45 to it and right after that what it is doing is it is assigning the value 98 to a okay so you can always change the values you can always make your variable hold a different value at a later point in the program and you can always do something like this as well i can change the type of this variable to string this is really very important let me write it down for you in the comments you can always change the type of a variable okay you can always change the type of a variable in this case i have changed the type of the variable from a number to a string okay now this might not be allowed in all the languages if you go to c language or c plus plus you will not be able to do that a container which is supposed to store a number in c language will always store a number you need to destroy that number uh that variable and create a new variable if you want to change the type in c language but in javascript if you want to do the same thing you can always do that just like i showed you this is really very important and this is called dynamic typing okay let me write it down for you dynamic typing okay this is dynamic typing so dynamic timing is you can always change the value of a variable change the type of a variable sorry not value the type of the variable and static typing is simply you cannot change okay the type of the variable so javascript is a dynamically typed language okay let me write it down um javascript is a dynamically type language okay let me comment it down for you so this is something which is really very important uh when we say let a is equal to 7 or where a is equal to 7 you can even use var if you want to create variables but i'm going to show you the difference between var let and const in the next video so where a is equal to 7 inside of this particular statement if i try to focus what is happening let is simply a way to create a variable a is identifier when we say let a is equal to 7 let is a keyword which means that i want to create a space in the memory location and is the name of that identifier this identifier should hold value 7 and equal to his assignment operator this is the process of declaring a variable in javascript when i say let b is equal to harry let us say i say let b is equal to harry i am saying that create a memory location with name b and store the string inside of that memory location so this is how variables work in javascript okay but can i do something like this i'll show you something so let us say i say let 56 c is equal to harry or harry too what is happening here why is it showing me errors it is showing me address because there is a set of rules which applies while you choose a variable name this will throw an error okay because you cannot start because of the number in the variable name because variable name cannot start with a number not because of the number if i if i change it to a 56 it will work variable can contain a number but it cannot start with the number because variable name cannot start with the number okay so this is actually github covalent which is suggesting me all this code this is really very helpful when i'm typing the code but let me comment this line because if you run it you will get an error and i don't want that okay now coming back to the rules for choosing variable names you can always have letters you can have digits you can have underscores you can even have a dollar sign inside of your variables but it must begin with either a dollar or an underscore or a letter it cannot start with a number it cannot start with a pound symbol if i try to do something like this let pound a is equal to 7 no you cannot do that okay this will throw an error okay now the third rule says that javascript reserved words cannot be used as a variable name if i do something like this let class is equal to 1 no i cannot do that class is a reserved word or if i do something like this let var is equal to 1 no i cannot do that let const is equal to 1 no i cannot do that okay so this is something that you cannot do because there are some of the keywords which are reserved in javascript and you cannot use reserved keywords while declaring variables in javascript okay now harry and harry are different variables this particular variable and this particular variable are both different they both are different variables javascript variables are case sensitive because when you are actually using h a capital r r y you are using a different variable and when you are using capital h r and y this is a different variable this is treated as a completely different variable because when you say capital h r y and you say hry you can always distinguish between these two because this one contains capital h this one contains small h but it is recommended that you don't mess up with the variable names like this do not create two variables with the same name in different case because it will cause a lot of confusion in your program so this is a suggestion from my side in the next video what i'm going to do is i'm going to explain you the difference between where let and const and it is going to be a very interesting video because i'm going to show you why let var and const are there in javascript and why you should use which one and when okay so this is something that we are going to discuss in the later videos if you haven't already accessed the notes and source could please do that because i have written these notes for you and i want all of you to access these notes also make sure that you access the playlist and bookmark it and also save it thank you so much guys for watching this video and i will see you next time [Music],TRUE

This course is also available in the Hindi Language on @CodeWithHarry  channel. JavaScript often abbreviated JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2022, 98% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for web page behavior,  often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.
JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard. It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).

The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.

JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but are now core components of some servers and a variety of applications. The most popular runtime system for this usage is Node.js.

Although Java and JavaScript are similar in name, syntax, and respective standard libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.
JavaScript is the world's most popular programming language.
JavaScript is the programming language of the Web.
JavaScript is easy to learn.

powerful web applications in the modern world if you don't know javascript it will be very difficult for you to create powerful web applications and become a successful web developer but on the other hand if you can master javascript it will be very easy for you to create powerful efficient and smooth web applications in this course we are going to cover all the concepts of javascript along with my handwritten notes and all the source code which we are going to write in this course will be provided to you in the description i request all of you to like this video and comment this javascript course is helpful down below this way my efforts will be able to reach a lot of students and i'll really appreciate it the first video of this course is going to be introduction to programming and a lot of you might find it unexpected to get an introduction to programming in this javascript course but when we start things from scratch the experience is really very different believe me we'll start from the basics and then we'll raise the bar like anything in our later videos i can assure you that this javascript course is going to be game changing for your carrier this is the ultimate javascript course let's get started [Music] [Applause] so the very first thing that i am going to do right now is install va score which is visual studio code let me show you how to install visual studio code all you need to do is type install visual studio code and you should see this screen simply click on download visual studio code and just download it and install it like a game on your computer i know you must have downloaded a lot of games in your computer just install it like a game after the setup is complete downloading simply click on the setup and install it like a computer game as i already told you simply accept the agreement simply click on next and the most important thing you need to check these boxes i repeat you need to check all these boxes this is really very important i'll tell you why we are checking these boxes simply click on next install and you should be good to go now note that i already have vs code installed on my machine and running the setup won't cause any harm i'll simply uh click here because i don't want to launch vs code right now i'll simply click on finish now i'll come back to this folder and you'll see two pdf files these are my handwritten notes which i'm going to supply along with this course all i'll do right now is create a folder with chapter zero chapter zero will contain the code as well as the pdf for chapter number zero and i'll also say chapter one chapter one will contain the pdf of chapter one as well as the notes of chapter one okay going back i'll simply open this folder in vs code so in order to open a folder in vs code all you need to do is press shift on your keyboard right click and click on open with code now vs code is installed on my machine which is why i'm seeing this option remember we checked those two boxes this is one of the reasons why we checked those two boxes now simply click on open with code and you will see this folder opened in ps code now if you are new to vs code no problems at all because i am going to show you everything from scratch and yes if you already know what vs code is what javascript is what programming is this chapter might be a little bit boring for you but please bear with me and if you listen to me i'm damn sure that you're going to learn something new with this chapter from the notes what is programming programming is a way to talk to computer so let us say i want to talk to you i'll use english or hindi maybe bengali spanish japanese or whatnot okay so in order to converse with somebody we need a medium that medium is the language that we are talking in in the same way in order to talk to computers we need programming language so programming is simply a way to talk to computers because we cannot use a mod to talk to computer i cannot say hey computer please record this audio and i even cannot you know show my feelings to the computer and also i cannot express my feelings to the computer i cannot say hey computer i'm feeling bad tell me what to do it's not going to tell me what to do until and unless we have programmed it to do so so computer is dumb it's very dumb it's just fast with specific stuff of calculation but otherwise it is really very dumb computer is not at all smart when when was the last time you ordered some cereal and got dvds of cereal now let us say you want to order some cereals to eat if you tell somebody hey get me some cereal i want i'm hungry i want to eat something and what if somebody gives you dvd of cereal hey this is the cereal watch it on your computer but you are hungry you will say hey i was hungry i wanted to eat the cereal i'm not talking about the tv show cereal i'm talking about the cereal which we eat so computer is a dumb machine and very similar you need to specify exactly what you want to do you need to specify hey i want to eat cereal so you need to go to the market at this particular shop get me the cereal and then only computer will be able to get the correct thing or the correct task done for you okay the programming is the act of constructing a computer program a set of precise instructions telling a computer what to do so in order to tell computer exactly what to do you need a programming language and in this course we are going to learn javascript which is a programming language used to program websites it can be used in backend it can be used in front end and what not now even you can create desktop application using electron so if i show you electron.js you can simply create desktop applications using javascript so javascript is evolving like anything now let's talk about what is ecmascript ecmascript is a standard on which javascript is based so it's basically a set of rules in which javascript is based it was created to ensure that different documents of javascript are actually talking about the same language so if we have a lot of documents and different documents are talking about the same standard in different way it is going to be a problem so this standard was built so whoever is researching on javascript wants to add new feature to the language they can simply come and add those features to ecmascript acme script is a standard on which javascript is based so anything we want to introduce to javascript we can simply introduce it in atma script standard and we are good to go now javascript and ecmascript can almost always be interchangeably used javascript is very very liberal which means that even if you are not using a semicolon or you are making some very silly mistake it will try to understand what you are trying to say and it will execute something for you instead of throwing an error and stopping everything now how to execute javascript javascript can be executed right inside one's browser so now if i want to execute javascript the fastest way for me to execute javascript is simply come to some tab simply right click and click inspect and i should be able to execute javascript in the console so if i say console.log you don't have to worry about what i'm doing i'll simply say hello word and this will be executed here and you'll see that hello world is printed on the screen i'm going to explain everything that i did here you don't have to worry about what i did here but the fastest way for me to execute javascript is right inside the browser because our browser contains javascript engine which is capable of executing javascript okay now another way to execute javascript is a runtime like node.js which can be installed in somebody's machine and they can run javascript inside of node.js now what exactly is node.js so somebody in i guess 2000 um i don't know node.js i'll show you the history of node uh let me open wikipedia and i'll show you how ryan dahl created node.js and in which year it was created so it was originally created in 2009 so what this guy basically did was he took out the javascript engine from the browser and put it inside a c plus plus program which was capable of executing javascript outside of the browser now node.js can be used to run javascript outside of the browser i'm not going to go into details of how node.js was created and all let me come back to the topic which is javascript now node.js can be used to execute javascript okay so in order to install node.js you can simply go to google and simply type install.js and this might sound haunting to some of the people because they must be like hey this is my first programming language i have never ever heard of programming and you are making me install so many programs do not worry simply install it for your operating system if you're on a mac simply install it for a mac if you are on linux you can even install node.js for linux okay now i am going to simply run this and next next next and it should simply read the license agreement i've read it believe me next next and you can simply click next do not check this simply click next and install okay now it will ask you for some permissions and you should be good to go okay now this will install node.js on my machine and i'll show you what will happen you can simply right click on your windows icon and go to windows partial and let let me close this at this point i want to wait for it to install first now it has been installed so i can simply go to partial and i can say node and i can basically use javascript here so this is a javascript runtime i can say hello like this okay so this is how we can actually run javascript outside of the browser okay i hope this was not haunting i hope everybody was able to install node.js and i hope that you enjoyed what we did in this lesson we have a long way to go a very long distance to cover but believe me this journey is going to be fantastic we'll go to the next chapter and after going to the next chapter we'll understand what variables in javascript are we are going to understand the programming basics using those concepts that we are going to learn in the coming chapters now there is one more line which i wrote here yet and the way to execute javascript is by inserting it inside script tag of an html document so if you put a javascript code inside script tags it will actually execute in the browser we are going to see all these things in the coming lessons i hope this was not haunting and i hope that you were able to understand what we did in this lesson so i'll create a javascript playlist and i'll link it in the description as well as in the pinned comment i want all of you to access that playlist so that we all are on the same page so that you are able to access the course in a very systematic manner down in the description will be links to download this pdf you can simply download this pdf and this will be all yours so yeah thank you so much guys for watching this video and i will see you next time [Music] i,TRUE

python programming language to get this job done videos beautiful soup we will be using request package from python we'll also be using random which is a built-in package in python programming language and we'll be using soaks which is a proxy service capable of providing over 8 million ip addresses which is great we'll be using all these ip addresses to hit amazon.com in order to extract reviews out of amazon if you're confused already don't be because i'm going to take you to my computer screen and show you how all of this is done let's get started so guys we are back so let me open this particular folder in vs code i've created a folder for this entire thing we are going to do the extraction of amazon reviews so let me open this folder in vs code right click shift right click by the way open with code and then i'm going to create a main dot py so let me first take you to soaks.com and show you what soaks.com is all about so soaks.com is a proxy service it's an amazing service i use it all the time and it can actually help you extract out reviews because it can give you anonymous proxies out of the box and they have eight 8.5 million active ip addresses which is amazing let me take you to my account if you haven't already created account on socks.com you'll have to first create an account and then you'll have to copy your account this is my account so what i'll basically do is i'll simply go to this proxy list and i'll choose login and password output format is going to be file and filter is going to be all geo and let me show you what it downloads for me so this is the file it downloads for me and i'm going to use this as a proxy how am i going to do that let me show you so the very first thing if you are starting out from scratch the very first thing you need to do is install python so this is the very basic step you will have to install python and vs don't tell me that you don't have python and vs code installed on your machine you will have to download it okay so install python go to this website download python install vs code go to this website install vs code it's very simple you can install vs code and file just like you install a game on your computer okay so i'm going to say import request and i'm going to say import ps4 or rather from vs4 import beautiful so for those who are beginners and just starting out to use python let me tell you that i'm using a python extension so you can simply go to vs code and you can write python here and you will get this extension okay this is the extension which i'm using now what i'll do is i'll simply import uh what else uh i don't know yeah pandas as pd okay i don't think we need any more packages uh even if we install any more packages uh i'll let you know okay so you can say pip install ps4 and pandas and these two packages will be installed for me both of these packages are already installed so i need not install them again and again okay so let me now import random as well and i'll tell you why we are importing random now since we are extracting amazon reviews i'll simply create a list i'll say review list is equal to a blank list okay so this is a blank list which i'm creating and i will be appending all the reviews inside of this list okay now let me write a function to get a random proxy and what what is random block c in fact what even is a proxy i'm going to tell you just give me a moment so i'll tell you how to use stokes proxy let me specifically mention how using soaks proxy why use soaks proxy first of all because you can get unlimited ip addresses you don't have to hit amazon using a single ip address you need multiple ip addresses if you want to extract all the reviews out of amazon and if you want to extract reviews even in bulk you'll have to keep changing your ip address and hit amazon so i hope that it is clear why we are going to use a proxy in this project now let me show you how to actually use a proxy so we are going to use a request package and i am going to create a proxy like this okay so this is simply uh a dictionary wherein we have http and https we'll be telling python request that hey for http use this proxy for https use this proxy okay now if i want to directly use proxy i can simply say something like this let me copy paste why am i even typing i don't even need to type so we can say something like http and we can copy paste this one and same for https so i can do the same thing with https as well okay but soaks has ports from 9000 to i guess 9000 um i don't even remember so uh just a moment let me check so it has ports from 9000 to 9050 or something i don't even know uh so port number you can change port number i guess up till nine three double zero nine two double line so from nine thousand to nine to double and you can keep changing your ports so what i'm going to do is i'm going to use an f string here and let me copy this one and what i'm going to do is i'm going to say that hey just add and i'm going to do the same thing here as well so let me use multi-cursor functionality of vs code and for you to see what am i typing i want to toggle the screencast mode so i'll use random dot random and we are going to generate a random integer from 0 to 299 okay so this is a random integer which i am going to generate now in order to test this proxy and see what kind of ip address we are having like what is the ip address that we are hitting the request with let me tell you how to do that so soaks gives a checker so there is a link which you can hit and they will tell you what is your ip address and country and city etc etc so i'll simply say resp is equal to requests request dot get and the url is i guess https http checker.com api slash ipinfo and not to forget you have to say proxies is equal to proxy okay now i'll simply print resp dot text okay resp dot text and let me run this and the moment i run this nothing happens because i have not called the function okay so you need to call the function okay and also let me put this review list here okay so if i run it again why is it not printing huh so this is status true reason is something data is something so city is karachi in this case and city is novo kubask i don't even know how to pronounce this so let me run it again and we'll see some other city and country and this is how proxy is going to help us okay so now coming back to extracting reviews we will need to extract reviews from here let me show you where from here okay so since i need to extract reviews from here i will have to first take a product page okay so in order to take a product page i can simply take user input but in this case i'm going to hard code that okay so let me hard code that i'll simply say uh a is equal to or let me even write it properly product url is equal to so this is going to be our product url okay and let me remove this uh this thing okay so if i click this url let me see if we are being taken to this page yes we are now in order to generate the review url uh this url from this let me remove slash ref from here as well so if i want to generate this url from this url all i need to do is replace dp with product reviews very very simple you can see i just need to replace dp with product reviews okay so let me do that i'll come here i'll say review url let me let me zoom in a bit because review rl is equal to and in order to generate the url from product url i'll simply say for url dot replace i want to replace a dp with with what let me check with product reviews okay so let me copy this let me paste this here okay so we have simply replace dp with product reviews okay now what we'll do is we'll also append the page number now you will ask what is page number why are we even interested in appending the page number i'll simply click on next page and you will see that the page number is coming in the url as a get parameter so we'll have to add this parameter in order to mention the page and in order to navigate to the next page so i'll simply say page number is equal to and this is going to be an f string for us and i'll simply say pg pg is the page number okay now i'll also say pg is equal to 1 because uh initially pg is going to be 1 okay now i also need total number of pages okay i'm going to deal with that later but let me tell you we need the total number of pages so that we can know how long to navigate okay now what i'm going to do is i'm going to simply run a for loop and i'm going to extract reviews for every page but in order to extract reviews for every page i'll have to extract reviews for a single page okay so let me write an extract reviews function and extract reviews function is going to take a review url url and it is going to take the page number okay why am i giving it a page number you'll know okay so i'll simply say pg you don't even have to give the page number but i'm just taking it there so that i can have a better idea of what i'm doing okay so i'll say def this thing and i'm going to create a function here okay so now we have the review url we have the page number now we need to extract the reviews out of this page okay now what i'm going to do is i'm going to simply say resp is equal to request dot get request url okay re review url sorry review url and also proxies is equal to get random proxy okay this is a function now inside of this function we were actually printing this okay but i don't want to do this i want to actually return this okay i want to return this proxy i'm not interested in checking the ip address okay i don't want this i simply am interested in getting a random proxy which i've already got okay the response is this i want response.txt and i want to create a soup out of it so inside of beautiful soup you need to mention the text textual form of the html which i'm going to get like this resp dot text text and i am going to mention that this is an html and i want to parse this html using html dot parser okay so this will pass this text as an html okay i hope this is clear for all of you also what i'm going to do now is i'm going to extract all the reviews not just one review all the reviews on the page so we got the page we got the page data we created soup out of the page data but i am not interested in creating just the soup i want the reviews as well so inside of one page in amazon you can count there are 10 reviews one two three four five okay so here we have just five reviews nobody's one two three four five okay if i go to the previous page one two three four five six seven eight nine ten so maximum ten reviews are there okay so let me do one thing let me do one thing i'll come back here and what i'm going to do is i'm going to say reviews is equal to soup dot find all and i'm going to say find all the elements which are div where data hook is review now how do i know this i'll show you how do i know this okay so where data hook is review if i take you to an amazon review and i click inspect you will simply see the data hook is review for a review okay so let me go further up further up further up further up okay so data hook is equal to review so for a review the data focus review so this is a very good target for me to target the review okay so if i mention data hook is equal to review i'm going to get 10 divs and all these 10 devs are going to be reviews okay now i want to extract text out of these reviews so in order to do that i'll simply say for item and reviews okay and for all the items i'm going to generate a review dictionary now inside of my revolutionary i'll have product title product title is something i'm interested in and i can get the product title by saying soup.title.txt.replace why am i replacing i'll show you if i go to view page source and i show you the title you can see that there is this text written just before the product name i need to remove this text let me zoom it for you so this is the review page sorry title of the page not review page let me reset it coming back i'll simply say replace this with nothing i want to replace this with nothing i don't want anything in place of this just remove this okay this is my title okay now what i'm going to do is i'm going to say a review title so this was a product title and let me mention it like this why am i even using the camel case i need not use the camel case so i replaced this with product title review title now what i'm going to do is i'm going to say item dot find i'm going to find all the a's where data hook is review title okay and the process of finding this particular thing is always going to be the same so here data hook is review title how do i know this because i have actually inspected this element wait let me show you which element this element okay and this is the review title let me show you where is review title database review title here okay so this is the review title now i'll place a comma here let me zoom out and show you what we are doing the third thing that i am interested in is reading okay i'll say reading r a t i n g this is the rating and i want to say item dot find find all i's with data hook is review star rating and this can be verified by going to the site okay if you go to this particular stars if you click inspect you'll see review start rating is the data hook for this and the element is i so you get extract like this this is how i have extracted okay now what i'm going to do is i'm going to extract the review body okay review body now review body is a span and the data hook is review body i guess but i'm going to double check i'm going to double check i'm going to double check the data hook for uh for review body yes it's a span and the data is review body so this is how i'm extracting the review body out of this okay now we have the review title we have rating we have review body you can even have the review date if you want okay so the data for review date is review dash date if i'm not wrong you can even have the date okay so you can say review date okay just to better analyze which review was uh written on which date okay so review date i need to oops review date yes so for everybody we have review body we started in review title and product title for this we just replaced the title of the soup note that we are not using item.title because this is the title of the page the very page which we have extracted from the review url okay the page that we got after visiting the review url okay now all i need to do is uh append this to review list i'll simply say list or depend review append this review to the review list okay so this should extract page number one for me let me see if it's even extracting page number one for me and at the end what i'm going to do is i'm going to say df is equal to pd dot data frame data frame and review list okay so i'm going to create a data frame out of review list and i'm going to say df dot 2xl output.xlsx index is equal to false okay let me run this program now so this should extract the reviews out of the first page and they should create a file called output.xlsx and i should be able to see all the uh all the output weight i've made some mistake here so here i'm getting the uh i'm getting the element but i'm not getting the text out of that element so what i need to do is i i should not say just item dot find and data hook is equal to this i should even do dot txt text because i want to extract the text out of it okay and it would be better if i even do strip because if there are any spaces after or before that particular text they will be stripped let's wait for it to finish and let's see if we are on the right track so output output.xlsx it just finished running let me open this and see and there is nothing what's wrong here let me check what's wrong here let me run it once again i don't know what's wrong did i select a text and run it no uh i'm not sure what's happening i simply said item dot find this then dot text dot strip let's see if there is any output oh yes we have 10 um reviews so review title is anyway star ratings out of 5 are this and if you just want the rating you can simply say dot split out and you can simply take three point zero four point zero five point zero out of this entire string okay so this is also possible but reviewed in india on this state this state did that okay so you can you can always strip the text out okay if you want to strip off this particular text you know what to do simply remove this text okay so we have 10 reviews but we are not interested in just 10 reviews we are interested in even more reviews okay so how do we do that let me show you okay so what i'm going to do is i'm simply going to uh find out the total pages so i'll simply write a function to to find total pages okay for a product okay sorry this is going to be review url so you need to give me the review url and after you give me the review url i will be finding the total number of pages inside that review url okay so let me run to resp is equal to request dot get review url and the proxies is going to be get random proxy okay and this is a function of course now what i'll do is i'll simply say soup is equal to beautiful soup and resp dot text html dot parser this is something that we've already discussed now reviews is equal to i'll simply say sub dot find div which div do i need to find where data hook is something i don't know what okay i'm going to find out so what am i interested in let me tell you i'm interested in this number 15 with reviews i'm interested in this number and i can get this number from data who is this okay i can get this number from here so i'll simply say data hook should be data should be this okay and the moment i do this i can actually extract the text out of this so i'll simply say return integer because at the end of the day i need to convert this to integer reviews dot and text dot strip so that i can strip off these pieces which are um which are there okay on the left and on the line of this text and once i strip the text out i'll simply say split and i will split with comma space the moment i split with comma space i get a list with two elements one is this and one is this i'm interested in the second element that is index one so i'll say one okay i'll save one and i hope i'm doing this right one and then i'll say dot split once again and what should i split with this time i'll split for the space and i'll take the first element so if i split this the selected text with a space i will get this 15 this is the number and what is going to be the number of pages the number of pages is going to be um this divided by 10 okay and plus 1 i'll also plus i'll also do plus 1 because this entire number plus 1 or rather i'll say 1 plus this integer okay 1 plus this integer because let us say the number of reviews are 15 we have 10 per pages uh 10 reviews per page the number of pages should be two okay so 15 divided by 10 15 so if i show you the wrapper let me show you python and if i say 15 divided by 10 this is going to give me one so i need to add another one because there will be two pages in that case okay let me exit this having said that what i'll do is i'll simply find out number of pages so i'll say pages is equal to or let me say and pages is equal to uh total pages review url okay this is the review url and the moment i get the total number of pages i will run a for loop and inside of the for loop what i'm going to do is i'm going to simply um i'm going to simply generate this review url okay i'm going to simply generate this review let me copy this review once again so i'll say for i in range and and pages i'll simply say page number is equal to i plus 1 okay so this is going to be i plus 1 page number is going to be i plus 1 because index starts from zero okay and what i'm going to do again is run this extract pages okay oops press the wrong key sorry about that so product url is this review url is this and we have [Music] i hope i'm going in the right direction so i ran the review url is equal to something extract reviews this and also i want to put it inside of try catch because in case my request fails for one url i don't want my entire data to be you know wasted except exception as e and i'll simply print e and let me make it capital e okay now let me delete this output of this xlsx file so i've deleted the output.xlsx file and i'm going to run this program let me see if i have made any mistake or this is going to run properly i don't know so it just ran for all the pages let me see if it extracted all the reviews so we just have 10 reviews why so let me find out values for different so i'll simply print so also running for these many pages and i'll put n pages here and i'll say control d and also running for page i okay let me remove this and let me let me say plus one okay let me run this so it's running for two pages running for page number one and it's running for page number two and done okay let's see if it's able to extract all the reviews or not so yeah it actually extracted all the reviews if you see the count uh the count of these rows is 15. so it extracted 15 reviews amazing great so this is how you extract reviews from amazon and i hope that you were able to you know find out how to extract reviews from amazon but let me improve this program even bit further we don't need this we don't need pg all we need is product url at one place let me now do one thing let me say product url is equal to input okay i'm going to select all this i'll say input enter product url okay let me run this program and what i'm going to do is simply enter product url for some other product okay let me find some other product on amazon let's do for this one okay so i'll simply copy this url and i'll paste it here let me close output at xlsx because if i don't close it i'm going to get an error and i'll press enter so there are uh okay so it says pg is not defined what's wrong okay so pg this should be i plus 1 i don't even know why i've given this pg here we don't need it we don't need it but again let me run the program again place the url and how many pages are there it is only one page for reviews let me check if this is true so there are only 20 ratings so that's fine okay let me open some popular product so that we have a lot of reviews for that product and we can text test okay let me open output.xlsx this is great okay so there are only three reviews with um with review body so it extracted all these okay round hole in the fabric got entirely different color to after two washes the t-shirt is shrunk okay let me let me remove this now what i'm going to do is i'm going to wait i'm going to run the program first and then punch in this url and this has quite a lot of ratings let me check how many 13 000 ratings so i'll scroll down and i'll save you see all reviews okay so we are running into this error because there is a comma in this number and we need to remove all the commas from all the numbers okay so i need to write another line here to remove this comma okay so this is getting interesting now uh let me remove the comma after i take this text okay so i'm going to say end of this no end of not this i'm going to say dot replace the comma with a blank okay now let me run it again and let me see if it's running two five eight six two five nine pages so there are two five nine pages in fact one plus two five nine pages okay so uh it says the total running for two five nine pages okay so we are running for page number eight page number nine so there are a lot of pages so this is going to be a huge file but what i'm going to do is in order to make you understand how all this works i'm going to leave it and i'm going to come back when it finishes so finally it has gotten completed and let me show you the output.xlsx there are a lot of reviews let me see how many of these there are 2171 reviews and it indeed missed some of the reviews so as part of uh homework what you can do is you can wrap this particular thing inside of a retry loop so the moment something fails you're going to retry it okay and you need to keep retrying it for at least say 10-20 times and once you have got the reviews out of that page then you should be good to go but again this is amazing we had around 2200 and something reviews i don't remember but we have got almost all of those okay this is a lot of data and amazon is not going to give you all this data and soaks is a very nice easy and sweet way to extract this data out of amazon try it out for other products make some changes make some tweaks try it out for other website soaks is amazing you can expect a lot of data from a lot of websites thank you so much guys for watching this video and i will see you next time [Music] you,TRUE

analysis using python although we can analyze any kind of data but i am going to use a sample sales data in a csv file to start this multi-dimensional analysis using a toti we will see how to read the sales data and start analyzing it using autot and most importantly why you should use auto to analyze this data in multi dimension multi-dimensional analysis is really helpful when you have huge data and you want to analyze it in multi dimensions one cool features about autot is that it gives you a web application which can be used to analyze your data and deep digger into your data that two in multi dimensions let's go to the computer screen and we'll get started with analyzing our data using a totee so i'm inside of my computer screen and the mission of this video is going to be to explain you a totee in a very simple way so that you can start analyzing your data and view your data with a different perspective so what i'll do is i'll open a totee documentation so if you simply type a total documentation in your browser you can simply click on the 2t dot io website you will be taken to this page you can simply go to installation and i'm also opening the tutorial side by side which i'm going to follow now let me tell you about this tutorial this tutorial basically loads a sales data and then it starts analyzing and derive multiple insights from it using a doty so let's come to the installation first in order to do the installation all i'll do is i'll press shift right click and open the powershell window and after i open the powershell window i'll simply write pip install a totally jupyter lab but before i run this command i want to show you what it exactly means but before that let's install a tortilla so let me come to this page let me copy this command and after i paste this command and run it it is going to install the latest version of a toti as well as the auto jupiter lab extension so let me show you something when you type paper install auto t and you type jupiter lab in the square brackets we are basically saying installer totally as well as the jupiter lab extension from auto now there are a lot of other extensions from autot you can go to plugins page i can you know search for plugins in the documentation and i can go to this page and after i go to this page here are some of the available plugins which can be installed simply by adding their names in the square bracket after pimp install auto you can see the syntax but we are interested in the jupiter lab extension as of now so i'm installing a toti along with the jupiter lab extension so far so good we have installed the toti the latest version of doty is installed and also we have the jupiter lab extension of auto so what i'm going to do is close this reference or maybe i'll keep it open and come to the tutorial and i'm going to run this command now what this command is going to do is this will give you a tutorial folder which will contain a sample ipython notebook as well as the sales data which we are going to analyze using a toti so i will simply you know open windows powershell which is already open here i'll issue this command and after i run this command you can see that a new folder is created tutorial let me close this powershell window and let's try to see what is inside of this tutorial there is some sales data there is i buy the notebook there are some of the images here so let's do one thing let's open this folder in partial and let's type jupyter lab now do not use jupyter notebook and you must use jupiter lab in order to leverage the auto extension for jupiter lab some of the people might use jupiter notebook it will work sometimes but you will not get the powers of this jupiter lab extension from adobe so it's highly recommended that you use jupiter lab and not jupiter notebook let's create a new ipython notebook i'll create a new ipython notebook i'll simply click here and let me rename this to a toti tutorial so i'll say a toti [Applause] dot ipython notebook and this is a fresh ipython notebook which has been opened okay now what i'm going to do is come to the tutorial and i'll copy this i'll import a toti as td and then i'll create a new session now what is the session in order to analyze my data using a doty i need to create a 2d session now once the session is created i can always do session dot read csv to read data now there are multiple ways to read data in a doty this particular command is saying there is a csv file inside data called sales.csv open that file and the keys with which we want to open this wireless sales id so if i press shift enter and if i say sales table dot head so here we have the first five rows from our data set you can see that we have sale id as our key and we have uh you know date shop product quantity unit price as some of other columns so we have read using a csv file but what if we have a data frame ready for us we can always read data in different ways using a total let me search for read pandas so if i write read in the search of adobe you can always press ctrl k by the way in order to search something in the 20 documentation you can do read csv you can do read numpy you can do read pandas you can do read spark read parkway there are a lot of ways i'll show you read pandas before we move on and this is how you can read a pandas data frame if you have a data frame ready if you are already analyzing your data using pandas and you want to use auto you can always pass data frame inside of free pandas method and you can do the similar things that i'm going to show you okay so we have our sales data ready we have already seen the sales data now what i'm going to do is create a cube now this is a concept that you need to understand and listen to me very very carefully when i explain this a cube inside of autot is a way to look data in multiple dimensions let me create this cube this cube is created and let me walk you through some of the multi-dimensional concepts a cube is a multi-dimensional view of some data it can be any data in our case this is the sales data which we have created the cube of now we can easily explore aggregate we can perform a lot of operations run queries on this data but why do we want to analyze this in multi-dimensions why have we created a cube because we want to see a data from a different perspective we want to see in how many which was a day where we sold the maximum product let us say or which is a product which is performing the best in our e-commerce store so these are the kind of insights that we want to derive from our data let's understand what is a hierarchy in a cube so we have already understood that cube is a multi-dimensional view of some data it's just a way of looking at a data now access of this cube are called hierarchies the max human eye can look at is three dimensions but we can have multiple dimensions or rather multiple dimensional cube to analyze our data now the access of these of the cube is hierarchies in this case product shop and date are the hierarchies we have product as a hierarchy we have shop as a hierarchy and we have data as the hierarchy we might have even more hierarchies but in this case we have only three hierarchies now let's try to understand what are majors majors are basically numerical indicators where we can you know have a look at numerical data we can see how many uh you know uh what is the mean of the product sold what is the sum of the products sold and all sort of numerical computations can be done using measures so it is very safe to say that all the categorical columns in our data are going to take the form of hierarchies and all the numerical data points in our data are going to take the form of measures now we have hierarchies we have majors if i ask you in this case we have date shop and product as our hierarchies and quantity and unit price as our measures let us try to run this command and let us see what we get when we run cube dot hierarchies no surprises no prizes to guess we have date per product sales id and shop as our hierarchy sales sale id is also a hierarchy because this is also one of the categorical columns in our data now if i run l is equal to cube dot levels but before that let me run m is equal to cube dot majors to show you that measures are numerical data so we have the mean sum and all of these things but let me come back to the you know totally documentation you know hierarchies in a total are made of levels and levels of the same hierarchy are attributes with a parent child relationship so it's basically a drill down you have geography inside of geography you have a country and inside of country you have a city and so on so you can have multiple levels while analyzing data so i have done l is equal to q dot levels we have majors let's try to run something called a query so if i do something like cube dot query m quantity dot sum you can see that it has summed all of these things and shown me over here so these are only five rows from our data but data consists of a lot of rows so when we add the quantities across all the rows we'll get this number but this doesn't give us any good insight right so let us try to get some better insight from our data let's try to run this query which simply shows us which shop has sold how many number of products but i have not ran this l is equal to cube.levels i need to do this so let me copy this there is a copy button by the way i can use this so uh if i do shift enter you can see that i have quantity dot sum for all the shops now this is a better insight from the state i can see that shop zero has sold these many quantities shop 15 has sold these many quantities and i can see which shop is doing the best by simply analyzing this data before we move further i want to show you one more thing if i do something like df is equal to let me do something like this i'll say df is equal to q dot query and quantity dot sum the same thing i can simply do type of df and this is not a pandas data frame it's in a 20 query result if i do something like this df is equal to df dot reset index and if i do type of df now this is a pandas data frame as you can see so this is something that you need to know if you want to convert your autoquery result into a pandas data frame you can simply run df.reset index now let's try to run some more queries i'll come back to the documentation and let me run this one i'll run this one let me copy this one and i'll paste it here and shift enter and you can see that in this query i'm simply saying that i want to see quantity dot sum across dates and products so we have a date we have a product and we have quantity sum now this is even better inside because i can see that on which date which product was sold for how many quantities i can see that bet 26 was sold for six quantities on this date and this product was sold for sex on this date and so on so this is even a better insight for me if i want to say visualize this i can do something like session dot visualize and i'll show you what it does it simply visualizes your session inside of a totally now what does this mean you can simply click on say quantity dot sum and you can simply click on date and you can see on which date how many sales were made in order to verify that this is the total you can simply select this data and you can see the sum you can see the minimum maximum average count and count of numbers so sum is 2412 and the minimum is you know this thing maximum is this thing i think i have not selected the entire data so i'll i need to select the entire data and then the sum will match eight zero seven seven and this total is eight zero seven seven let me see what is the maximum number out of all these 271 is the maximum number out of all these minimum is 265 and average is this count is this these are 30 numbers and count of numbers is 30. so this is a great way to analyze your data simply by you know selecting it and seeing what is the average what is the you know all other numerical measures like uh maximum minimum and so on now let's go a step further and start taking the shops inside of our data if i drag shop over here inside of date what will happen is this will show me a drill down i can see which date on which date which shop made how many sales and i can even go further and you know drill it drill down by sale id so i've simply dragged the sale id over here and i have i can see that uh this is what i see now i can always close this and i can um you know make it once again i can say date and then i can say shop and then i can say shop sale id okay so i can get this this sort of drill down always let me close this i actually wanted the date and then the shop not here i want to drag the shop here so that it is a hierarchy inside of you know date and then i want sale id inside of my shop so this is how i can you know get nested hierarchy using a toti so i can see on which date which shop made how many sales with which sales sale id i can even see the sale id where this particular sale was performed apart from visualizing like this you can always click on this pivot table and you can see the line chart so i can see that on which shop sorry on which date which shop with which sale id performed how many sales you can see i can hover over the data points and i can see exact details of this data point i can always change this let us say i want date over quantity dot sum that on which date how many products were sold i can always see using this line chart and switch back to the pivot table and i can right click here and click on publish in app and i can actually see this web application which auto provides this is amazing because a totee provides you a web application where you can create a new dashboard or a new folder and you can even access this dashboard by writing session dot link shift enter and here is a link to the dashboard so anyway you can go to the dashboard you can simply right click and do publish in app and this particular thing will be published inside of your dashboard so let me do one thing let me create a new dashboard this is my first dashboard and i can you know go to my widgets and get this pivot table this particular table which i have published to the app so i can directly publish this to my dashboard that is the web application that roti provides you let me go to the home of the dashboard it wants me that your data is not saved now i can delete this dashboard and create new folders for multiple users let us say harry wants to use this dashboard and he can you know keep all his dashboards inside of this folder let us say lavish wants to use his dashboard he can simply put all his analysis inside of this folder and so on so let's say i want to create a new dashboard inside of harry folder i can simply say create new dashboard and i can even create more folders inside of my harry folder so this is something that you can do let us say i want to find a winning product for my sales data i want to see which product is performing the best i can always create a line chart and in my line chart what i can do is simply add uh on which date i can add product as well as unitprice.sum but i can see what the total worth or the sum of unit price of this particular product is also for this particular product or for this for instance we can see what the sum of unit prices so we we can have these kind of analysis inside of a total dashboard now if i give a title to this dashboard let us say a toti first dashboard and if i press enter this will actually save this dashboard so if i take you to the dashboard home uh if i take you inside of harry this actually saves this dashboard now once you have given a name to the folder you can simply share it with a lot of other people in your network you can host this dashboard inside of your network and you can give this link to your colleagues and peers and they can you know access your dashboard and access the same application so this is how you can share a total dashboards within a network or even host it on the internet you know if people have the proper access they will be able to access the dashboard now i can even go to the product and drag it to the widget filter and then click on advanced and i'll simply say that quantity dot sum uh is the highest and let us say i'll i want to keep five or six whose quantity dot sum is the maximum in my data if i apply the filter i'll be able to see that these are the five values and this is the average of these five values is the maximum this is the minimum so all these kind of insights can be drawn from the dashboard now if i drag this filter inside of the dashboard i can always say that i want to select the members of this state or let's say i want to select the members of this state as well as the you know this state as well as this state now since i have this advanced filter applied uh this thing is not working so i'll simply close this and if i add more dates now you know even more rows will be added to my data so i can apply this quick filter and this is also one of the things i like about it roti before we conclude this video i want to show you that you can even drill through this you know particular row and you'll see a lot more about this data so if i do drill through i can see on which date this particular bed was sold for how many quantities and so on so i hope you liked the 2t and you were able to understand all the kind of analysis that we did in this video i hope that this video was helpful for all of you if you like this video make sure you check out the description install it inside your system and try to analyze it using your data because if you analyze it on your data you are going to understand it even better because you understand your data you know better than anybody else so thank you so much guys for watching this video and i will see you next time

creating a wordpress website is super simple we all know that but in this video we are going to see how we can unlock the powers of elementor cloud why it is important and what kind of convenience does it give you over simple wordpress on a server or let us say elementor on a server we'll see what elementor cloud exactly is and why this is the wordpress of the future after this video you'll know what elementor cloud brings to the table will see all the features like free ssl free cloud fare free cdn and the blazing fast speed it offers a demo is 1000 words so we'll go to the computer screen and we'll start exploring elementor cloud now let's talk about what exactly is elementor cloud if you click the link in the description you'll go to this website which is from elementor cloud and this is something amazing it is a hosted wordpress website ready for you assume that you have to start with wordpress you will need a server you'll install wordpress on that server and again you will run into a lot of issues if you are a beginner or if you are somebody who has not deployed 1020 wordpress websites elementor is amazing we all know our good old elementor which is used to build websites and you can see this animation on the elementor page it clearly shows what elementor is capable of so this is the elementor website which shows you how you can use elementor cloud so elementor cloud is a cloud service from elementor which will include everything you need add a single place you will get the cdn you will get the hosted website on google cloud platform and since they are giving you the hosting definitely this is paid but again even if you are hosting wordpress on the server you will definitely spend at least 99 so in my opinion this is a great thing so i went ahead and bought this service for my next blog and i just wanted to share how i'm setting everything up now why use elementor you might ask elementor is something that i've been using since a very long time i am not a big fan of creating uh something which i have already created from scratch i can definitely write a blog in flask i can definitely write a blog in django and i sometimes do it purposefully but again when you want to get started quickly or if i want somebody to get started quickly my friend asked me hey honey can you build a website for me what is what i tell them is just go for wordpress go for element just start writing focus on what you need to focus on focus on the quality content focus on how and what you are writing not on building the entire website if that makes sense so you can simply click the link in the description and get started with elementor cloud so i'll quickly complete the purchase and get back so this is the home page that elementor cloud shows me once i've created a website this is the elementor cloud home page what i'll do is i'll click on the create cloud website to create my first elementor cloud website and i'll punch in the name my code blog now this name is completely random let me tell you you can always go to godaddy and what i recommend is you choose a name which might be available as a domain now what i mean by that is you can simply go to godaddy search for my code blog and if your domain is available well and good nothing can be better than that because you can always take this website to a serious level to a point where you are earning some money from this website and it is very much doable using wordpress let me tell you so if i choose my name as the codetips.com this domain is available so what i'll do is i'll change this to the code tips and i'll proceed clicking on next now your website domain will be this that's totally fine i'll click got it i'll go to the next step by clicking on next what kind of website are you creating i'm creating a blog so what i'll do is i'll simply choose blog from the list of options and click next that is giving me some templates this is amazing feature from elementor cloud they simply show you all the uh templates available so you don't have to tweak all the nuts and bolts so you don't have to start from scratch you can always choose a template i'm going to choose this one but before that i'm going to see what's inside now health and mindfulness blog is something that i already know about i'm already aware of this blog and what i'll do is simply use this template and after previewing it an ipad and mobile phone in different sort of devices i found out that this is the best template for my blog so what i'll do is simply use this template and proceed in order to proceed with this template all you need to do is simply click on start with this kit so i'll click here start with this kit and i will be proceeding it's taking some time let it take its time the time will definitely be worth it and yeah creating your wordpress site setting up your dashboard uh now i can tell you from my experience that this process takes a bit of time so allow it some time and it will definitely take you to your wordpress dashboard and you'll be very happy so let's give it some time i'll wait for this to finish up and be back very soon all right so this is how my website looks at this point liver balance life popular post shows nothing no problems recent health shows nothing no problems mindfulness also shows nothing that's not a problem at all because we are going to see how to make this work okay so what i'm doing is opening my wordpress dashboard in a new tab this is how it looks amazing fresh dashboard feeling what i'll do is i'll simply go to customize or rather edit with elementor so you don't have to remember all these options let me tell you you can simply look at the menu presented to you and that many will tell you what to do when to do how to do okay so uh what i'll do is i simply want some posts there there is another column here what i'll do is delete this particular column so i'm pressing the delete key and also what i'll do is simply click on this pencil and it shows me how many columns do you want so i'm selecting one now again let me do one thing what i'm doing is simply wanting all the popular posts to show up here okay so in order to do that what you need to do is go to query and simply you can include a term i'll remove this term i'll remove this term now what i've done is i have removed the term from here now what i'll do is i'll simply go to layout and i'll choose the number of post as five okay now five posts are going to show up here and i'll choose number of column as five now five posts will show up like this okay but there is another column here i want to get rid of this column so what i'll do is i'll right click on this column and i'll simply say delete so this is how my website will look now before updating if i was to show you my website i'll open it in a new tab and i want to show you one more setting which is site lock what i'll do is i'll simply copy this website i'll open an incognito tab i'll simply press enter and what you'll see is that this website is no longer accessible this is a feature this is not a bug let me tell you what is going to happen is elementor will say hey who is this who is trying to access this website if admin has given you the access tell me the pin code now where is the pin code your pin code is inside your elementor dashboard okay so if i scroll down i'll show you the pin code without even revealing the pin code i can copy it which is a good feature so if my friend is sitting beside me i don't have to show him the pin code i'll simply paste it and click continue and that person will be able to see the website now before i pressed update this is how the website looks after i press update button here i'll simply update it all the popular post will show up now who has written these blog posts this is something that elementor gave me out of the box so if i click here you will see let me reload this and once i reload all the popular post will show up i'm waiting for it to refresh it takes some time and yeah it shows all the post which is amazing this website looks good now so i can change this i can change the number of post here i can actually show a particular category let me show you how to do that i can simply scroll down and let us say i want to show all the post with category mindfulness i'll click here i'll go to query and after going to query what i'll do is i'll simply say i want to show only the post with category mindfulness okay let me simply search mindfulness and it will show me a dropbox oops mindfulness mindfulness okay i'll select this category now only the post with category mindfulness will show up here okay which is an amazing feature now i can do the same thing here i can do the same thing here i can create this website like a regular wordpress website let me press update and if i reload this website you will simply see that this particular section is updated now only post with category mindfulness are being shown okay this is coming from the template if i open this post you will see this post and amazing you get a free domain you get free ssl i think this is going to be a wordpress game changer amazing because you don't have to manage everything all you need to do is pay 99 or something to elementor uh and voila you have the website out there okay now you can change all these logo and all using a wordpress dashboard you can always click here and do all those things but again this is how you build a wordpress website using elementor cloud which is amazing now let's say i want to add a post let me add it uh where is my add new post it said i'll simply say how to build a wordpress website or something okay it's opening up and yeah so i'll say how to build a wordpress website and simply i'll say this is sorry this is how you build a wordpress website okay now i'll simply publish this post yes i want to publish it i know this doesn't look good but again let me publish it i'll reload this page and you will see that this post will show up somewhere uh okay so so this post is showing up here okay i don't have an image here so it is showing up like this if you will add an image it will show up like this okay this is amazing nice all right so this is the home page that is being shown to me by elementor i've built a website i've done everything now i'll show you the belts and whistles that elementor cloud offers so if you have a website or more than one websites they all will show up here now this is the site lock is on if i click on the code tips it will open this the code tips dot element cloud website for me this website is opening for me but the moment i open this website in an incognito tab this will start asking me a pin code and this is where sitelock comes in so the site lock simply says while you're developing your website nobody will be able to see your website anybody who has a pin code will still be able to see your website so if you are building your website or you are testing your website among few friends or among few teammates you can always turn the site lock on now if you click on manage this website you can always turn the site lock off which means that your website will be public so unlocking your site means that visitors and search engines can access your site so make sure whenever you are planning to go live you turn the site lock off for now i am not turning my site lock off i'll copy my pin code and i'll paste the pin code i'll click on continue and my website will be visible so i'm waiting for the website to load and you can see that my website is visible now let us say i want to edit a post on my website let us say i want to edit how to build a wordpress website i'll simply go to uh my wordpress dashboard so let me reload this uh i'll simply click on websites and open wp dashboard this will open my wp dashboard which is my wordpress dashboard waiting for my wordpress dashboard to open and you'll be able to do anything you are able to do in wordpress okay so if you open pages you can always add pages if you open post you can add a new post or you can edit existing post i am going to edit this one so i'll simply say edit and what i'll do is i'll simply add an image okay so i'll show you how to add an image so i'll click on this featured image select the featured image i'll go to media library and i'll choose this image let us say i'll choose a random one i'll click on set featured image now what will happen is the moment i update and reload my page the featured image will show up here as you can see so i can always add a new post this is something that you will do all the time adding a new post a new page is something that you will keep on adding because that's how your blog grows right you keep on adding the post and you keep on adding the content and the featured image and this is how your blog will get a lot of visitors now i'll show you something can you see this user six two seven two seven four ee zero three two one e i want to change this so i'll simply go to users and i'm going to edit this user so i'll click edit and i'll simply change this user something something nickname to harry and display name publicly as harry not this okay and i will update profile the moment i update profile and reload you'll see the name will be changed to harry here i'm waiting for this to reload and yeah so you'll definitely want your name to be uh something and not user xx yy zz something like that okay so the site lock is on what i'll do now is i'll turn off my site log so that everybody will be able to see my website so i'll do one thing i'll close the incognito tab and i'll go to my i simply clicked on manage this website by the way and i will simply turn off the site log sometimes if you're creating a new account it will ask you to confirm your email so you'll have to confirm your email before your site will go live i'll simply click on unlock site this takes some time and it is still showing me this loading if let me wait for the site to go live it takes some time a minute or something or 30 seconds so it took less than a minute and my site lock is off which means that i should be able to access my website so i'm clicking the domain provided by elementor cloud to me i'll open an incognito tab and i'll try to access this blog and it should load uh yeah it is loading so this elementor cloud basically provides you a lot of features and cdn is one of those so what cdn will do is it will make your website blazingly fast your website will be cached at different locations by different servers which actually speeds up your website and reduces loading time so you can always change this liver balance life you can always change the category of your blog you can always change all these categories health health health mindfulness i'll show you how to do that you can always do that in your wordpress dashboard you can go to post and then you can go to categories and you will be able to edit or add a new category okay so i'm waiting for this to load and so this is where you'll be able to change all the categories you can add a new category another thing that i like about elementor cloud is that they have dedicated wordpress support team and a dedicated team for you to set up elementor cloud so i was running into some issues to be honest when i was starting out because i didn't know where a particular setting is and these people actually helped me a lot so the support is great and i've not tried wordpress support to be honest but i assume this will be great since the support from their elementor cloud website is great so yeah this is how you set up a wordpress website using elementor cloud you can always add a custom domain when your blog reaches to a serious level i will suggest that you add a custom domain and adding a custom domain should be simple as well so they are simply saying that you go to your hosting and simply add these two records go to your domain provider and make sure your domain is updated with the cname or a record from your default elementor domain okay so if you add these two then you can add your custom domain and this should work and these things are super simple you just have to follow and uh their support will help you if you're not able to do that so this is great another feature is backups you can always take a backup you can export a backup you can restore your website to an original state and you don't have to pay anything extra for this so this is amazing and a lot of other features are yet to be explored by me i'm still using it let's see how it goes so this is my blog the codetips.elementor.cloud and i'm definitely going to buy a domain for this and set this up so let us change the site logo i'll simply click on this hamburger i'll go to site settings and after going to site settings it'll show me site identity i'll click on site identity and i'll simply choose a site logo let me keep this as a site logo i'll click on insert media and i'll do the same thing with site fab icon i'll say insert media i'll click on update it says your changes have been updated i'll click on back to editor and yeah i think my site logo and my fav icon should be there now let me reload this page so yeah it shows up here i can always click on edit header and i'll be able to edit my header but again if you see this page you'll see that the site logo is here and the site fab icon is here amazing good stuff so i hope that you were able to understand how elementor works and why is it a very good and secure alternative to hosting wordpress on your server or some other hosting platform so this is something which is great and i'll simply close the dashboard now i'll simply double check if my website is working i'll click on my code tips and you'll see how speedy your website gets once it is visited by some number of users you can see that this website is super fast i'll click on this blog post and this blog post will be loaded yes it does and again i'll go to the home page and i'll go to this page and yeah this works amazing good stuff i have not edited the content by the way but you can always add the content and you can share this on facebook you can share this on twitter this theme gives me everything so you cannot focus directly on your content you can focus on writing good blog post and the rest everything will be taken care of by elementor now before we go what i want to do is i'm going to show you how backup works in element so i'll simply click on manage this website and let us try to explore all the features from elementor cloud what i'll do is i'll scroll down and i'll simply try to restore my website to the point when it was 5th may 2022-73 so let me click on restore it will tell me i understand my website will be unavailable until restore is complete that makes sense i understand that site management and editing will not be available i understand that visitors to my site will view a site down message from elementor no problems i'll simply click on yes restore and it will restore my site now i'll tell you something so when your site is backed by a cdn it will be cached at different locations let me make a google search on cdn i'll find some image so what basically happens is throughout the world there are different regions where cdn will be having its servers so let us say this is the cdn server one this is cdn server two three four and so on practically there will be a lot of cdn servers so your website will be cached so let us say somebody is asking for a blog post where you have written about how to lose weight in 10 days something like that so what will happen is your page will be served by the cd and it will not go to your actual server actual database it will simply serve you the cached content so even if your site is down due to this restore it will actually not impact your visitors it will not have any significant impact on the people visiting your website so it is definitely taking some time so i'll give it its time honestly speaking that was pretty fast within a minute i was able to restore my website let me see how my website looks before i even think of doing something so the post that was added to my website is no longer available here because i have restored my website even the site logo that we added has been disappeared because we had not at that time added the site logo which totally makes sense and let us now try to explore more options so this is the url of my site elementor cloud website hosted it gives me the id and managed domain instruments are the addresses visitors use okay that makes sense it gives you a free ssl which means you don't have to worry about buying an actual ssl certificate and you can add custom domains which is great there is a record it tells me that your data center is in belgium not a problem because i'm anyway using cdn now sitelock i already told you about that backups we actually took one just a minute back now this is debugging and troubleshooting panel which i don't think a lot of you will be using because again you'll not be debugging wordpress errors a lot when you're working with elementor cloud and even if you run into some problem what i recommend is talk to these people don't try to randomly do stuff on your website because you might break things up simply go to the wordpress support or the the better option is go to backups and simply restore your website to say three days back or four days back and manually add all those posts up if that makes sense and if you're trying to do something magical installing say 10 plugins 20 plugins all of a sudden what i recommend is simply click on create a new backup and let me let me simply type imp this is an important backup so i'll say imp this is my important backup so it will take the backup this will take some time and we'll take the backup for you and now you can try experimenting the you know adding plugins doing some stuff which you think might break your website up you can try all those things and if even if it breaks your website you can always come back to this imp backup and restore your website it's pretty simple so in my opinion elementor cloud saves a lot of time but again i'm still using it and let's see how it goes anyway it's a new product from elementor my backup is complete and i should be able to see the backup here which is great i mean this is amazing i can even export my backup i think it will give me some file to download export okay so it just gave me a notification soon you will receive an email with the download link wow so nobody can steal your data by logging into your uh elementor cloud dashboard this is also great i mean i like it so yeah so that was all about elementor cloud so you can definitely go ahead try the link in the description and start using elementor cloud if you haven't already and without any doubt you can definitely purchase this you will never regret it i can tell you if you are anywhere trying to use wordpress go for elementor cloud because anyway you are going to spend this amount of money on a hosting it's better to do that on elementor cloud because you get all these bunch of amazing options so that was all about the video thank you so much guys for watching this video and i will see you next time [Music] you,TRUE

that i'll also be supplying you two formats of the cheat sheets the first one is the pdf format and the other one is the web format so that all the commands that you want to use in html is a single

to do in this course can be added to your github profile feel free to add all these projects to your github profiles and they will definitely enhance your portfolio so enough of talks now let's get started so i have written some handwritten notes in the form of five chapters for you and all these notes are going to help you a lot when it comes to revising html and even when it comes with understanding this is going to help you a lot believe me so this is the chapter number zero which gives you the basic introduction of what html is why html is needed and what css and javascript has to do when it comes to web pages and websites so let's get started with html what exactly is html html stands for hyper text markup language it is a language of the web it is something that you need to you know get your websites up and running it is used to create websites we use html text to define look and feel of a website so when you open youtube.com or when you open github.com or any other website for that matter that website looks the way it looks just because of the html it is rendering this website looks this way just because of the html it is rendering then what is the role of css and javascript should be the question that you might ask so let's let's take all of these one by one so we use html tags to define look and feel of a website what exactly is an html tag let me show you something let us say you have this website or any website for that matter if you right click and click on view page source you'll see the source of that website that source is nothing but the html code of that website the moment you go to the source code of some website you'll see these kind of tags now we'll look into all these tags one by one very soon but this is html this is something that you need to know this stack this a tag this p tag this li tag this ul tag all these tags are nothing but part of this html document okay now then why it's css and javascript you must be thinking that if html can get the job done why do we need css and javascript yes html can get the job done it can give you a basic web page it can give you a very basic layout but again if you want to design the layout if you want to make it look good you need css css is used to design a web page now okay so we have the web page we have the design of the web page we should be good right html for layout of the web page and css for the design of webpage why do we need javascript then should be your next question and this is what i'm going to answer now so html is used for defining the layout of a page a bare bone page structure so html simply tells that here there is something which is going to be an image here another image is going to come here some heading is going to come then another heading is going to come then some input tag is going to come now css will decide where this input tag will be aligned with the spec to the web page where this particular portion of the website will be aligned with respect to the web page which heading is going to appear before which heading all these things can be controlled using css also the background color of a page the color of the text and the font of the text the font size of the text all these things can be controlled using css so css is used to add styling to the bare bone page which was created using html so i hope that the role of css and html are clear to you html for the bare bones css for designing and defining how a particular page looks okay so we have the bare bones we have the designing what about javascript why do we even need javascript should be your next question so javascript is used to program logic for the page layout what does this mean this means that javascript is going to control what happens when a user hovers on a text what will happen when somebody clicks on a link what will happen when somebody selects a piece of text what will happen when somebody say right clicks or say clicks on something or say brings their mouse inside of a box so all these things can be controlled using javascript so javascript is used to program the client-side logic of the page so html for the bare bones css for the styling and javascript for the client-side logic what is client-side logic client side logic is simply what happens when a user interacts with the page so you can define what happens when somebody clicks on a button you can define what happens when somebody takes their mouse uh over to this particular heading and so on we'll learn about all these things let's now learn about these things using a very beautiful analogy so you can consider html as a car body assuming you own a car you must be having a metallic portion of the car which is nothing but the body exclude the engine exclude the seats exclude the color exclude all the designing which has been uh you know tailor-made for your car just remove all those things and your bare bones just the metallic body of your car can be you know looked upon as html if i add css to your car you can add paint decoration etc and your car is now designed so i can say that css has been added to your car what about javascript javascript is brain of your car it will logically define what happens when somebody sits inside the car what happens when somebody interacts with the car and this will comprise of car engine the logic of the interior the logic of the mid and all those things so this is a very good analogy that i think is very very beneficial when it comes to understanding what is the role of html css and javascript so html is the body of the car css is the paint decoration and other styles that is added to the car and javascript is the engine and the interior logic of the car so we start learning how to build beautiful layouts in this course we look into all the aspects of this particular thing which is html and we'll also look into how we can write html so that our web pages are seo friendly but before that we are going to install an ide comes source code editor which is visual studio code so we can use any text editor of our choice there is no compulsion you don't have to use visual studio code but i'm going to use visual studio code because it is lightweight it is open source and it is from microsoft and it is cool believe me so we'll go to google we'll type visual studio code so i'll say install vs code and [Music] head over to this website click on windows linux or whatever operating system you are in uh i'll click on windows because i'm on windows and an installer will get downloaded to my machine so vs code user setup.exe this particular installer is downloaded to my machine i'll wait for it to download and then i'll click on it and wait for it to install i will simply read the license agreement and then i'll simply click on i accept the agreement next next wait i want to check all these boxes make sure that you have all these boxes checked and then simply click on next then once again install and give it give it the time it needs and it is going to install visual studio code on your computer i'll wait for some time and visual studio code will be installed very soon on my machine as you can see visual studio code has been installed i don't want to launch it just yet i'll simply click finish if you have installed visual studio code just like i did you'll be able to open visual studio code inside a given folder now what i mean by that is you can simply go to a folder and you can simply right click and you can click on this open with code at the moment you do that this particular folder will be opened inside your visual studio code so you can see that my visual studio code shows these three files and this particular folder also shows these three files which means that the files which i see here and files which i see here are exactly the same and this folder has been opened inside my visual studio code we'll now move on to chapter number one and we'll see some important concepts of html in great detail so let's move on to chapter number one now so this is a pdf of chapter number one which i've created for you let me open this pdf in chrome uh so this is a chapter and we are going to create a first website in this chapter yes you heard that right so let us understand how we can create a basic website using html so we start building a website by creating a file named index.html now index.html is a special file name which is presented when the website root address is typed what does that mean let me explain it to you so what i'll do is i'll come to this chapter and inside this folder i'll simply right click and click on open with code what that will do is that will open this particular folder inside visual studio code for me so the folder which is being shown here these two files from this particular folder and these two files inside of my visual studio code are representing the same files from this folder which means that i am capable of opening this folder inside visual studio code let me show you something i'll create a new file by clicking on this icon and i'll say index.html i can also create a folder by clicking on this particular icon this is for creating a new folder this is for creating a new file at this moment what i've done is i've created a new file which is index.html if i show you this folder you'll see that index.html is also reflected here so index.html here and index.html inside visual studio code are representing the same thing i'll show you something simply press shift on your keyboard and press one so uh if you press that what will happen is you will see an exclamation mark and you will see this particular drop down this is nothing but emit abbreviation emit abbreviation means that it is going to print the boilerplate code for you so let me choose this first option and it will magically give me the boilerplate code that i need for this particular website now what does this mean what does this boilerplate code mean so there is some piece of code which all of my web pages are going to need this is the code that i'll require when i'm creating a basic html website now this has a title this has a body this has some meta tags now if you are new to html you might think that what what are these types of tags and why do i need all these tags do i need to remember this the answer is no you don't have to remember this all you need to remember is that in order to get this in visual studio code all you need is an exclamation mark and you have to press and enter key and that's going to do all the magic for you now if i press tab and if i change the title to programming with harry and if i press ctrl s what will happen is this will change the page title to programming with harry now i'll simply type i am page body here and after doing that what i'll do is i'll go to my extensions so you can click here to go to your extensions and install an extension called live server so live server is an extension which simply allows you to open a web page live in your browser what does that mean let me explain it to you so what i'm going to do is i'm going to install this in your case you will see this install button here simply click on that install button and live server will get installed and the moment you do that maybe you might have to restart your visual studio code in some cases but in most of the cases you're going to see an option of open with live server so the moment you right click on this page inside your index.html you will see an option open with live server click on this option and the moment you do that you will see this page open inside your google chrome or whichever is your default browser okay in my case it is google chrome now you can see that the title of the page is programming with harry and the body is here i am page body what if i change this i am page body to i am page body and description what if i do something like this this will automatically get updated here which is done by live server here i i don't have to refresh it all the time which is why i have installed live server chrome extension let's now try to understand what all these tags are about what is the stock type html what is this html tag what is this head tag what is this meta why do we have three meta tags let's try to understand all these things so inside your basic html page the very first line that we have is the doctype html this line specifies that this is an html5 document now back in the day we used to have html documents html5 is a new specification and this particular line at the top of your html page simply declares this page as an html5 document html tag is the root of an html page and whenever we have an opening tag we have a closing tag as well so i'll show you something i'll simply click here and i'll say full screen snap and i'm going to make a point by doing this so do you see this html tag the closing tag corresponding to this particular tag is this so html is opened here and html is closed there did you notice that the html tag is opened by writing html inside the angular brackets and it is closed by writing the same html inside the angular bracket except the fact that it starts with a forward slash so this is the closing tag this is the opening tag and inside the opening tag and closing tag is my html document same goes for head as well the head is opened here and head is closed here so this is the closing tag for head same goes for title as well the opening tag for title is there the closing tag for title is here same goes for body as well the opening tag of body is here closing tag of body is here so corresponding to almost all the text in html we have an opening tag and closing tag but there are some of the tags which do not require opening and closing tag and we are going to learn about those tags in the future but for now just keep this in your mind that whenever you have a tag you have an opening tag you have a closing tag and between these opening and closing tags lies some of more html of your page okay so in this case inside my body i have this h1 opening tag and h1 closing tag p opening tag p closing tag and inside this p opening tag and p closing tag is my paragraph so corresponding to almost all the tags there is an opening tag and a closing tag and between opening and closing tag lies some html okay so i'll close this snip and i'll come back to nodes so html is the root of an html document whatever you see inside your browser it includes the title it includes the body it includes the header footer whatever you see will be enclosed inside your html so html marks the start of your document i'm talking about this html tag this particular tag marks the start of your html document marks the start of your web page now let's talk about head head is something that is uh that includes the title it includes some meta information what is meta information meta tags means information about information for example this page might have a meta tag called description associated with it and this description will be used by search engine to you know display the content of the page when you search so i'll show you something let us say if i search javascript you'll see this particular text did you see this particular text search engines might use this particular text out of your meta description tag so if you write your meta description tags properly search engines are going to be happy with your websites okay so this is about the meta tag i have this meta tag here but i don't have metadata inside of here meta tags are not essential your page will still work if you don't have meta tags let's talk about the title title is the page title it's really very important because this marks the title of your page what your page is about is really very important for the users and you should write your title text very nicely okay now this particular closing head tag marks the closure of my head tag and from here starts the body of my pages now body of the page is something which which is displayed below this line did you see this line this particular thing this thing is the body of the page so whatever i see here will be the body of my web page okay now body might have a heading it might have a paragraph there are a lot of tags that i'm going to discuss in this course and you can use all those tags to write paragraph to write lists to write different types of headings and so on we are going to talk in depth about all these things okay and this marks the closing of body tag and this marks the closing of html tag so i hope you got an idea of how these things are working how html works how opening and closing tag works and how title body and all these things work inside a web page so a tag is like a container for either content or other html tags for example if you see this html document this html document will be received by the browser and this browser will render it inside of your computer screen so whatever you see inside your google chrome is something that is done by the browser the browser in reality accepts the html code so if you see this page this is not what this browser received this browser received this thing and your browser is smart enough to convert this code into this beautiful looking page so this is how html is passed by the browser so html document is received by the browser and that particular html code is rendered like this by your browser okay so this is how html document works there are a few important notes that i want to talk about here head and body tags are children of html tag so html contains the entire webpage which is why head and body are children of html html is the parent of head and body tags now since head and body are children of html html is the parent of head and body that that totally makes sense right now most of the html elements have opening and closing tags with content between opening and closing tags this is also very evident we have seen this now some html tags have no content and these are called empty elements now there is an example of empty element which is br which is used to create a new line after a heading or paragraph we can either use dot html or dot html extension with our web pages so it's not mandatory that you have to use dot html as the extension of your web page you might even use dot htm as your page extension if you are using html now you can use inspect element of view page source option from chrome to look into a website's html code this is also important all you need to do is you need to right click click on inspect and you will see all the code which has resulted into this page the code that browser has actually passed in order to display this page to you will be seen here okay i hope that makes sense as well now html element is nothing but starting tag plus content and ending tag so html when i say html element what i mean is i'm talking about the starting tag i'm talking about the content inside the starting diagram indeed and i'm talking about the ending tag so if i'm talking about head element i'm talking about this entire thing in this case if i'm talking about head i'm head element i'm talking about this okay so this is something that you need to take care um when you're talking about the html elements okay comments in html what is what is a comment so sometimes you might want to write something inside your source code which you don't want your browser to pass but the sad truth is that whatever you write here is going to be passed by the browser so if i say hey browser please don't parse this okay if i do something like this browser is not going to listen because it's not a human being it's going to show me this so in order to make this browser not pass this and completely ignore this i can actually write something called comment i simply pressed control plus forward slash inside my keyboard and i can toggle a comment so if i press control plus forward slash this particular thing will surround whatever i am selecting and this will be marked as a comment in html okay so in order to mark something as a comment in html all you need to do is angle bracket exclamation mark double dash and you have to close it like this double dash and closing angular bracket that's about it and you have a comment in html now if i show you the browser and if i reload this uh i think i forgot to save i'll save this so make sure that you save your file as well so the moment you save you'll see that this is not being passed by the browser anymore but if i show you the source code it will be there in the source code so if i zoom in you'll see that hey browser please don't parse this is inside my source code so make sure that you are not writing any confidential information inside the comments because your users will still be able to press right click and go to view page source and they are going to definitely see whatever comment you have inside your web page okay so i hope that makes sense let's now talk about case sensitivity is html a case sensitive language no it is not it is a case in sensitive language what is the case in sensitive language a case in sensitive language is a language where the upper case lower case or any other case doesn't matter when you're using the tags what does that mean so i can either say body or i can do something like this capital b or d y this will still work so if i do something like this this will still work i'll show you so if i reload this page this page will still work and if i go to the page source the capital body works capital head will also work capital title will also work and so on so i hope that you understood why html is a case sensitive language it works whatever be the case of your tags it can be uppercase it can be lowercase and so on so enough of theory about html let's now move into the chapter one practice set and solve some problems let's move on to chapter one practice set now so i'm back with chapter one practice set and here is a first question which we are going to solve and it says inspect your favorite website and change something on the page which is displayed so all we need to do here is to go to a website it can be anything i'm going to go to code withari.com and i'm going to open it now what i'm going to do is i'm going to right click here and i'll go to view page source so as you can see that i have compressed the html uh on my website i'm using angular universal to pre-render it you must be an html beginner and must be wondering what i'm saying but this is a very regular html page you can see what the content of the page is so here is the content of the page all the content of the page is visible here and this is a first website that we uh kind of inspected okay you can go to another website we can go to google fonts and we can inspect it so all i want from you is to go to the website have a look at the source code and try to understand why things are structured the way they are so this is our first exercise from chapter one practice it now the question number two says that go to your favorite website and try to view the page source and write the exact lines of code does it clone the website will copying the source code of fonts.google.com create a replica fonts.google.com is the question let's try to answer the question so what i'll do is i'll press ctrl a on my keyboard and i'll press ctrl c ctrl a for select all ctrl c for copy and now let's open vs code here so this is the index dot html now what i'll do is i'll say 0 1 underscore pr01.html and let me paste the source code i'll tell you something if you right click here you can see that there are only four lines and these lines are way too long okay which is why you are seeing it like this i'll show you how you can view the source code because this is not how you can conveniently view the source code there are two options the first option is go to the command palette in vs code and type word wrap world wrap i want to toggle word wrap so if you go to view toggle word wrap and if you select this option what vs code will do for you is it will display the entire line within this width it is not changing the way code is written i have not altered the file my file is the same the way i'm viewing it has changed previously i was allowing my lines to overflow from this vs code view container but now what i'm saying is i'm telling vs code hey please show me all these lines such that i can see them okay this is how i'm viewing my source code there is another way i can use there is another way i can use i can turn off the word wrap so i can go to command palette i can select this option to turn off the word wrap basically the code is the same except the fact that now the way i'm doing the code has changed i'm not viewing a line within this viewport the line is overflowing okay i hope you understood this now what i'll do is i'll right click and select this option format document this will actually change the way the code is structured so if i click on format document you can see previously there were only four lines there are now 351 lines but what vs code has done for me is it has changed the way the code was structured so it has basically formatted the code for me which is what i wanted okay so this is how vs code works the code has been formatted for me and now what i'll do is i'll right click i'll click on open with live server and you can see that unfortunately this page doesn't exist google fonts did it late the replica of the website no it did not why was that the case because this website is actually communicating with a lot of other css a lot of other apis maybe i'm not not allowed to access the api from this particular server that is a topic for another day but if you simply copy the html of a page and you try to paste it inside a file or rather a dot html file you are not going to see the replica of the website it's not that easy you can definitely clone a website to some extent it's possible but you cannot do something like this and have another clone of google fonts this is not possible this is what the question was about so did it clone the website no why because i might not have the access of some of the relative paths i might not have the access of some of the apis i might not be allowed to say access some other stuff from localhost a lot of things might be the reason but the answer is no and this is why you cannot clone a website like this write any html code inside a text file does it work if you write it using notepad so so far we have used visual studio code let me do something for you i'll open this folder i'll go to new text document i'll say notepad dot html i want to change the extension and it will give me a warning that hey you are changing the txt extension to dot html do you want to proceed was it something that you intended it will ask me all these things so it's basically telling me that this file might become unstable because you are changing the format so i'll say yes i know what i'm doing so let me do it now i'll open this particular file with notepad so you can always open dot html file using notepad so let me search for notepad i can't see notepad it's here okay so i have opened this file in notepad now what i'll do is i'll simply write html i'll write head and back in the day when there was uh or other i should say be your studio code and other source code editors like this were not as popular as they are today people used to write code like this okay or or i can safely say that back in the days of early computers uh early computing days 90s 80s people used to write code like this they were mainframe screens there were no operating systems like linux windows or mac but um it's it's an amazing time to live uh title and i'll say this is page title and i'll simply say title and html head title then i close the head tag i'll start the body tag i know you must be thinking what is this guy doing why is he typing everything i just want to show you that even if you type using notepad it's going to work so i'll say it works and i'll save it i just pressed ctrl s notepad.html has been saved i'll open this file in chrome and you can see that it works if i go to view page source i'll see all the source code does it work with live server as well yes it doesn't matter how the file was written if it is written and structured in a way that browser can understand it will definitely work so this is how um you know this works so doing this and doing this is a bit different here we are using a server here we are simply opening the file uh using our browser so you can see that file if you see here file is written and if you see here it's kind of a website for the browser so it's simply a file designing in our computer but if you use the server you will you'll get a lot of advantages that you'll know about in the future we'll always use live server when we are writing html css in javascript so yeah that was about chapter one practice set i hope you understood what the take away of chapter one practice set was uh we'll move on to chapter two now and we will start coding some beautiful websites and we'll try to get more understanding of html let's move on to chapter two now so here is a pdf of chapter two and let us now talk about some of the basic html tags we can add elements inside the body tag to define the page layout is something that we all know by now but which stack to use when is one of the most important questions and we are going to answer that in this chapter so let's do one thing let's go to this folder and open this folder in visual studio code i have opened this folder in vs code and i'm going to create a file called zero one underscore pr01 uh not pr0101 underscore uh structure.ht,TRUE

as the mother of all programming languages in fact a lot of compilers and jvms are written in C whenever it comes to programming C language is considered as the best to learn for beginners my name is Harry and I will be your instructor throughout this course we'll start from the basics of C in fact from the basics of programming and then we'll raise the bar like anything we learn about pointers we learn about functions we learn about Dynamics memory allocation which is one of the most confused topics when it comes to C the only prerequisite of this course is your time I just want you to come here devote some of your time to this course and definitely you will learn and master see like anything if you want to support this initiative make sure you hit the like button and also give me a comment saying this C language course is helpful that would mean a lot to me I have divided this course into different chapters each chapter has its own practice set which makes makes it easy for you to practice about the topic discussed in that chapter to make learning fun and simple I have also included some projects for you and one of the projects we are going to do in this course is a very interesting game and you'll definitely enjoy it when I started learning C I was really very confused with the syntax in fact the concept of pointer was something I was not able to wrap around my head but there were some of the tips and tricks that I used and some of the very amazing analogies which helped me learn C in a very very beautiful way this chapter consists of handwritten notes which are made by me I have used different colors in the notes I have written each and every chapter in The Practice set of the note to make things easier for you not only that I have also included a cheat sheet with this course so that after you are done with the course you have the boilerplate syntax and all the syntax that you want to use in your C programs is single click away I'll give you a link to the online and the PDF cheat sheet along with the cheat sheet and notes I have also timestamped this video so that you can easily navigate to the different chapters and you can easily learn C programming language the projects that we are going to do in this course can be added to your GitHub profile to enhance your portfolio do not forget to add them to your GitHub profile so enough of talks now let's get started so I am inside my computer screen let me be very honest with you guys this course is very very beautifully structured I have created notes for all the chapters and we have around 11 chapters in two projects and this is going to be fun so let's open chapter number zero where I'm going to give you introduction on what exactly C programming is and what exactly programming in general is because if this is your first language and you have not seen programming or maybe you haven't written any program in the past this course is going to be the starting point so what is programming computer programming is a medium for us to communicate with computers so just like me and you are communicating we are communicating with the help of a language which is English I'm using English language to express my feelings to you I'm using some English words which you can understand and take actions on for example if I say please come here you can come here if I say please go to the market you will go to the market and all those things so we have a computer and computer can be a desktop computer a laptop computer and I even call this phone as a computer this is also a mini computer so we can give instructions to the computer it can be of any form it can be a chip of this size or a phone of this size or a laptop of this size IR respective of what your computer is you need a medium to talk to the hardware and that Medium is programming so programming can be seen as a medium for us to communicate with computers just like we use Hindi or English to communicate with each other programming is a way for us to deliver instructions to the computer you might use Spanish you might use Dutch you might use some other language irrespective of what language you are using you are simply using it as a medium to communicate with the other person just like that we use C programming language to communicate with our computers so what is c c is a programming language it is one of the oldest programming languages it is called mother of all programming languages for a reason a lot of jvms and compilers are written in C operating systems are written in C A lot of lowlevel stuff is written in C so C is one of the most important programming languages and this is said to be a programming language which all the computer Enthusiast and computer software Engineers must learn so C is one of the oldest and finest programming languages he was developed by Dennis Richie at AT&T's Bell Laboratories in 1972 you don't have to remember this I remember this just because I've seen or read this statement a lot of times but you don't have to remember this but remember the name of Dennis Richie he indeed brought a revolution to the world of programming now let us talk about about the uses of C what exactly are the uses of C where would you want to use C programming language so C language is used to program a wide variety of systems some of the use cases are major operating systems Linux and there are a lot of other Linux distributions which are written in C so we use C to write an operating system which controls all the hardware of our machine so C is a very important language now let's talk about driver program C is also used to write driver program s let us say I have a device it's a camera it can be a printer it can be uh it can be a chip I can write device driver software using C programming language now C programming language is also used to program embedded systems where programs need to run faster and limited memory see there are a lot of programming languages in the market we have python we have Java we have JavaScript all these programming languages are good for one task or the other C is good and C is is famous to run faster in limited memory and wherever we have limited memory wherever we have embedded systems a microwave a very small chip something that needs to run in milliseconds is written in C now C is something that is very very close to the hardware and it is one of the most loved Language by those people who want to have a lot of controls in hand now C is also used to develop games an area where latency is very very important if you have played pubg or GTA y City GTA San Andreas GTA 5 cyber Punk we all play games right we all play one or the other game in our phones sometimes the latency is really very important especially in the case when we have limited Hardware in memory when we have limited Hardware limited amount of memory latency is really very important can you imagine you are pushing a button and that button is kicking somebody in your game and that kicks actually takes place seconds after you press the button you'll not play that game you'll not enjoy that game so latency is really very important in such games and C language is used to develop such games it really reduces the latency and C is an amazing language so we will start writing our first program in the next chapter we'll see the building blocks of a c program we'll see how C program is structured and how it looks and why we need to follow some of the best practices we'll see all those things in the next chapter let's move on to chapter one now let's start start with the first chapter and let's open this PDF I have written this PDF with a lot of hard work so please listen to whatever I'm telling you in this video very very carefully and definitely you will become a champion of C within no time uh let's now install a software called vs code you must be wondering what vs code is if you are a beginner but just follow along and see how I'm downloading and installing Visual Studio code you just have to download it I'm downloading it for Windows because I'm using Windows if you're using Mac Linux or some other operating system it should be available for your operating system it's very famous and it is really very good and fast so I'll simply install this vs code by clicking on this it is going to take 10 more seconds in my machine Visual Studio code has been installed so I'll run it I'll simply click next but I'll not be able to click next until I read this license agreement I've read the license agreement I'll click on accept the license agreement I'll go to next and make sure that these check boxes are checked this is very important and I'll tell you why later but make sure that all all these checkboxes are checked you might want to create a desktop icon if you want to create you can check it otherwise not but these other checkboxes must be checked I'll tell you why after some time let's click on next let's click on install and this is going to install Visual Studio code on my machine so I'll wait for it to install and in the meantime what I'll do is I'll say download MW now what is this MW it's a compiler that we are going to use and this is something that will help us Runner C programs I'll tell you how and why later but let's download it and let's set up MW in our machine so all you have to do is simply click on this download button and your download will start shortly I'm waiting for it to download this is simply gnu for Windows it's GCC which is used to compile C programs you can see your Chrome downloads by clicking here and clicking on downloads and after you do that you will see that MW get setup.exe this has been downloaded so I'll run it I'll simp simply click on install uh this is the directory where I want my MW to get installed if you don't want to get it installed here you can install it in program files or something but I'll not touch it I'll simply go to continue and this is downloading the installation manager this takes some time let me be very honest with you I'm using quite fast internet connection still it takes some time so give it its time you can go grab a cup of coffee or maybe you can go for lunch or dinner and come back and this will be downloaded but yeah it is downloading quite fast f it depends upon the source for servers to be very honest sometimes it's fast sometimes it's slow but again irrespective of whatever the case is you can grab a cup of coffee so I'll give it its time and in the meantime I'll look into Visual Studio code but I'll not launch Visual Studio code from here and I'll tell you why I'll simply uncheck this check box and I'll click on finish and what I'll do is I'll come back to this folder where I've created all the notes for you I'll come back to this chapter one folder and what I'll do is I'll right click and and I'll see this option open with code in a very very rare case if you do not see this options after following the steps that I mentioned you can restart your computer but in most of the cases you should and you will definitely see this option open with code simply click on open with code and once you do that this folder will be opened in Visual Studio code now what does this mean when I say that this folder will be opened in Visual Studio code this simply means that I have this Visual Studio code source code editor and all the files that I'll create here will reflect here and vice versa so if I create a new folder here I'll see it here and if I create a new folder by clicking here let me call it new folder 2 I'll see it here as well so I can look into all the files delete read write all the files from here itself so this is one of the biggest advantages of Visual Studio code I simply selected it and pressed delete on my keyboard and this actually deleted all those folders that I didn't need it now what I do is I'll simply click on this plus icon and I'll say 01 uncore basic. C and this will actually create a file now what is this do c and what does this program name mean let me tell you so when I say 01 basic. C it actually creates a C file a c source code file just like we save our PDFs with an extension of PDF just like we save our text files with an extension of txt just like we save our movie files with an extension of MP4 we save our C source code files using C now what I'll do is I'll come back to visual studio code and this will look very very haunting to you if you are opening it for the first time you might get confused what these buttons are about you might get confused what the setting is about and let me tell you how this Visual Studio code has been customized for my case now you will see some other color in your Visual Studio code and that might bother some of the students so let me tell you that you can actually install a jellyfish theme extension simply type jellyfish themes after clicking on this extensions button so I'll say jellyfish theme or other themes if I'm not wrong uh I think it's theme jellyfish theme and I already have jellyfish theme installed um maybe I'm not spelling it correctly let me find it out jellyfish jellyfish theme yeah so it's jellyfish theme it's said so simply search for this jellyfish theme install and you should also see this color theme another thing that I'm using is cc++ intellisense so you can click on install you will see this install button for my case it has already been installed so I'm not going to reinstall it you can click on this install button and this will be installed so uh for the time being we'll use these two extensions I have some other extensions too which I have uh enabled for other projects but I'll disable them immediately so let me disable all these uh Community material theme so I usually work with a lot of extensions with a lot of other languages so what I'll do is I'll simply uh disable all these extensions so I have disabled GitHub markdown so let me disable all these things which we do not need here and which might confuse you you don't have to install and disable all these extensions let me tell you I'm disabling it because I don't want them to disturb me while I'm coding in C with you so let me reload my vs code I'll simply click on reload U and that should do now what I'll do is I'll simply create a boiler plate C code and for that what I'll do is I'll open uh my C cheat sheet and I'll give you the link of my C cheat sheet from the description uh so let me open the C language cheat sheet I'll copy this code I'll paste this code I'll save and what I'll do is I'll simply say print F and I'll say hello word now you must be thinking what have I written in here I haven't explained anything here and I have written all these things without even explaining this is unfair but again you just have to type this without understanding yes without understanding what it means because we are going to look and desect into all these things in the rest of this video so do not worry and type this as is you can copy the boiler plate from here I'll give you the link of the street sheet as well and also what I'll do is I'll see if this has been completed so I'll click on on continue and all you need to do is you need to click on this minw 32 GCC g++ and I'll mark this for installation just click and click on Mark for installation and this is a C++ compiler and C++ compiler as well as a c compiler because we have GCC g++ so just install it I'll go for installation and I'll say apply changes and I'll say apply and this will actually download this and install it it sometimes gets very very annoying when the server is slow and it takes a lot of time so let me warn you beforehand do not cancel it it sometimes takes a very long amount of time and yes it is annoying but again it's worth it just go for a cup of coffee or go for lunch or dinner and you'll definitely love it when you come back and see everything you know getting installed and uh set up for you so I'll also do the same let me go and grab a glass of water and I'll come back after I have all this installed and set up on my machine so finally this has been completed and let me tell you guys this took a lot of time lot of time and my computer is fast and internet is fast so let me close this dialogue box and we have installed MW GCC g++ now see how we can use it so what I'll do is I'll go to my local DC and I'll go to the folder where this m GW has been installed I'll go to bin and I'll simply copy this path now what I'll do is I'll type en EnV and I'll be able to edit my system environment variables and and I'll click on environment variables then I'll click on path then I'll edit the path I'll add A New Path I'll paste this path and I'll click okay and then I'll simply click okay once again and once again and that will actually add GCC uh gc. exe this thing to path so basically what I want to do is I want to use this GCC exe to compile my C programs and because of that what I've done is I've added this folder this particular folder to path what happens when you add add a location to path basically you will be able to use all the txe executables without having to navigate to this path so let me show you I'll close this and what I'll do is I'll open my windows poell and I'll simply say GCC now the moment I enter you can see that no input files message has been provided to me it is basically telling me that you have not given me any source file to compile so let's come to visual studio code and see how we can compile our source files so so I'll close this terminal and you can open the terminal by clicking here terminal new terminal this actually opens a new terminal and you can say GCC 01 basic. C so once you type this you are basically saying compile this program which is written inside this source file 01 basic. C so you want to compile this file to a file which can be executed by this machine this machine is a Windows machine so it will compile it to aexe file let's see the moment I press enter you'll see an a.exe file created here now I can run this a.exe file I'll simply say a and press tab this actually autocompletes the moment you say a so anything that starts with a will get autocom completed so I'll simply say a and then I'll press tab or I can even type this particular thing dot back/ a.exe the moment I press enter I'm seeing this hello word so this program basically prints hello word I can even say hello Harry let me show you and back sln is nothing but a new line character so it actually prints a new line character because of which we are seeing this PSD this thing here instead of here so if I if I skip this back sln what what will happen is let me compile it once again and then once again I'll say/ a.exe the moment I say hello Harry this will actually not print a new line so let me show you a practical example of what this back slash n is doing so the moment I run this program once again you'll see that hello Harry a new line and then hello Harry but if I skip this back sln and once again I I'll compile this and I'll run this you'll see that there is no new line after Harry so what I'm doing is I'm using my arrow keys to compile my program once again and execute my program once again so you'll have to compile every time you make a change to your program this is something that you need to remember I hope that I'm clear I hope that all these things are clear in fact this is not clear so far but I'll make it clear to you very very very soon so let's come back to our PDF cheat sheet uh or rather PDF notes not cheat sheet let me close or I'll simply keep this cheat sheet open as well I'll close other tabs and let's talk about variables constants and keywords so for now just forget about how all this works and let's focus on the concept of variables constants and keywords what are these three things and why do we need these three things so let's talk about a variable it's a container which stores a value so if you have a kitchen and you cook some food in your kitchen there is a high chance that you'll have some containers which will contain some rice maybe some Dal maybe some um what do you call it um some tea leaves maybe you'll have some vinegar in some container you'll have some water in some container you'll definitely have some soya sauce or tomato sauce all those things in a container in a very similar way just like a container is used to store a particular thing we use small container for Dal and for rice and we use a big container to store say floor or we use bottles to store vinegar and also we use uh one or two liter bottles to store water okay so different containers for different things in a very similar way C programming language has a concept of container and container is nothing but a variable it is called variable in C programming language in fact in any programming language it is called a variable and it simply stores a value so in kitchen we have container storing rice T sugar Etc similar to that variables and C stores value of a constant for example a is equal to 3 now a contains a constant which is three B is equal to 4.7 B is aign 4.7 7 C is equal to a c is assigned a character which is a we'll talk about what characters are what floating Point numbers are and what integers are but for now we need to get a hang of how these things are working so let's talk about few rules for naming variables in C can I name my variable as 001 harry2 no I cannot do that and we'll see why we cannot do that so first character must be an alphabet or an underscore so you can use an alphabet or an underscore so let's try so I'll say intore a and semicolon and I'll say seven now just forget about what this int is what this equal to is how these things are working just focus on the concept of variable see I'm not getting any error I'm not seeing any error from my vs code when I type underscore a but the moment I say zore a and I save it you'll see that a red line is actually beneath this zero which which is basically telling me that hey you cannot name this variable starting with zero so I'm actually violating this particular rule because of which I'm seeing that error now commas and blanks are not allowed in variable names so even if I have it as underscore a and let me save it so even if I have an underscore a and I give a space and say Harry no this is not allowed the moment I save it this will give me an error but if I join it with an underscore and save it this is actually allowed because spaces are not allowed commas are also not allowed so if I put a comma and save it this is actually not allowed as well and this will also create problems a variable with this name will not be created okay so this is something that you need to know and let's move on to the next rule for naming variables in C no special symbol other than underscore is allowed so let me show this to you let me put a dollar here and save it no this is is not allowed the moment you try to compile this file you'll not get the desired output now no special symbol other than an underscore is allowed also variable names are case sensitive which means that if I have a variable called Harry and I have another variable which is capital H Harry these both are different variables and will uh store all these numbers differently in different separate containers these are not exactly the same thing so this is allowed so you can say in small Harry and in capital L and this will not create any problems in your program now we must create meaningful variable names in our programs this enhances readability of our programs and actually makes it easy for other programmers to read our code so this is something that you need to follow always use meaningful variable names if you want to create a variable for storing say value of a URL simply call it URL or value of URL do not call it ABCD or something else or your neighbors or your crush's name not do that just type the thing that it is for example if I want to create a variable for storing the amount of coffee that I'm taking per day I should actually name it amount of coffee cups of coffee or something like that I should not call it Puja Reena Tina or Monica for that matter so let's talk about constants for now an entity whose value doesn't change is called as a constant what is a constant it doesn't change three it doesn't change four is four it will never change four will never ever become five or 10 for that matter so four is a constant three is a constant something which is not going to change is a constant but if I say a is equal to 3 I can always say a is equal to 4 and I can actually put four inside that container which was previously holding three so I can change this container to hold four now so this is a variable we can change its value its value is three at this point but later it can become four also it can become 14 some time in the future so you never know but a constant is not going to change four is not going to change four is going to be four in this lifetime and even when we have kids of our kids they will also call it four and it's going to carry the same value which is four so four fingers are going to be this now 40 years ago and even 2,000 years later it is going to be four so it's not going to change change ever so this entity is called constant variable is an entity whose value can be changed now doesn't mean that it will always change but it can be changed so a equal to 3 can be changed B is equal to 4.7 can always hold 5.8 in the future so it can change this is something that we need to hold in our mind before we start with this chapter before we start writing programs and see I want you to ensure that you have this code Runner extension if you don't have this extension simply type code Runner and simply install it you'll see an install button here just like I'm seeing for Chinese and for editor config you simply have to click on that install button and your code Runner will be installed this will give you this run button here so whenever you are in a c program you'll see this run button so make sure that you get this run Button as soon as possible it will help you execute and run your C programs comfortably now we'll move ahead and talk about the types of constant we have various types of constants primarily there are three types of constants we have an integer constant we have a real constant also we have a character constant so we are going to see how we can write these three types of constants in C also we are going to see few examples of us assigning these constants to a variable so what I'll do is I'll open vs code you can see that I already have this program written I'll do one simple thing I'll say 02 underscore I'll simply say constants do c and the moment I say constant. C and um let me also copy the boilerplate code I'll Simply Save this uh what I can do is I can say int Harry is equal to 7 also I can say car Harry 2 is equal to C notice that I am using single codes for a character you have to make sure that whenever you are assigning some variable to a character you need to use single codes now this might sound very very confusing to some beginners but let me tell you something as we move ahead in this course you are going to find all these things very simple and easy so please bear with me for sometimes and definitely you are going to grasp all these uh Concepts very very easily similarly we use a float keyword now these keywords might sound very very strange to you if you are a programming beginner or C beginner for that matter but let me simply show you how we can assign some uh values different types of constants to a variable so I wrote 5.23 I could have written 5.23 I just removed minus sign uh and similarly I can use minus 7 when I'm assigning an integer to to this Harry variable now let's come back to the notes and let's build some understanding around this and then what we'll do is we'll come back to vs code and write some sensible programs so primarily there are three types of constants we already saw that integer constant real constant and character constant so this is very very important these three types of constants are something that you really need to remember and let's now talk about keywords What are keywords so whenever we are writing a program there is some part of the program that we have written it's coming from our mind it's coming from our head and there is some part of the program which is not coming from our head it is something that has already been reserved by the C programming language Community somebody who built this programming language reserved these keywords or rather declared these keywords as reserved so these are reserved words whose meaning is already known to the compiler so meaning of all these keywords is already known to the compiler now there are 32 keywords available in C uh let's see what those 32 keywords are but before we see these 32 keywords let me tell you you don't have to remember these keywords a lot of people try to remember these keywords and and that doesn't sound good you don't have to do this please do not try to remember these keywords this is something that we should avoid you will eventually start remembering all these keywords when once you uh start writing some meaningful programs and once you start building few projects in C language these keywords or other some of these keywords will definitely sit in your head now Auto double instruct break long else I have joted all these uh keywords down just for your understanding because I wanted you guys to have a comprehensive list of all these keywords at your disposal so let's write a first C program uh we have already written a first C program but I want you to write this program as your first C program type each and everything do not use any shortcuts or copy paste simply type this out Simply type this hash include stdio.h now uh simply say in Main and simply type it out do not think about what hash include is what stdi .h is do not think about what int main is what uh print f is what return zero is just type it out and execute in in your um vs code or if you're using some other IDE or source code editor uh which I do not recommend if you are a beginner please follow along if you are a beginner but if you are an advanced user just trying to hone your C skills you can simply come to this tutorial and use the IDE or source code editor of your choice so so once you start typing this program out uh let me write the first program as well so I'll say 03 uncore first. C uh so I've typed this program out and also what I'll do is I'll simply copy this uh I I told you that you have to type but I'm copying I'm copying because I don't want to waste your time to be honest but I want you guys to type it out because when you type it out when you type something out you actually remember things uh but if you copy paste and you know start running or simply read from the nodes you might not remember it that well so let me see if it is the exact same program which I've written uh hello I'm learning C with Harry let me write it down hello I am learning see with Harry and um back sln is something that you might want to write but uh let's write return zero and let's run this program also I'll save this program so what I'll do is simply run this program and once I run this program you can see Hello I learning see with Harry has been printed on the screen now let's talk about what this structure means what is this basic structure of a c program how all this works together this is really very important so let's talk about this let's talk about the basic structure of a c program so all C programs have to follow a basic structure a c program starts with a main function you can see that we we have a main function and execute instructions present inside it so main is a function now you might think what what is this terminology about what is this funct",TRUE

started so as you can see that I'm inside this folder on my computer and this is nothing but the set of notes that I've created for you guys you can refer to these notes after you have completed your python learning and it is an amazing material for revision let me tell you so I'll be starting with the chapter zero which contains how you can install python what python is and more importantly what programming in journal is so let's open this PDF as you can see I have this PDF open uh let's discuss about what programming is and then we'll move on to python we'll install Python and we'll take things forward from there so what is programming just like we use Hindi or English to communicate with people so just like we have languages like English Hindi we have French we have German just like we have all these languages to interact with different kind of people we have Python programming language to interact with the computer we have C language to interact with the computer we have Java we have C++ we have JavaScript there are a lot of languages out there which can be used to interact with the computer now let us say I have this pen and you need this black pen urgently what will you say you will say hey harry give me this pen but let us say I want this computer to start recording my screen I cannot simply say hey computer start recording this screen this computer is not going to understand now there are some special programs which can be programmed that way I'm not talking about those I'm talking about the direct instruction if I say send an email to this person to this computer which is not even turned on this is not going to do that so in order to interact with this machine in order to communicate with the computer what I'll have to do is I'll have to write a computer program and I'll have to write this computer program in some sort of programming language so programming is a way to interact with the computer it's a way to instruct the computer to perform various tasks the tasks which computer can perform obviously now what is python python is a simple and easy to understand language and it is one of the most easy to learn one of the most loved and one of the most popular programming languages out there in the market so it is a very interesting language to learn Lear and this is an amazing time to Learn Python and the code written in Python feels as if we are simply reading simple English so it's pretty easy for people to catch up and grasp what python is so this sudo good nature of python makes it easy to learn and understandable by beginners now let's get started with python and let's install python on this computer in order to install python on this computer what I'm going to be doing is I'll simply write install python and I'll simply follow this link python.org downloads this is the official python website and I'll download the python interpreter from here now you can see that I am being welcomed with this python 3.9.4 which is a current version of python let me tell you this might not be the case for you you might see some other version of python the version of pythons keep changing every now and then there is a new version with minor updates and tweaks in the market so no no worries if this version doesn't match in fact there is a high probability that this version will not match when you start downloading python because you might see this video later in the future so let's click on this download python 3.9 and let's run this piece of software you can see that I'm being welcomed with this installed python 3.9.4 64bit now it kind of sensed my operating system and gave me the required file if you are on Mac OS or if you are on Linux you will be welcomed with some other button which will download some other kind of file to your system since I am on Windows this particular website has given me an option to download exe file using this button and I have executed that exe file as you can see after I executed that exe file I can see this popup and I can simply choose options from this popup one of the most important options that I'm going to be checking is ADD python 3.92 path you need to check this check box because I want my python to be available from all the folders inside my computer I'll tell you what it means but just check this option and click on customize installation yes we are going to go ahead with customize installation don't click install now just click customize installation click next and then click this browse button but before clicking this browse button I want you guys to create a folder called python inside your local disc C by default your python will not be installed inside your local DC but let me tell you if you install python inside a folder which is very easily accessible like local DC python you can easily use Python and its resources you can look into the folders you can look into how python works in the future so it's just a great way to install python simply go to this browse button and choose this folder so I'll click this PC local d c and Python and I'll click on okay and then click on install and this will ask me whether I want to install python on my machine or not I'll click yes and this will start installing python on my system I'll wait for a while and this is fairly quick it might take some time on your system just give it some time and setup was successful we have successfully installed python on our computer let's click close And let's see if python works from our Powershell so right click on Windows and click Windows Powershell and once you click on this you will be shown this Windows po shell I'll simply type python here and bang you can see 3.9.4 python is working on this machine now I'll tell you how this python works you can simply play around with python by typing 7 minus 4 which will give me the result which is three and simply say 54 + 7 which is 61 you'll see 61 you can perform basic mathematical calculations python will do it for you but this is not the kind of task we want python to do for us right so let's type exit and opening closing parenthesis to instruct this interpreter to exit now I'll close this window and I'll move ahead with the chapter zero so now we know what programming is we know what python is we have python installed in our system and we'll look into the features of python now it is very easy to understand programming language you'll get to know while we move forward with this course Very less development time is involved with the python applications thanks to the easy to understand syntax it's free and open source it's a high level language it's portable you can either use it on Windows you can tomorrow buy a Mac machine and you can simply use Python there or you can go and buy some Linux machine or you can buy some other OS of your choice and python will just work fine like the way it used to work in your previous machine and it is fun to work with you'll get to know about this one after you make some programs with me so we have already installed python I have simply mentioned that python can be easily installed from python. while you click on the download button python can be installed right after you complete the setup by executing the file on your platform this is fairly simple and straightforward I have demonstrated this for you and I've even mentioned just install it like a game so it's fairly easy and straightforward to install python along with python we want to install another piece of software which is called Visual Studio code and I'll tell you what it is it's simply a modified notepad now I called Visual Studio code a modified notepad just to make things simple Visual Studio code is a source code editor it'll make things easy for you while you writing code in Python now a very simple question you might ask can't I write the code in notepad itself the answer is yes you can you can definitely write python code in notepad itself but it's not a great choice it's not a good idea to use notepad because of the reason reasons I'll mention let's install this Visual Studio code simply open this code. visualstudio code.com and click on Windows since I'm on Windows I'll be clicking on Windows option and you can see that this is downloading let me execute this file and let me run it once I run it on my machine I'll accept the agreement I'll read this agreement and click on next and choose all these options if you haven't already just check whether these options are chosen by default or not if they're not go ahead and check them one by one and I'll tell you what these options will do they'll simply make your life easier in the future don't forget this step just check all these buttons and click next and then click install and this will install Visual Studio code on your computer now many people will ask me that I have already installed Visual Studio code and I haven't checked all those options what do I do you can rerun the same setup and check those options and you'll be just fine but don't forget to check those options we'll simply uncheck this launch Visual Studio code and click finish because I don't want to open Visual Studio code at this point now what is visual studio code what did we just install you might ask let me go to a folder let me go to this particular folder which is Introduction what I'm going to be doing is I will open this folder inside Visual Studio code what does it mean what does it mean to open a folder inside Visual Studio code let me right click here and I'll see this option which I was not seeing in the past which is open with code this is Visual Studio code just click this option and visual studio code will be open with this folder as the context what does it mean if I show you this folder you'll see that this folder contains this file which is chapter 0.pdf and if I show you my visual studio code you can see that chapter 0.pdf is here as well what does it mean it simply means that this folder has been opened inside Visual Studio code I have access to all the files inside this folder through Visual Studio code now let us create a file using visual studio code by clicking on this icon this is simply to create a new file this button is for creating a new folder and this is to refresh the Explorer so whatever is here will be reflected here if you click and most of the times this is auto updated but in case if you have a lot of files inside your folder you need to click this but we'll hardly use it let's create a new file and I'll call it test file.txt and you can see that I'm able to edit this file I can close my terminal or I can open my terminal by clicking on new terminal and this will open a new terminal with this folder as the context this is the same folder which is here I mean the same folder in which Visual Studio code is open just think about how cool is that you'll see this test file.txt if I edit this test file.txt and I type something let us say 1 2 3 4 and if I save you'll see all the changes being reflected here as well so this is truly amazing because whatever is being displayed here is being displayed here and I have a bird I view of all the files inside my folder from VSS code and I also have an integrated terminal inside vs code so if I were to fire any commands from here I can do that I can type Python and this will open the python interpreter I'll close this for now but I just wanted to tell you that you can have all the things that you need inside one single program at one single place you can close them minimize them whenever you want and this particular program is going to make a life a whole lot easier when it comes to coding python programs so we'll see how we'll write a lot of python programs in the coming chapters so this was a basic introduction of python I just wanted you guys to be comfortable with python I hope everybody was able to install python correctly I want to make sure that each and every one of you were able to install python visual stud Studio code and you are able to access my notes correctly so I'll be following these notes all the notes which I've written this was chapter zero we'll be moving to chapter one soon and let's move on to chapter one to discuss more on Python and let's start writing python programs let's move on to chapter one now so let me get started with chapter 1 by opening this PDF which I've created for you so this is the PDF file which I've created for you I am not sure why it's not opening let me reload mode let me open my Google Chrome yet again and yeah it works fine I don't know what what happened in the first go anyways so chapter one is modules comments and pip so let's write a very first Python program and let's create a python file and let's see how python works but much before that what I'm going to be doing is I'll open this particular folder which is 1. chapter 1 in vs code remember we opened this chapter in vs code now we are going to be doing the same thing for chapter 1 so let's right click here and click this open with code option this will open this folder in vs code and I'll see all the files which are present in this particular folder here so I can create a new file here and it will be reflected here we have already seen that we have no doubts about that let's create a file called hello.py and py is an extension that we use for python files now the moment I made a file named hello.py my VSS code is telling me no python interpreter is selected you need to select a python interpreter so you can click either here or either here select python interpreter so let me click here and you can see that I'm getting this option python 3.9.4 so automatically my computer my VSS code has sensed that I have this python.exe installed on my computer so I'll click this and it will select Python 3.9.4 and now this knows that I have python 3.9.4 installed on my machine let me click on this extensions icon and I'll tell you what are the extensions that I'm using so extensions in vs code perform more than what it already does what I mean by that is we can have a python extension and we'll get a lot of convenience options and we can have live server we can have different sort of extensions which does different things we are going to be installing code Runner which is an extension and let me install code Runner code Runner is an extension which helps helps in running a code I have already installed this code Runner and the moment I install this extension I'll see a button right here as you can see I can use this button to run my code let me close this so another option I'm being welcomed with is uh Pence extension my vs code wants me to install pyland extension so let me install this and this basically gives me a lot of features you can have a look at this GIF and you'll see what kind of features you'll get with pyland and gc. collect so you can see that GC was a module and it automatically showed the available options that a person can use with GC we will see what this means and how this is going to help us for now I'll just click install and pance extension is now installed uh it's saying reload this window to activate so I clicked yes and it reloaded my window and my pyin is installed so at this point you should have code Runner installed you should have pyland installed so let me do one thing let me write print and the moment I write print or even PR it shows me print so this is what pance basically does it kind of predicts what I'm going to type so the moment I type PR it predicted that I'm going to type print and if I press enter you can see that print has been written here so if I write hello word in double Cotes you might be thinking why have I used these double Cotes here here bear with me just type whatever I'm writing and you'll be able to follow in the future so for now you just have to type this as is without thinking much about it just type print hello word save this file by clicking contr s on your keyboard and click this button so the moment you click this button you'll have an option to run the code click on run code and you can see that this prints hello word now I'm going to make a change here what I'm going to be doing is I'll click on this gear I'll click on settings and I'll click I'll simply type code Runner and I'll see all these options do you want to clear previous output when you are running a file yes I do want to clear my previous output because if I running a program I want to see the fresh output of that particular program I don't want to see the previous output along with the output of my current program so I'll check this and also what I'll be doing is I want to run my P file in terminal so let me check this one as well code Runner run in terminal so now instead of showing me output window it's going to show me terminal so that I can type further commands if I want to in that terminal so let me tell you what it does let me save it and let me run the code for you and if I run this file you can see that it is directly running in terminal you can also run in terminal by clicking this one run python file in terminal but I you know I I simply run the code in terminal anyway so I changed my setting to run the code in terminal so now if I click run code it will simply run this particular file for me in Python and hello word has been displayed congratulations this was your first program in Python if it was your first ever program right congratulations in the comment it's a great moment for you I hope you are enjoying programming and this is something which is bare minimum in programming whenever you are starting out with the programming language this is the first thing that we do we write hello word programs and you have sucess sucessfully done that in Python let me get back to the PDF that I've created for you let's write a very first Python program create a file called hello.py and P the below code in it we did exactly the same thing we wrote print hello word and let me tell you what print is print is a function in Python we'll read more about functions later but for now let me tell you print something will print that particular something on the output window as you can see that we simply type print hello word and hello word was printed as is in the output window and we are using these double quotes because we want to print hello word as it is we don't want to reference a variable which we'll talk about in this course so let me get back to this PDF and let me talk about how to execute this file so you can execute this file by using Code Runner extension you can also execute a python file by typing python space name of the file so I'll type Python and I'll type the name of the file this can also help me execute the Python program so you don't exactly have to use this extension but it simply makes your job easy you can simply click on this icon and click run code and this will make your job easy and you'll be able to run these kind of code Snippets so any file I want to run I can simply open that file and do this or I can type py t o n Python and then hello. py so I simply pressed h on my keyboard and pressed Tab Key on my keyboard and it autoc completed this to hello.py which made my life a whole lot easier because if I have my program names which are quite longer it'll be convenient for me to use tab so if my program name was let us say chapter 1 practice set.pdf dopy let's assume it was that way so if I type Python and I press C so you can see that it autoc completed it for me so when you type something and you press tab it tries to guess what you want to type so it tries to match all the characters which you have written with this and will try to guess whether you are typing chapter one or you are typing hello or you want to type play so this is Windows feature specifically terminals feature let me get back to the PDF that I've created for you and let's now uh move to modules what modules are so module in a python is a file containing code written by somebody else so this is usually a file which is not written by you you might be an author of the module uh that's why I've written this usually here but in most of the cases if you are beginner and you're using a module you're basically importing somebody else's code which has been written by that person and you can use that code without actually having to know how that code works let me give you an example you are using a phone to make a call to your friends now you don't have to know how that phone exactly works but you are making the call you are able to make the phone call to that friend so since you are making a phone call to that without having to know it you are kind of using that module as a blackbox you are using this phone as a blackbox in a very similar fashion we can import modules in Python which which can help us in doing different kind of work and we can simply use those modules import those modules into a program and we can use those kind of programs so let me show you an example of a module so if I want to show you the example of a module what I'll do is I'll create a python file called mod. py and I will import time so time is a module which can help me to wait for a few second before doing something so time has a function which is sleep and I can specify the number of seconds I want to wait for while this line is executing Let Me Wait for 2 seconds and let me print hello word or let me print 2 seconds have passed since this program ran okay so this is something which I'm printing by the way let me tell you that you can minimize the Explorer if you're running out of space and you have a small monitor you can simply do that and you can also close different files and open different files that's your choice I prefer to just open the file which I'm working with and if I'm working with a framework I simply open the files which I am specifically working with okay so in this program what I'm doing is I'm importing a module named time so time is a module which has a function called sleep I can use that function to wait for 2 seconds and then perform a task so if you want to wait for some time and then perform a task you can use this module let me click here and let me run this code as you can see the program has not end it immediately it has not printed this particular line immediately rather what it has done is it waited for 2 seconds and then it printed this particular line for me let me show it to you once again it is waiting for 2 seconds before it printed 2 seconds have passed since the program Ran So basically this kind of program can be written using modules and there are different kind of modules this was a very simple example of a built-in module I didn't have to do anything to install this module this was already available out of the box and let me talk more about module now so yeah this was all about module you can use somebody else's code and it makes your life a lot easier now let's talk about pip let's talk about what tip is now let us say I authored a module and you want to install that module so if you want to install a module which is authored by me what you can do is you can use pip to install that module so let me give you an example so pip is a package manager for Python and you can use pip to install a module like flask which can help you to build amazing websites or apis now you don't have to know what flask is but this is just an example of a module pip is a package manager which will manage all all sorts of packages like flask or Jango there are tons of other packages as well flask and Jango is one example we can use pip to install a module on your system and it will simply install it and now you'll be able to use it there are two types of modules in Python one is built-in module and the other one is external modules now built-in modules are the modules which are available out of the box you don't have to do anything to get them to your computer you just have to import them as we did here as you can see I imported this time module did I do anything special to get this module to this computer no I simply installed Python and I went ahead with using this module can I do the same thing with flask can I say import flask we know flask is a module we know flask is a module but the moment I say import flask and I try to run this program you can see that I'm getting this error no module named flask so basically my flask module has not been installed on this computer I need to get that module and I can get that module using pip so I can use pip install flask and this will install flask on my computer as you can see so it is getting all the files which it needs and finally it successfully installed all these packages which were required for flask to function properly and now if I click on this run button and click on run code this will execute this particular program without any hassles it will not throw any module not found error as it was throwing in the past so this way what I can do is I can simply install a module get that module and I can import that module to my program and I can make it work so super simple isn't it so let me comment this out and having said that let me also tell you about what comments are so what I basically did here was I pressed control+ for slash on my computer and that commented this line out what it means is simply I can press control for slash on my computer and I can either comment or uncommon a line what is commanding a line means sometimes I want to write something in my program which I don't want to execute for example I want to write waiting for 2 seconds so I basically want to tell user or the programmer which is looking at the code of this program and I'm waiting for 2 seconds here let me wait for 2 seconds here so I'm doing this thing here but if I save this and I try to run this particular code I'm getting syntax error and it is right syntax error is expected here because waiting for 2 seconds is not a syntax this is not valid python code but I want to keep this line here to instruct fellow programmers or developers that I doing this to wait for 2 seconds and I can write something meaningful here like why I'm waiting for 2 seconds what the purpose of this particular line is but I just want to write this so there is a way to write it there is is a way to tell your python interor that I want to keep this line here but ignore this and do not treat this as a source code so if I do this and if I save you can see that I'll be able to run this code successfully so 2 seconds have passed and the program ran so I'm not getting any syntax error which means if I want my python interpreter to ignore something I can use these pound symbols and write something and that will be treated as a comment which means my python interpreter will ignore that particular line or set of lines okay so let me get back to my PDF which I've created for you so some examples of buil-in modu os ABC Etc some examples of external modules are tensor flow flask Etc you can use these external modules sometimes you need to learn specific Concepts before you know diving into these modules for example you need to learn machine learning if you want to get into tens of you need to know what machine learning exactly is why you want to learn machine learning and all those kind of stuff then only you'll be able to use the functions and classes available in tensor flow now we'll get to object-oriented programming in the later chapters but this was the introduction of modules I hope you got what built-in modules are and what external modules are so moving forward let's discuss what rapple is now we have something called RL in Python and it's nothing fancy just the name of RL IS F believe me what we are going to be doing is we'll right click on a start button and open Terminal of Powershell if you are on Linux or you are on Mac feel free to open Powershell or terminal or git bash or whatever terminal you use on your operating system I'm using Powershell so I'll simply type python if you have installed python the right way just like I did you'll see this kind of prompt this prompt is called rapple now what does rapple stands for and what reppel is it's called read evaluate print Loop so what it basically does is you are writing some sort of statements we actually saw one way of executing python programs which is writing Python scripts we create a file we give it py extension and we simply put code inside of that now I'm importing time importing flask all of these lines are executed one at a time one by one from top to the bottom but in case of Rebel what we are doing is we'll keep on typing here and it will keep on getting executed as we press enter for example if I say print and I say hello word and if I do something like this it'll print hello word for me so it's basically executing it it read this statement it executed it it printed it it printed the output whatever the statement returned and finally it once again is ready to accept my input so it's kind of a loop loop it's a loop I'm I'm writing something I'm getting something and once again it's ready to take inputs so it's basically a kind of loop as you can see that I have mentioned about rapple here we can use python as a calculator by typing python enter on the terminal this is my terminal I'm using power shell as my terminal I can use this python as a calculator now once again I again want to emphasize on the fact that we don't want to use Python just as a calculator I know you have calculator in your phone or maybe you might have that scientific calculator that we used to buy at College I hope you have one if you have attended College anyways so basically 3 + 5 is 8 and 7 + 8 is 15 and we can perform multiplication operations we can perform different sort of operations we'll read about operators more and more as we proceed but you can see that it works just like basic mathematic works okay so we can use python as a calculator like this I just wanted to mention about RL so this is r PL and it's not like you'll never use RPL you'll write scripts for complex program,TRUE

django app better better in the sense of deployment we can deploy it anytime any way we want with the same set of python packages that we were using before so we documented all the packages inside this requirements.txt file and we'll be adding the packages that we use in this django app inside this file if i fire python py run server you'll see that i have this uh development server created and i can very easily navigate okay so what i'll do is i'll simply add a slasher and then i'll say admin and i think i've already created an account yes the username was harry and the password was harry and and it's totally fine we had some blocks in there we had some contact objects in there and i think it was pretty good and we are ready to deploy it because we are very nicely in shape to add content here we can paste in images we can do a lot of stuff with this okay so there are few things that i want to change though do you remember we added tiny mce to our blog by using blog.js let's say i want to copy an image and i'm going to paste it to tinymce so for that we have a setting in tiny mce i don't know what it is but i'll search it for you tiny mce uh paste image i think it's something like paste image true or something you just have to add one additional entry and you have to tell tinymce that i'm going to paste some uh images inside this and please take care of that ah yeah paste data images let me copy this and let me add it to my tinymce configuration so here's my vs code i'll add it and then i'll add a comma let me save it and i'll show you what it does so if i come back to my django administration and let's say i want to structure this jquery tutorial for beginners really well so what i'll do is i'll simply come here and i'll copy an image let me see if i can copy an image from somewhere let us say jquery let me call it jquery and let me open image let me copy image and let me see if i can paste it so once i press ctrl v i can paste data images in this and it'll be great for me to you know save it and see the same image as a base64 so this is added as a base64 image if you don't know where base64 images i think that's totally fine all you care about at this point is to see this jquery tutorial image here but i haven't added it inside jquery tutorial it seems or there is some issues if i save it jake okay so i have two jquery tutorials for beginners let me call it jquery tutorial for beginners to let me come back to blog let me click on next and yes we have this image here so we can add a lot of images we can also add uh add the code so if i add code like this i'll press enter and i don't have all the features here so let me come back to tinymce documentation and they have a page wherein they show all the features i'll come to example and yes this is the one fully featured so there are two types of fully featured one is including premiere plugins we don't want to deal with this one what we are interested in is fully featured non-premium plugins now i'm not discouraging you not to buy this but i think free is just fine to get started so once i add this javascript to my tiny mce configuration i'll i'll see this uh all these options in my django admin for this blog okay so what i'll do is i'll come to js and i'll select all these things from starting to the very end i'll copy them and i'll add to my tiny mce so i'll remove this and i'll not add selector and i'll also not add uh another thing paste data images let me see if they have paste data images set to something else they might have it set to false and i need to ensure this paste data images okay so they don't have it so i need it let me save it and i'll tell you something that i learned through experience that if you are facing any difficulty in getting this update all you have to do is press control plus shift plus r control plus shift plus r will hard reload and it will bring in all the fresh files from your static directory okay but for me the normal reload worked well or you can also restart the server and you can clear the browser cache and you will see but that is a difficult way a shortcut is to press ctrl shift and r and once you do that i think it works really great okay so you can see this semicolon here if i click this semicolon and if i say i want to add some code and let's say i want to add python code and let me add this views dot py let me copy this views.py and let me paste it here and once i save you can see it's so beautifully aligned here i can simply click on save and let me see if it is reflected here yes it is reflected here now there is a library called prism.js let me show you you can add it if you want but for now i'm going to skip it because i want to see my blog and deployed as soon as possible okay so you can see this prism js library it is really very beautiful this is how your um your code will look like if you have prism enabled on your blog so i like uh where is my monokai theme i think it's called okay idea this is this is monokain sublime it's they call it okay i don't know whether i'm pronouncing it correct or not but i think this really looks cool and clean to me so i use this and you can simply scroll down and use cdn or you can simply download however you want to use it okay let me skip this for now because i don't want to make it difficult for you to deploy this vlog let us deploy this blog as is let us assume that this looks perfectly fine okay and this actually looks fine if you want to just publish some posts and once you have 30 40 posts on your blogs you can simply change the formatting and you can make it look good there are a lot of things that we can do we can add some social media icons we can make it better in ipad mobile phones and all those things but i think it's fine bootstrap has already done that for us but i'm just trying to tell you that you can customize your blog later for now we'll focus on deployment so let's get to the point of deploying the site all we want to do is to deploy this site now you must be thinking why are you telling me how to deploy this site can't we just drop in the files into the server and simply run python manage dot py run server in the background and it should work just fine yes you are right it will work just fine but there are some issues with that but before that let me tell you what kind of hosting is available for django now if you if you're serious with your blog and you really want to see this app deployed in production and you expect say 20 30 000 of visitors visiting your blog and reading your blog and you cannot expect any downtime or any kind of issues with your site you need a dedicated vps now there are some more complicated deployment methods like kubernetes docker i don't want you to get into all this if you are starting new uh if you are starting with django and you are not a devops engineer it's really straightforward for you to use a vps now what is a vps if you don't know what a vps is vps stands for virtual private server virtual private server means a computer a machine which is there in the cloud somebody has already purchased that machine for you and they can provide access of this machine to you if you pay them dollars oh yes nothing is free okay so once i type vps one two three four these four people want to like party they're saying please take vps from me this guy's saying please take it from me these guys think please please take it from me why because virtual private server is something that makes them a lot of money but we don't want to dive deep into how they are making money all we want is a good vps you can go with hostgator you can go with lynnode you can go with anything i'm telling you every provider which obviously you know is not a scammer is good okay you need to make sure that you are not dealing with scammers if somebody is listed on page one in google they are definitely not scammers and these companies are pretty famous right linord hostinger and we can rely on these what i personally use is if you want to ask me what i personally prefer and what i have been using since years is digit lotion so digital ocean offers a lot of products it offers a lot of product it's not just about vms one of their products is vm i use this because i like it you might not be interested in this but it's just a matter of company it's just a company which is dealing with that if you want to follow this tutorial as is you can buy delete lotion i'll drop my referral link in the description what that will do is that will help you get hundred dollar free indeed lotion so if you get hundred dollars to start with i think that is amazing you can deploy your website i think for a few months six eight months for free all it cost is five dollars per month because we are just getting started we don't have 100 000 visitors visiting our website okay so how to get started so in order to make this process easy for you what i've done is i've already logged into my ddlotion account this is my daily lotion account i have a lot of production droplets and i have a lot of a servers but once you click on my referral link in the description and you create an account you will be redirected to an account creation page and i think you need to add a payment method you will not get charged you'll only have to add a payment method and once you add the payment method they'll give you hundred dollars and for hundred dollars you can deploy your application for say uh for a lot of time and you can check the terms and conditions i'm not sure but yes you get something for free and it is amazing yes it is amazing so let us do something here let us get started with a droplet so what i'll do is i'll simply click here create and then i'll choose droplets what is the droplet droplet is a fancy name for vm and this is a name given by digilotion they call their vms as droplets now this is not a concept but droplet is something exactly it's exactly same as virtual machine it's not even similar it's it's the virtual machine okay so i'm choosing ubuntu 18 because it's pretty good and another reason for choosing ubuntu 18 and i should say another personal reason of choosing ubuntu 18 is they have very nice guides written all over the internet and i really like the guide so digitalocean has a lot of stuff on the internet then they are asking me to choose a plan uh keep it standard now here you need to choose five dollar a month because we don't expect a lot of traffic to our website so five dollar a month you'll do just fine believe me now what i'll do is i'll select a server here you can select the nearest server to you i'll select bangalore because i live in india and it's nearest server to me but you need to make sure that the server is as nearer to your visitors as possible it will not matter much but it's it's a good choice it makes sense to choose a server which is physically near to your visitors okay choosing a server in amsterdam or new york will not harm me significantly but you got the point okay you can choose whatever you want but i prefer to choose whatever is nearer to me now here it will ask you to create a password you can create any password of your choice what i'll do is i'll create a password code with harry123 and after creating a password what i'll do is i'll create this password i think this password looks good okay so i'll choose this password or maybe i'll choose some different password because last time i created a vm some nasty people hacked into the vm and not even hacked into the vm they use the password from the video and they did some nasty stuff and i don't want to discuss that here but i need to choose a different password what i'll do is i'll choose a different password which i'll not show you and what i'll do is i'll keep some host name then i'll click create droplet and my droplet will be created and i'll be back all you have to do is fill in a password choose a host name or you can keep it as default but you can choose a new host name with your name or something else and then what you have to do is click on create droplet and this will create a droplet i will create my droplet and get back all right guys so i just set up this virtual machine i named it as code with harry test and this is the ip address and what i'll do now is i'll show you how to deploy your django application to this server now how do we log into the server you can use terminal of your choice if you have ubuntu already i am on windows as you can see if you have ubuntu or you are on mac os it will be straightforward for you to use terminal and ssh even if you are on windows powershell it will be very easy for you you can simply go to windows powershell and all you have to do is you have to copy this ip and after copying this ip address all you have to do is you have to say ssh and then you can say root add the rate and then your ip address you can use ctrl v to paste and then it will ask you to um whether you want to verify this fingerprint or not you just say yes and all you have to do now is i'll just enter the password and bingo i'm inside the droplet so this is how it looks like and now we are inside that virtual machine which is provided to us by digitalocean okay so i hope everyone is here so far if you are not here make sure this is free you can go to the description you can you know take the link take the referral link and you will get hundred dollars for free and you can deploy play around and once your referral bonus is over you can actually pay and deploy your websites because nobody is going to give you deploying for free and with unlimited bandwidth because how would they earn if you if they give it to you for free there are some free hosting services to be honest but they are not scalable nobody will give you compute for free okay make sure that now we are inside this ubuntu droplet all i want to do is i want to ensure that i have everything that is needed to deploy a django application so what i typically do is i go to google and i say how to deploy a django app in ubuntu vps and guess what digitalocean pops up okay and i'll also write ubuntu 18 because this is the operating system that i'm using and i look for the relation guide now i use apache server but we can use any server we want we can use nginx as well but i like apache server it's really great and it's easy to use so what i'll do is i'll click here and you can see it's showing me ubuntu 16 guide which will work just fine but i want to find some updated guide from digitalocean ubuntu 18.04 i hope they have a guide on one to 18.04 deployment and even if they don't have it we will move forward with this because the windows 16 works just fine okay and i'll guide you with everything so since we are using python 3 uh first we need to do uh apt update so apt update will pull in all the updated packages and it just updates all the index and once this app update has been finished what i'll do is i'll run this command so let me copy this and let me paste this and once it runs i'll tell you what it does so why and then you have to you'll have to press enter it's asking you do you want to continue or not you'll have to say yes i want to continue let me tell you what this is this is a mod of apache so this is something that you need along with apache so this is mod wsgi that we are adding to the apache server and we need this just because we need to install our django application to apache but before this we also need apache installed into our server so for that what i do is um i go to internet and i say digital ocean plus lampstack setup now what is lamp stack you must be thinking now lam stack stands for linux apache mysql and php linux you know linux is an operating system apache is a server mysql is a database and php is something we need for phpmyadmin now you must be thinking what is phpmyadmin but let us install it okay so i'll click on this resolution guide and it is for 1 to 18 which is a good news for us but even if it is for ubuntu 16 we can i look into the commands that it is issuing and they work just fine and if we run into any problems i am there for you we we will fix them okay so apt update and then they are installing apache too so ideally before this you can fire this because apache 2 is a server and we are installing this mod on top of apache 2 but since i've already installed this mod not an issue what i'll do is i'll paste or i'll type simply apt install apache 2 y enter okay so it's saying that apt install apache 2 the following package was automatically installed and is no longer required okay so here's the thing so apache 2 is already the newest version so if you install this apache mod it will automatically install apache for you which is a good news that's fine okay now what we want to do is we want to allow the incoming traffic so what we do is we fire this command to see the list of available applications and a simple right click will paste it into the terminal and now what i'll do is i'll simply allow incoming traffic to this apache full profile if you want to see what is inside this profile you can fire this command but we are finding this command just to see what is there in this profile copy paste and we show uh okay so i think i pasted something something wrong i should be copying this and i should be pasting this like this okay so it's telling me that apache v2 is the next generation of the omni present apache web server okay sounds good i want to allow the incoming traffic so if i copy this and if i paste it to the terminal it's saying rule updated so we can now see incoming traffic to apache 2. so let us verify this let us go to this ip oh yes it works so we can see this apache to ubuntu default page which is a good news for us okay so now what i'll do is i'll simply go back to that guide which was showing me how to install lamp i want to finish up installing lamp stack oh yes we saw this page which means the install works now what it is telling me is install my sequel now we don't have to install mysql because we are not using this uh my sequel thing but we'll come back and install my sequel latest so this is not a proper lamp stack installation to be honest what i'll do is i'll come down i'll not even install php because i don't even need php so let us not worry about these things we'll come back in some other video and do it at this point my only focus is to somehow deploy this application in as less amount of time as possible okay let me copy this one pip3 install virtual env you know what virtually nv is now right so pip3 install virtual env it installs virtual environment yes it did now what i'll do is i will come back to a new tab why i want to install filezilla ftp so all you have to do is you have to say filezilla ftp and you'll have to download this piece of software now what is the software for this software is for uploading files to the server now if you are using it already you can do git pull but if you want to manually transfer files to your server you need an ftp client so what you can do is click download filezilla client and it will download it for you now i can click this download filezilla client and then wait for it to download i think it's downloading okay so you can click here do not buy anything and do not buy anything accidentally most importantly i'll click this close and will open this piece of software and install it and come back i already have filezilla installed so i don't have to do any further steps let me wait for it to finish so it has finished downloading and now it's opening you can allow it and run the installer and it it will install this piece of software so i'll cancel because i already have this installed i'll open my filezilla ftp and after opening my filezilla by clicking on start you'll see that i have this thing over here okay what i need to do now is copy this uh ip address and paste it here and then the username is root and i'll type my password okay and then import you have to say 22 because this is the sftp port click on quick connect click on ok and this is the place where you will see your server now go to slash var slash www slash django okay or let us call it mountain because if you remember this was the name of our website so let me open this directory first slashware slash www so i'll go to this directory now what i'll do is i'll right click i'll say click directory and enter it i'll say mountain and this will create a directory called mountain the next step is to drag in all the files here so that i can upload my blog to this mountain folder let me go back to my folder this is my mountain coders folder i'll control a i'll remove this dot gate i don't want to upload dot get i don't want to upload dot vs code i also don't want to upload this my project tnv all i am worried about is blog mountain encoders this db dot sqlite let me add this db.sqlite3 as well so i'll copy these files to this server and let us wait for them to get uploaded and as you can see that they are being uploaded now if i come back to my powershell and i do cd slash var slash www slash mountain by the way you can press tab key to auto complete slash where slash www slash mountain okay so what i'll do now is i'll fire ls to see whether i have all the files that place or not let us do one thing we just installed virtual environment let us try to create my project env as a virtual environment so we have this virtual environment so what i'll do now is i'll say source my project env bin and activate this is the command so if you are on ubuntu this is the command to activate the virtual environment let me press enter and this virtual environment has been activated now what i'll do is i'll say paper install minus r requirements.txt how did i type this requirement so fast i just said r e and i press tab to autocomplete now tab key can be used to autocomplete a file which is already present in the directory so i can press enter and as you can see it's installing django it's installing pandas for no reason because i just added that pandas i don't know why did i add pandas but let it be added we are just learning django at this point do not add any additional packages they'll just be an extra overhead on your server you don't want that okay let me say python manage dot p by run server and it is saying that it works it works very nice but can i go to port 8000 and see my blog let us try that let us go back to port 8000 and i want to tell you it will not work and i'll also tell you why will it not work but let us go to the server and port 8000 it doesn't work why does it not work because we are serving a local host and this local host for a remote server is that remote server i want people to come to this particular server and access this django application okay so for that all you need to do is you need to give a command to python manage dot p by run server and what it will do is it will instead of creating a server at 127.0.0.1 it will create a server at http or rather let me call it 0.0.0.0 which means you want to connect to the server it is serving the files from the ip address which means anyone can come in and connect to the server let me press enter let me start this server and let me see whether it works let's reload so it's saying that disallowed host at invalid http host so we need to add it to allowed host i'll tell you what it means but for now what i'll do is i'll simply stop it another thing you want to do is if it doesn't work you'll have to say ufw allow 8000 because sometimes 8000 port is not allowed to your server so incoming traffic will not be able to reach your server so you need to say your w allow 8 000. currently the firewall is not active so if i do ufw enable i i can activate the firewall but i don't want to activate the firewall but in production you should be activating the firewall it is important to activate the firewall otherwise people will do um nasty things and will try to hack into your system but for the sake of this tutorial let us not enable firewall okay to keep things simple now it is saying disallowed host at http underscore host header this you may need to add this to a loud host okay so we'll follow we'll say ls we'll go to cd mountain coders will say ls will edit this settings dot py file you might as well edit an upload but what i am doing is i am directly editing this file from here after you open vim you need to press i key and i key will allow you to type inside this so i'll make this single quotes i'll copy this thing the server ip i'll copy and i'll paste i need to press ctrl v why does it not work i think i forgot to copy okay so right click is for paste i don't know what's wrong but i'll type it manually 206.189.142.61 and this is a python list by the way yes it is fine let me see if python manage dot p white and server works so cd dot dot slash for going back one directory and python manage dot py run server oh yes it works but i want to run my server like this 0.0.0.0 i hope i got it right 0.0 i think i need to make it like this and yes it should work um let's wait yes it works let me reload oh yes we can see your mountain coders blog um into production yes it works and yes it looks amazing now it's saying that there is no table called blog i think it's telling me this because i have not copied my tv dot second three i don't know why it's not copied why was it failed it was failed for some reason could not start the transfer let me reset and re-cue all right click process queue let me try to upload it again all transfers could not be finished i don't know why it's not able to upload i think i'm already using this file so this file is not readable for some reason i don't know why reset and req all process queue override so i want to upload it so yes it is uploaded now so you need to stop your development server now i think if i restart this server i should be able to see my blogs oh yes i can i can see all the blogs so it works pretty fine and it looks good wow it works it definitely works but let me tell you something let me tell you something i don't want you to deploy this application like this there are many reasons for that first of all um django's development server is not a very powerful web server so you need to use apache server now how do we use apache server let me tell you how to use it um also if your process goes down for some reason due to some error or due to os killing the process which is hosting this which is holding this application in your operating system it will be really very problematic for you so let me tell you uh how to install it how to deploy it sorry so we need to deploy it in an optimal manner let's go back to this blog where these people are telling how to serve django applications using apache okay now you can go back and read why we need apache there are n number of reasons one of those being that apache is very available and highly reliable and a powerful web server which can scale with your users and it will provide a very good experience to you your application will be highly available and you will know why we need it by spending some time in hosting your apps in production so what we'll do now is we need to add the static url and static route so let me do one thing let me stop right here and i want you to grasp the concepts that i taught in this video and once you have grasped all the concepts then i think it will be ideal for you to come back and see how to deploy the same application using apache if you want to run this in background you can simply say ampersand at the end and no hub at the starting so no hub python manage dot v run server and this thing just press enter and your blog will be deployed and i can even close this and it's still there it's still there so if you want you can take this ip address you can access it and what i'll do is i'll come back in the next video and i'll show you how to point a domain to this ip as well as how to leverage apache server for this blog okay so we'll come back in the next video and we'll see how to deploy django application using apache server this method will work just fine but not if you have a lot of users and if you need no downtime yeah if you want to have some down times yes you can go back uh your operating system might kill this process this python process this is simply a hanging python process inside your operating system and you don't want to deploy it like this you want uh apache server to take charge of your application of your web application and apache server should be able to serve the application and should take the responsibility of the uptime of your application so we'll come back and see how we add apache web server how we add apache web server and virtual environment to our vps we'll see all those things we'll do it in practical so do not worry but before that if you haven't already accessed this playlist please make sure you access this playlist because this is the place

really amazing to see that we were able to create a blog of this quality in such a short span of time and it really looks good but now is the time to move towards deployment of this blog now why is deployment important when you are creating a blog with Django or some other website it is because this is how you get on boarded this is how your business gets on board if you are creating an e-commerce website or even a blog for that matter it is really important for you to get the deployment right otherwise your users will see severe downtime which might affect you indirectly or directly so let's see how we can move towards the deployment we have already seen how we structure this how we create the blog how we add the post now is the time to deploy this blog so let's get started so what I'll do is I'll click on blog and I just want to fix few things before we move towards the deployment and those things are I just want to add some minimum height I think I've already done that in contact page so let's see how we have done that so I just want to add the style to all the pages I want to have this container to have a minimum height of 90 viewport height so VH is a unit which stands for viewport height so let's add the same thing to our blog post page as well so I think we need to add it inside a blog CSS I like to call it more CSS so that it is very clear where I'm adding the CSS might even call your blog with whatever name you want so I am calling my block as CSS I'm calling this blog as block active so that's your choice okay so I think this will fix this hide issues let me reload this and yes it indeed fixes this height issue most of the time the content of a blog is going to get past this 100 VH limit so will not see any issues if we deploy it as is without adding this style but I think if we add this style it's better for us ok enough of talks I can see this none - here I think I have added some print statements which is not a good practice by the way so let me come back to views and let me see if I can get rid of these print statements here so I've printed this previous and next I should get rid of them I don't want to see any nasty statements here I don't want to see anything strange in my logs later okay so I think I have fixed that it has not yet no lead okay it has loaded now so let me reload this and let me see if it's gone yes it is so let us create a virtual environment now what is a virtual environment virtual environment is an isolated environment for your app so let us say you were deploying your Jango app in a VM inside that VM you might do something else with Python 3.8 let us say and let us say this Jango block is deployed using Python 3.5 now Python 3.5 doesn't support have strings and Python 3.8 supports have strings let us say you want to use F strings in some other project and you install Python 3.8 for that now what will happen if you upgrade your Python 23.8 this app will stop working why now let us assume there is a feature which is present in Python 3.5 but it is not present in Python 3 point unit has been deprecated you will face some issues so how do you isolate all the Python packages and create a new environment a separate environment just for this Jango app it is achieved using virtual environment so let us see you how much your environment works if you haven't accessed my Python playlist I think you should do that if you don't know what your environment and you want to learn by them I have I have talked about virtual environments if I'm not wrong I have talked about virtual environment in some of these videos you'd have to find it it's watch it from the starting this is a Python course you should definitely be accessing and let us now come back to our terminal though I am using git bash ok and I use git bash on windows because it gives me look and feel of Windows terminal I'm sorry Linux terminal so if you're already on Linux then you will definitely be seeing some other terminal you will see the Staller but if you're using Windows PowerShell there is this minor change that I'll be telling you but let us start installing virtual env so you can say pip install virtual environment I think it's virtually and V if I'm not wrong I think it's virtual env yes it is virtually env so it's already there for me but it will install for you if it's not there for you now you can say virtual env and I like to call my virtual environments as my project env then call it whatever you want you can call it Hari you can call it a Sam you can call it a Rohan you can call it whatever you want I'm calling it my project env for no good reason I'm just calling it I'm just choosing a random name and calling it as my project env as soon as you fire this command what happens is a project gets created here my project env and this is your Python environment which is isolated from your C global Python interpreter or some other virtual environment from some other project what I mean by this is my project env is a Python interpreter which I have spawned off my systems interpreter and now I'm going to use this my project env as a virtual environment this is a separate environment for this app even if I install Jango from my say base Python interpreter which is on my local disk C and Python 3.8 even if I uninstalled tryingo from there it is not going to affect me in any way because I am using a virtual environment which is isolated so let us see how to activate this virtual environment because I am still using my system interpreter so I need to tell my terminal hey terminal I want to use this my project env I no longer want to use my global Python interpreter switch settings such that whenever I say pip install you should install to this my project env so for that you say source my project env scripts and activate this will activate your virtual environment now I am using git bash okay make sure you have good bash if you are firing this command but if you are on PowerShell then you should be using a command like this my project env and then scripts and then activate dot ps1 this is the command for activating a virtual environment inside your windows powershell so if you're not using powershell and you are using git bash you can follow me but but if you are using windows powershell this is the command okay this is the command for windows powershell make sure and you then note that there is no source here okay let me press control C now I already have my my project env environment activated how do I know this I know this because I see this my project env written inside the parentheses here okay alright so far so good let us now start firing clip install Chango because we don't have django installed inside this my project env my django has started installing but at the same time what i'll do is i'll create a new file called the requirements dot txt what is requirements dot txt and why did I create this I created this requirements dot txt so that I can know what all these packages inside this requirements dot txt and in the future if at all I want to replicate this environment if I want to create this virtual environment once again I know which packages were installed inside this virtual environment and I can refer to this requirements dot txt there is a command as well which will install all the packages from a given requirements dot txt we talked about that let it install so it is installed Chango so I'll simply say Django but at the same time I'll also note down the version of Django that I installed so I'll say double equals two and then I'll go down the version of Django which is three point zero point eight so I'm saying install Django version number three point zero point eight is there anything else that I need to install let me peek into my views dot py I don't think I have use any other package so if you're using any external package like pandas numpy let us assume we are using pandas I'm not using it but let us assume we are using it and simply say pip install pandas so it is installing pandas let it install pandas will give it this time and once pandas is installed you will note down the version of pandas that it is installed so come on come on come on I don't know why it's so slow it used to install very fast previously I don't know why it's getting slow I think my machine is getting slower day by day I need to upgrade maybe ok so let me find out the version of pandas so it's 1 point 0.5 I'll simply say double equals 2 and I'll paste the version number okay now we have these two packages inside inside our virtual environment now if you want to get out of your virtual environment you can use this deactivate command and this will take you out of your virtual environment now why did I make this requirement start exe you must be thinking why did we note these packages we noted this packages so that we can recreate this my project env are you getting it let us say I delete this and I'm pressing delete you must be thinking hey don't do that but no on deleting it I deleted it ok as you saw I deleted my project E and V so if I try to activate this it will not activate it'll say there is no directly called my project env so what I'll do is I'll recreate this my project yeah me now you don't have to do it you don't have to delete it I deleted it just to show you how we can quickly recreate the environment with the same packages using the acquirements dot txt so we have this my project env back now what I'll do is I'll say pip install - R - R means installed from this file take all the packages which are there inside this file and simply install them one by one so if I press ENTER you collect all these packages from requirements dot txt file and you'll start installing it in wherever environment you are if you are inside your virtual environment start installing these packages in your virtual environment if you are in your system interpreter it will install all these packages inside your system interpreter so it depends upon where you are so it is installing these packages for me I hope I activated my virtual environment I didn't activate my virtual environments my bad I should have activated my virtual environment so this is a mistake I made by the way I fired this command without activating the virtual environment so it's actually installing all these packages in Mike Lowell system interpreter but that's why I let it do it let it do it what I'll do is I'll simply go to my command history and I'll activate this virtual environment now if I install pip install - our requirements dot txt once I fire this command now all these packages will be installed in this environment previously I didn't had this environment activated so it installed all the packages from requirements dot txt on my system interpreter okay so let us wait for these packages to install and once these packages are installed we have on my project env ready and once we activate all my project env we can start using our django app we can start firing python managed or py run server it will definitely create a server for us and we will look into all these things so I'm just waiting for this to finish come on come on come on and what I'll do is I already have this my project env activated I will simply fire Python manage dot py or run server and it will start a development server at 8000 ok now it is about to be finished I think I should pause the video and come back once it is finished I don't know why but it really took some time for it to complete I think my PC has gotten very slow if you have some good hardware configuration maybe you'll be able to install it very fast at least faster than me now what I do is I have this project my project env activated what I'll do is I'll save Python manage dot py run server and it'll start the development server so let me click on this and let me click on blog contact home blog contact it works as expected I just want to make a change I want to change this color - BTN primary so I want to come back to my templates based on HTML and this one replaces the success with primary control is to save and let me reload this and yes it looks fine I think I should not make it outline I should make it darker version of this so instead of BD an outline primary these are all bootstrap classes by the way we have talked a lot about bootstrap so I think it should not be a problem for you at this point I'll come back to blog and now the color of a blog is kind of blueish so it looks fine having it looks way better than before and I think it is ready for deployment now let us go back to our terminal and see how we are going to deploy this okay so the very first step that you should be taking before deploying is pushing your blog to get now git is something that makes a lot of developers uncomfortable but people who really know how to use git they really love kit and I personally really love kid I don't know how I would have managed had there been no gate so create a file called dot git ignore if you don't know what it is no need to worry seriously it's super simple I'll show you how simple it is so you just have to say dot git ignore and I'll put in the name of the folders that I want to ignore my project env is something I want to ignore I don't want to use this my project env inside my repository because I know that I can create this huge folder anytime using this requirements dot txt file so I don't want to push it at the same time I don't want to push this DV dot sequel i3 because it's going to grow with time and I don't want to push it I want to use first of all I'll be using another database that I'll show you very soon but once again I just want to put this TB dot sequel id3 [Applause] ctrl s to save I don't want to push this TV dots equal I'd three to my gate is there anything else that I wanna ignore yes I wanna ignore this dot vs code because this is a folder created by Visual Studio code and why would I push this as a part of this project definitely not I'm not going to push this to github okay I'll see and once I save this what I'll do is I'll simply initialize this project so I'll say get in it now you don't have to use gate but I just want to initialize this as a git repository and push it to get if you are getting uncomfortable I just want to stop and not use git because you might get uncomfortable and thing why would I teach get inside a Chango project but believe me it is super simple so let us just initialize the repository and I will explain you what it will do so once you say get in it it will initialize this repository as a git repository and you are just saying that this folder is now a git repository can you see this my project E and V and DV dot C collide three greyed out this simply means that these two folders are inside git ignore and get is not tracking them okay once you change any file they'll be tracked by git so you can keep changing the files and all the changes will be tracked and you can roll back and it's really an awesome tool will come up get in some other video someday but at this point just fire two commands blindly get ad dot will add all the files to staging area and git commit minus M initial commit this will create a commit and why I'm using gate here I'm using it just to track my project with time I'll be changing my files a lot and I want them to be tracked by git this is because I don't want to see anything wrong happening while I'm coding and deploying things okay so this is something that I want to do and I think this is it for now I will come back in the next video and show you how to deploy this Django blog inside a VM I hope you got the concept of virtual environment and it is really super simple to use a virtual environment in my opinion if you haven't already accessed my Django playlist I think you should definitely access it because this is a place where I've added all the videos and this is a place where I have step-by-step explained you all the things we have created project in increasing level of difficulty so I hope you will enjoy if you access this playlist so if you haven't already like this video I want you guys to like this video please and thank you so much guys for watching this video and I will see you

i'll do is i'll come back to my website and what i'll do is i'll design this contact page we'll create a model and we'll add the ui components and then finally we'll attach this model to the ui components and then we'll see how the information that is being entered by the user in the ui can be captured by the model and be saved in the database so let's see how all this is going to work what i'll do is i'll close all the tabs and once again if you haven't already access this playlist please do it right away because this is going to be the place where i'm adding all the django videos so you should access it as soon as possible you can click here to bookmark it and you can click here to save it one more thing that i want to tell you is that i'll do things little quickly here but i'll explain you whatever i'm doing i have been doing this thing since a very long time in this course we have added a model and we created a form in our i think it was to do's list app if i'm not wrong and then we have done the same thing inside our django blog as well so let me come back to this page and let me open my templates and here is my contact template and what i'll do is i'll go to getbootstrap.com now bootstrap 5 has arrived but again i'm using bootstrap 4 because it is in the stable version at this point so let's use bootstrap 4. it's not a problem you can change the version here but it's fine you can use whatever you want you can even move to custom html css javascript with that said i'll move to forms and let me quickly grab a form which looks good i think this should be fine to start with ctrl v to paste and let me see how this looks so email address and password i don't want to capture email address and password i just want to capture a name so let me capture email of the user i'll say email email id will be email but id is not the thing which is captured by the form any backend uses the name attribute to identify the input elements so i'll say name is equal to email instead of id is equal to email you might as well keep the id but name is going to be the attribute which will be used by the backend so our model or rather i should say django view will see this thing uh this name and identify which element and which data is coming towards it okay so let me close all other tabs close tabs to the right i don't want to keep the useless steps i should not call them useless but for now it is useless because i'm working on contact.html so uh what i'll do is i'll come back here and let me see if i can grab something else from getbootstrap.com email address i think this form looks better but but it's fine i'll uh copy the components let me copy this component let me put it inside this and if you switch to html instead of django html you'll be able to format it so let me format it and instead of email address i'll say tell me your name and type is equal to text so input type is equal to text is a type is an input type and type is equal to email is an input type and then we have a password and we also have a phone and if i'm not wrong so type is equal to phone you can simply search it on the internet input type is equal to phone uh so we do have an input type is equal to we have a type is equal to tell not phone i'm sorry so you don't have to memorize all these things as you can see i don't memorize all these things but yeah you should have an idea that something of this sort exists okay so placeholder is equal to i'll keep enter your name [Applause] i'll put this here and then what i'll do is i'll say name here and then at the same time i'll say name is equal to name so name is the attribute that i have to set here i'm setting this name to email here i'm sending this to name and i'm saying enter your name and i'm saying enter your email then i'll say um i'm not asking for password but what i'll do is i'll ask user for their phone number maybe or maybe i'll say that write something about the service did you like the service or not or something of that sort okay so let me grab a text area from getbootstrap.com let me copy this let me paste it in ctrl s let me see how it looks it looks fine let me add some margin at the top so let me add some margin at the top let me say my 4 and i think that should be fine this is fine but again i want to add a heading as well so i'll say h2 contact us reload okay contact us and you can add some padding here as well i'll say uh p y three let's see how it looks so i'm saying class is equal to plus is equal to py3 and let me reload i think this looks fine i might as well reduce the margin from here i'm not designing a perfect website you can uh see how your users are perceiving the website you can take people's opinion and you can ask people how your website is looking but for now i think it's fine name email address maybe i'll take phone number as well i'll say tell us about our service how was our service or how may we help you okay now what i'll do is i'll copy this once again and maybe i'll ask for users phone number i'll say type is equal to tell and i'll say phone number phone phone name is equal to phone now i'll not be using the id attribute you must be thinking why i'm setting the id attribute when i'm not using it but i'm setting it because it's already set if you come to getbootstrap.com you'll see that the id is said i'm just setting it to something but you can remove it if you want but i think that's fine in the future if you want to target any element then id is going to be the thing which we'll use so let me save this now and let me come back to my form and see how it looks it looks cool except that i should have phone here instead of name so what i'll do is i'll say enter your phone number control s to save and i'll say d e s c d e s c d e s e means description also name is equal to d e s a okay i think it looks cool now okay so this looks pretty good let me make p n n small because it is a placeholder and uh lowercase looks fine okay so this is my contact us page and i'll make it capital you must be thinking why am i uh focusing on these small things but i kind of have a habit of doing this okay anyways uh we'll now reload this page and this looks fine now i'll come back to my models.py file and inside the models.py file i'll make another model i'll say contact and model start model and what i'll do is i'll say serial number is equal to models dot auto field and i'll say primary key is equal to true because i want to make it the primary key i'll say primary key is equal to true then i'll say title is equal to or not title i think we have email we have a name we have an email we have a phone and we have a desc and we have to decide how we want to uh design the database table what field is going to be a character wheel what field is going to be the date time field what field is going to be the text field so description is going to be the text field for sure so model start text field okay so you must be thinking how to decide whether we need a text field or a care field if i tell you if you are creating a website that is not going to be consumed by a lot of users i would say that it's fine you can use whatever you want but there is something called best practices if your description is going to be say 300 to 400 characters long and even longer than that in some cases you might want to use text field okay and for phone number we have a phone field but uh in django three i think they have introduced something for phone they have introduced something for slug as well but i like to use scat field because this keeps our basics very strong and i think it is the best thing so what i'll do is i'll make the max length of phone as 12 so that somebody can enter 12 characters if they want to and let me make email as 40 characters let me make name as 40 characters i think somebody with the name of 40 characters need to have a nickname and they can put their nickname so i'll save this and probably i'll have this time field as well i'll say auto ad now is equal to true this will tell me when somebody contacted me otherwise i'll keep wondering when this person contacted me was it three days ago or it was it 10 years ago was it 20 years ago anyways so i'll stop my server and i'll say python manage dot py make migrations python manage dot py migrate so make migrations well make the migration files and then migrate will actually write those tables inside the database okay once i finish this i'll start my server back and i should be able to see okay so there are some problems looks like no there is no problem i'll go back to admin and for sure you'll not see the contact here because i haven't yet registered the model so i should be going to admin dot py and i should register the model which is it is called contact so i'll say contact and i will save it i think okay so i i'll have to register it separately admin dot site dot register and what i'll do is i'll say contact contact please okay yeah so here it is i think our server has been restarted and we can see the contact here so we have zero contacts here now what i want to do is whenever somebody fills in the form uh will make a post request to this contact endpoint so what i'll do is i'll open my urls.py so whenever somebody comes to slash contact or for blog they are presented with this page okay so this is the view which is going to get executed whenever somebody comes to my blog and fills in the form so whenever he fills in the form what i'll do is i'll capture his name so i'll say request dot post okay so if request dot method equals to equals to post you must be thinking what i'm doing here you must be thinking what's going on here but i'll explain you each and everything when the request dot method is post what i want to say is i want to say if somebody is hitting this end point with a post request that is if somebody is making a post request to this end point then do this otherwise you just have to return render contact.html so i'll keep this name inside if so if requested matter is post i'll capture this name so i'll say name and then i think we have if i'm not wrong we have uh phone we have email then we have phone and the esc so email phone descr email phone dec okay i hope this makes sense i think we are making some mistake while indenting this okay this should be fine and once we have all these variables what i'll do is i'll store all of these in the database so i'll create an instance i'll say instance is equal to contact and i'll say name is equal to name email is equal to email and then i'll say phone is equal to phone and then i'll say desc is equal to desc and i'll have to import contact control s to save and then i'll have to say instance dot save and this will save it to the database once again i'll come back to my contact.html and i'll say action is equal to slash contact contact and method is equal to post method is equal to post and i think this should be fine and let's see if this works i'm not sure whether this will work or not but let me change this to name and i think everything is fine now and let me change this to phone this is for phone this label is for this phone and this label is for this tesc i think we are good so let's see if this works and if it doesn't work we'll see the error and i will fix it okay so email at gmail.com let me input some random phone number and i'll say i want to help [Applause] and i think i'm misspelling help no problems so it's saying that there is some error we are sorry so let me see what the problem is they're saying that you call this url via post but the ul doesn't end in slash and you have a principle i said can't redirect to the slash url while maintaining post data okay so it's basically telling me that whenever you have to make the post request you need to have this trailing slash so let's keep the training slash i'll ob whatever django is saying and let me reload this continue and is it telling me the same thing i think i need to restart the server once again and let me reload the page and let me fill the form once again and i'm just putting some random things random thoughts submit and it says csrf verification failed okay so i told you about csrf if i'm not wrong i told you about csrf in today's list let me tell you about csrf once again so csrf stands for cross site request forgery and cross site request forgery happens whenever you are trying to hit somebody else's website who doesn't want you to hate his website so in order to make sure that the request is coming from the same website the website supplies a csrf token so if i switch back to django html not django text and html note that this is being given to us by the extension that we have installed django html so this is the extension that we have installed if you have watched the videos you know what i mean so what i'll do is inside the form i'll say csrf token and if i keep this csrf token inside the form what happens it django engine automatically generates an input tag which has the csrf token and that csrf2 can actually verifies whether this request is coming from the same domain or not let's see if this works or not so if i go back and fill the form once again i don't know how many times i'll fill it once again but i think this will work this should work now please submit and it works let's see if we have the data saved in the database or not oh yes we do we do have the data saved inside the database so we have successfully created this contact page and it works it does work okay so let's come back to blog it looks good and i think this looks amazing but i won't like to change the number of posts on this blog page to 10 at least because it doesn't look good to me so i'll come back to views dot p y and i'll change this number of posts to say 10 or say i'll make it seven so if i reload the page next page should have only one blog post and it looks fine it's fine i think we are good we are definitely good and the previous page works as well i can read any blog i have not written it beautifully but i can write it beautifully when i go to production i'll definitely make sure that i write it beautifully now as you can see that this blog post doesn't have the main height set but whenever we are writing a blog post i think it will at least have content enough to cover this page so i should not worry about this but i might want to consider adding min height to this page you can do that if you want i'm not doing it but mountain code's blog looks amazing now i want you guys to tell me in the comment section below how does mountain coders look to you is it looking amazing i want you guys to give it some marks from 100 out of 100 how many marks would you like to give to mount encoders please reply in the comment section please reply to this question i want you guys to tell me how many marks would you like to give out of 100 to mountain coders mountain goddess looks pretty good at this point but we haven't created search i would like to have a search inside my blog because when i'll have say 2000 articles in my dreams or maybe i'll make it a reality someday to 5000 articles then users on the website would like to have a search button they would come back and search for a given article and they might recall something about my article type in some keywords from the article and they would want to see the article where back again when they typed the search terms say they type python they would like to see the python python articles on the search page but at this point we don't have anything such but we would love to have one so what we'll do is we'll come back and we'll design this search and it will be awesome for our users to have a search inside the blog they can enter any term and they can get the results corresponding to their search terms that would be amazing so we'll see how to design that but at this point i think this blog is ready for production you can take it to production you can start flaunting your coding skills to your friends to your girlfriends or whomsoever you want you can tell them that you know how to create a blog and you have a blog which is hosted online well i'll tell you how to host this online as well but at this point i hope you guys understood whatever i told you all the concepts how models work how migrations work how views work how mvd pattern works and i hope you guys have access this playlist if you haven't already done that i want you guys to access this playlist

static in order to quickly load our website I hope you guys are enjoying this video in this video what we'll do is we'll design peach Nation for the blog now pagination is really an important topic and if you have a lot of pages you'll definitely know the worth of pagination so what I'll do is I'll close all these tabs and just open this playlist and I'll close all the other tabs let me go to Django admin let me show you the structure of the blog page after adding a couple of more blogs so I'll say this is another one first post to let me add few more I'll just add some gibberish here so please don't mind I'm just adding something which doesn't even make any sense but please excuse me for that because I don't want to add something sensible okay so it's saying that please correct the error below there is some error what is the error I don't even know what the error is okay so it's gone now so I'll say jQuery something something something some numbers say I think that should be enough so I've added a few gibberish blocks so 0 of 8 selected let me see how many blocks are added so there are a lot of blocks are added and let us see I want to see only 5 of these ok 1 2 3 4 5 and I want to see you rest of them on the next page okay so I should be able to configure the number of blocks I want to see on this blog homepage how do we do that you must be thinking how to design pagination do we need any library for that do we need to do we need to borrow logic from somewhere I think we can design pagination really very easy so let's try this out and let's add two buttons first of all so what I'll do is I'll come back to my blog home and I'll add two buttons so after the for loop what I'll do is I'll add two buttons so I'll say button dot BT and odd BTN primary now the from the bootstrap frame well you can go to get bootstrap cotton grab your button but since I remember the classes I'm adding them as is so I'll say previous and then I will say next I'll save it let me reload it so previous next I want this next to flow to the right so what I'll do is I can add this to the right so what I'll do is I'll add a div dot row so there are a lot of ways to get this done you can choose any one I'll simply go to bootstrap documentation components or rather I'll dude bootstrap and then I'll say float right let me see if I find something okay so float right is a class in bootstrap I can add float right class to this one and I think this will work float right doesn't work here it doesn't work here because Rho is a Flags box I'll have to remove this class is equal to Rho and rather I'll put my three now if you don't know web development HTML CSS basics let me know if you want me to design a web development series for you guys if you want me to design the series I'm ready to make videos but you'll have to share the channel you'll have to support me and definitely I'll bring a lot of three courses for you so we have this previous button we have this next button so let me go to Internet and I'll say previous HTML code ampersand I think it samples and prev let me see if I can find something previous button next button okay so it's called an e qu o and are aq old P see how it works so l eq u o and are a qo let me see what this gives me reload okay I think this looks good I'll add a space here I will just add a space and this should look fine and I'm not designing it very well I think it should be enough this should be fine so what I've warned is I want to show only repose on one page and I'm going to through rest of the posts on the next page onwards okay so what I'll do is whenever somebody clicks on next I'll pass question mark page is equal to two okay so I'll see a question mark page is equal to two and whenever page is two I've want Gengo to start the pose from say if there are three posts then I want you to start from the fourth post onwards and display three posts from there how to achieve that how to achieve this pagination will have to write the logic so whenever somebody is coming to this blog post page or rather the blog page because this is the blog homepage I'll say number of posts is equal to say 3 now what I'll do is I'll say if a request dot get and let me print request what get page number let me reprint this thing so I'll print this thing so these are the things start you'll not remember over the period of time so you'll have to print and see how this looks so let me see how this low self print request would get and I'll see the console what it prints so whenever I reload this page request would get prints - nari where page is equal to - I think that's fine but what if the page is not equal to - does it print a blank - honey let me find out yes it does and if I try to query it with page number does it throw an error or does it tell me that it doesn't exist or is it none okay so it is none so what I'll do is I'll say if the page number is not set that is if the page number is none I'll say if page is none and what is page page is this thing pH is equal to request dot getparameter what you do is else you set the page to increase your version of page okay so if the page is none you'll set the piece to 1 if the piece is not none you'll set the page to integer version of the page so if I print page here I should get 1 2 3 4 something like that okay so if it is nothing I'll find this one being printed on the console because it's none but if I say question mark page is equal to 3 it will show me the number 3 here it's showing me one I don't know why let me see okay so page number not page I'll say page number rather what I'll do is I'll make in this one page so let me reload this 3 is being printed so the logic works fine so far so I have very cleverly scraped the page from the URL I have this page inside the page URL now how do I fetch the 3 blogs from this page so what I'll do is if the page number is 0 let me let me create the table for you so that you can understand this ok so if the page number is not 0 the page number is 1 what do I want I want the blog posts from 0 to 0 to 3 if the page number is 2 what do I want let me make it : I want the blog from 4 - I want the blog from 4 to 4 5 6 I want to block from 4 to 6 and then when the page number is 3 when I want I want the blog from from piece number 7 to 9 okay I hope you're getting the logic I'm just thinking out loud I just want to think out loud and let you know how I'm thinking so what I'm doing is I'm saying when the page number is 1 I'll fetch the blog post from 0 to 3 when the page number is 2 I'll fetch the blog from 4 to 6 and when the page number is 3 I'll I'll I'll get the blog's from number 7 to number 9 and I'll send it to the HTML page but how do I make it dynamic how do I link it with this page variable so what I'll do is I'll say 0 x Paige and I'll make this one three x or rather I'll say - not - this is a - I'm sorry so 0 x Paige - from 0 x Paige - - Paige okay so if the page number is 3 I'll say from 0 to 3 show all the blog posts now then once again what I'll do is I'll say when the page number is 2 this will be from 0 to 2 which will be a problem so what I'll have to do is I'll have to design it such that this schema fits ok so I'll have to design the formula which fits the schema so I'll have to design a formula which gives me 0 2 3 when the page value is 1 and it gives me 4 - saying so when the value of pages - and it gives me 7 to 9 when the value of page is 3 what is that formula let's find out if I make page x so this thing is a peach x or rather page - 1 x its page - 1 x c2 I think I'm making a mistake here 0 to 3 then 4 5 6 0 it should be 4 to 7 and because 7 minus 4 is 3 3 minus 0 is 3 and 9 minus 7 okay let me make it 8 because see we are adding 3 here so it plus 3 is 11 so I think this is the right combination I'll have to design it this way so what I'll do is I'll say this is page - 1 x - let me see if this fits in so when the page is 1 this works when the page is - this works when the page is 3 when the pages - it doesn't work okay so let us look at it this way I made a mistake here I should write 0 - 3 then 4 to 7 then 8 to 11 how will the first place look like first page will look like 0 to 0 + number of pages okay number of I should say number of posts yeah it's called number of posts let me copy it so it's number of posts so from to zero plus number of posts then when I'm going to the next page what I'll do is I'll see from number of posts to from number of posts to number of posts plus number of posts so from number of pores to number of pores plus number of posts okay then once again from number of posts plus number of posts to number of posts plus number of posts plus number of posts okay so this is how it's going to look like so if I design it in a pythonic manner so zero to three then index three - I'll have to make it three to say three four five zero three then I'll have to add three once again so 3 to 6 and then 6 to 9 okay so 6 7 8 so we are fetching 3 posts at once so this is how it will look in a pythonic way okay so if you are going with numeric way then you'll write 0 to 3 then from 4 to something I'm just trying to think out loud there and I don't want to make the logic and keep it and show you the logic I just want to design the logic in front of you so that you can also learn how to design logic like these so if I think in a pythonic manner the index from 0 to 3 will be shown when the page number is 1 the index from 3 to 6 will be shown when the page number is 2 and when you are slicing a Python list you should know that when you say from 0 to 3 the 3 is excluded and 0 is included when you say 3 2 6 6 is excluded and 3 is included and when you say 6 - 9 9 is excluded in 6 is included so we'll use the Python less slicing okay so this is how I'll write it in a pythonic fee and for page number one this is going to be the condition for page number 2 this is going to be the condition and for page number 3 this is going to be the condition ok so from this much - this much so if I were to design it in terms of the number of posts so I'll make it 2 from a number of posts - number of post multiplied by 2 then multiplied by 3 so here it's multiplied by the number of pages or the piece number okay so what I'll do is I'll write this formula as a page number minus one page number minus 1 this is P number minus 1 because here it's 2 here it's here is 1 2 minus 1 is 1 here it's 2 3 minus 1 is 2 so it's page number minus 1 here and then to page number minus 1 plus 1 that is page number multiplied by number of posts so this is how page nation will work ok so what I'll do is I'll simply slice my list from page number minus 1 to page number x number of posts so if you put page number 1 here it will become from 0 to number of posts if you write 2 here then this will become from 1 okay so I made a mistake once again I should multiply this with number of posts number of posts because this is 1 into number of posts this is 2 into number of posts that is page number minus 1 multiplied by number of posts so this is little bit I should not call it complex because it's pretty straightforward but you might have to spend some time I created this logic on the fly in front of you so it took me some time I don't remember the logic that I create I might have created this logic in the past but once again I created it in front of you so I hope you like the logic and let us see the logic works or not you liking the logic is not as important as chang-ho liking the logic if Django likes the logic this will work and if Chang who doesn't like logic it'll not fall so django should like the logic first okay so let us see if it works so let me see if it is rendering the blocks in this fashion or not so let me reload it saying page number is not defined what is that okay so I should call it page and not page number peach this is page let me see okay reload 1 2 3 4 5 ok so it has disappointed me yet again blocks has equal blocks dot object dot all and when I'm slicing it I think it's it's giving me all the posts so I said number of post is equal to three why is it rendering all the posts there is some problem here so let me reload this once again okay so I'm saying piece number three which is why it's showing me all the posts let me call page number is equal to 1 or 2 1 2 3 4 5 okay I think it works it works number of posts series the number of post is 3 why is it showing me 5 posts it is some problem where when the number of post is 3 and the page number is 2 let us see what formula returns number of posts 3 and page number 2 when number of posts is 3 and page number is 2 okay so I didn't multiply this here my bad I should have written this here as well I know most of you guys must have noticed this while I'm typing but I make these silly mistakes please excuse me for these let me reload and yes it works 1 2 3 and let me see page number is equal to 3 yes it works it works and when page number is 4 nothing is shown so what we'll do now is we'll do one thing we'll add these page numbers to the buttons as well so what I'll do is I'll pass this page to the context okay so I will add the speech to the context or rather what I'll do is I'll add previous and next to the context ok so previous and next and let me call it NXT because next is already a function in Python so let us not mess with that so previous page will be pH minus 1 and next will be page plus 1 but it's not that easy because you know what when your page number is 1 you don't want to return 0 so what you'll do is you will say previous is equal to page minus 1 you'll say if previous is greater than 1 it is greater than 1 then you will say previous is equal to pH minus one else previous will be none there will be no previous same goes with the next if what I'll do is I'll say if next is or rather I should call it page not previous if page is greater than one then previous will be page minus one here what I'll do is I'll say if page is a less than if page is less than some number we'll find that number if page is less than that number then next is equal to next plus one or page plus one I'm sorry if next is equal to h plus one so what is that number when we have say three posts on one page what is that number let's find out so when we have I let me open this blog I think I made a mistake here so let me call it zero so that this loads okay I'll have to add a colon as well let me reload this so it's saying that next has been referenced before the assignment okay so there is a problem and let me fix this when page is greater than one previous is equal to page minus one else previous is equal to none this makes total sense but if page is less than zero what I'll do is next is equal to PS plus one otherwise next is none okay but this will not be zero I'll tell you what it is else and XT is equal to none okay so how many maximum pages will you have how how will you calculate the last page I just want to make sure that this is not the last page page should not be the last page page should be less than the last page what will be the last page the last page will be number of posts that you want to display on one page or or rather what should I say I should say blocks dot objects dot all dot length the total number of blog posts so I'll have to do something like this and here I'll seal in length is equal to blocks length of blocks okay I'll say if page is less than length divided by number of posts now this will give me this will give me something point something if there are four pages that will give me three point something okay so what I'll do is I'll make it see I'll make it seal off length divided by number of posts and I'll have to import math here so math dot C okay so I'm using the C function so C function will make three point six seven it'll convert this to four five point six six will be converted to six let me show you let me show you here this is important to grasp otherwise you will not understand what I'm doing import math mad dot see if it is three point five five four is returned if it is seven point five eight is returned so it is basically returning me the number of pages that my that my blog should have okay number of pages that my dog should have so so the point I want to make here is that if I am showing the last page to my user I don't want my user to navigate to the next page so I'm saying that if page is less than Matt dot seal and let me comment this out because this is not a valid code if the page is less than Matt dot C length divided by number of posts then what I'll do is I'll say okay you are qualified to gather next page otherwise you are not qualified to get a next page and the next is going to be none okay cool so I think I've written this twice no problems ctrl s to save and then what I'll do is I'll come to my blog home dot HTML and what I'll do is I'll say if I'll use F from Jinja and say if previous if the previous is not none if pre means that if the previous is not none then what I'll do is I'll add a href is equal to anchor tag H ref is equal to and I will be adding the previous link here so I'll say previous and then what I'll do is I'll move this thing to to the end of this previous otherwise what I'll do is I'll say else otherwise this thing is going to be this hash so you're not going anywhere you'll remain on the same page there is no previous for you similarly what I'll do is I'll implement the same logic for my for my next let me copy this let me copy this thing control X control V and I'll have to add this float:right class as well because I want it to flow towards the right ctrl s to save and I'll have to add this next so let me copy this anchor tag ctrl V to paste ctrl s and if I reload this you can see that the previous and next is here but there is a problem that this previous is by default being shown as blue color so let me change the color I'll give it a glass of text it's light if I'm not wrong yes it is text light if I'm not wrong let me see if it is text light it should be text light yes it is text light so next is being shown correctly let me add this text light to previous as well so I'll use multi cursor functionality from V s code so what I'm doing is I'm pressing the alt and holding it and wherever I click I'll see a new cursor so I can pace whatever I want and then once again I can click somewhere else to get rid of these multiple cursors okay so I hope that this is making sense now let me reload this it is being shown in previous as well but there is a problem the next is not a valid link here so what I'll do is I'll make sure the logic is correct and at the same time the link should be let me see if I'm referring to the correct variable or not so next is equal to pH plus 1 if page is less than bad dot C length divided by number of posts so let me print length here and see what it prints because this is something that you'll have to test if you're making a logic like this you will have to test it again and again to make sure that it works so it is showing me the page number and the length length is 8 then 8 divided by number of post will be here divided by 3 which will be 2 point something the page will be less than 3 so I think it should show me next is equal to pH plus 1 so let me see what it shows me when I'm going to the next page but it is showing me hash so let me see what what is going wrong here what I'll do is I'll print and I'll panel remove all the print statements wherever I am saying print something I'll remove those statements I'll say print previous and next let me see what previous and next are so for the first page previous has to be hash next should not be hash so next should not be null next is 2 so I think I'm undoing something wrong here so I'm saying if previous said I should say for next year and I should say if NXT here I think it will be right now so let me reload this okay so when I'm reloading this am again not seeing the correct next year so I'll have to make sure that everything is right so I'm saying that if next which means that if next is not null what I'll have to do is I'll say this should be my ok so I'll have to add a char F is equal to I'll have to add the correct H F as well I have not added the corrected affair I'll explain the logic once again so don't worry about it I'll explain you the logic once again I will say / blog / pH is equal to or rather / blog question mark page is equal to this thing and we'll have to add the same thing here as well to make it a lead link reload it and I'll go to the next page peace is equal to - page is equal to 3 and this is the last page so I'm not seeing anything else here so it's hash here so I cannot go further anymore if I come back page number to page number one and then I cannot go any further back okay so I hope that this is making sense to you but how did I do this and how is this logic working let us understand once again because let me be honest here while I was designing the logic on the fly during the video I think it was not very clear what I was doing so let me now explain you what I was doing so we have the number of posts that we wanted okay so let us change the number of close to four let's see if it works so I'll go to blog one two three four let me go to the next page pages one at this point so I should see page number two then I should say no page number three because there are only eight posts inside the database okay previous/next I think we are good okay so let me explain how this thing is working so we have number of posts here and we have page number here number of post is is defined by the user so we can come back to this if you start py and we can change the number of posts to say three or five or six whatever we want to see we can even change it to ten if we want to see ten posts per page but at this point I have made it three so let me made it make it free now what I'll do is I'll find the page number and say do I have the page number in the URL is there any question mark Page is equal to something in the URL now there might be a page there might not be a page if there is a page what I'll do is I'll grab the number of the page but if there is no page which means that the page is none I'll set the page to one that means that the page is one okay otherwise if the page is given in the URL I will type cast it to integer because by default requested ket will return a string okay so you'll have to type casted to integer otherwise you will not be able to perform in teacher operations with this page variable so now the page isn't a teacher now what I'll do is I'll find out the slices for my blog dot object start all the is to grab all the blog posts from the database and then what I'll do is I'll find the number of the blog post that I want to display so the index of the blog post that I want to display on the first page is zero one and two index of the blog posts that I want to see in the next pages 3 4 & 5 because 0 1 2 were displayed on the first page so on the second page I'll see 3 4 & 5 similarly I'll see 6 & 7 on the last page okay so how do I design this let me come back to this logic so what I'm saying is I'm saying that from 0 to 2 should be the number of blog posts that I want to display on the first page 0 1 2 okay now in order to do slicing in Python we'll have to give the first number which has to be inclusive of the index okay so the thing is that when I'm saying blog is equal to blog dot objects start all 0 to 1 it will only give me the first element in the list if I'm saying 0 2 3 it will give me 0 1 & 2 this one is not inclusive this one is also not inclusive this is inclusive of the elements in the list okay so it will give me 0 1 & 2 this will give me 3 4 & 5 this will give me 6 7 & 8 but not 9 okay so these are the number or rather the index of the blog post that I want to pull from the database okay so what I'm doing now is I'm writing these numbers in terms of the pages and the number of post so what I'm doing is I'm saying for the first page I want to take 0 2 0 plus number of posts which is 3 for the second page what I'm doing is I'm taking number of posts - number of posts + number of posts because I want to show the number of posts this - this has to be the number of posts just think about it now after I wrote this I want to write a formula that can generalize this thing the formula that can journalize this thing is page number -1 x number of posts to page number x number of posts and if you subtract this if you do this minus this if you subtract this from this you'll get number of posts ok so you can do that if you want to try you can try that this minus this will be number of posts so you can take this minus this you will find that it is equal to number of posts so we are showing the number of posts number of posts in the page okay in a given page so if the number of posts is 3 we will show three posts on one page so what we are doing now is you're grabbing the length of all the blocks so it can be a tea it can be thousand it can be two thousand gave me ten thousand if you are owning a big blog but at the end of the day what you're doing is you're slicing the block okay you're slicing it and once you slice it it will pull the blog from the database whose index you have given to if you have one thousand blocks in your database and you're saying give me the block from six to nine it will pull six seven and eight for you so at the end of the day you'll have six seven and eight inside the blocks and you're passing it to your blog home dot HTML page and after you pass it to blog home got HTML page you can display it there but I get we need to design pagination as well we need to have some mechanism to get the next page and the previous page now it's pretty simple to get the next page you just add one and it's also very simple to get the previous page you can do page minus one but what if you are on the last page on the last page there should be no next page because if you try to go to the next page you will get some error and we do not want our end user to see any sort of error okay so what we are doing is we are saying that if the page number is greater than one then previous is equal to pH minus one otherwise previous has not paid minus one it is none similarly if pages are less than the last page this is representing the last page number if it is less than the last page number then the space plus one otherwise next is none which means that there is no next page I do not want to display any next page for the user because there is no next page I'll not be able to pull any blog post if I display that page so I don't want to display that page okay now coming back to blog home let me save this file coming back to blog home I am just checking if next is say none then what I am doing is if it is none I am displaying this thing and displaying its ref is equal to hash but if it is not none so you must know that if returns true when it is given a nonzero integer so this will return true whenever next is not none okay so whenever next is not none you will see this which means you will see the next page same goes with previous as well whenever you say if previous you will see the previous page if previous is not none but if previous is none it will go to when previous has done this condition will be false and it will go to else and you will see this okay and you will see that this is working the logic is working and this is the same logic which is used by all the plugins that you might use in beed simple page nation BJ query data tables you might have come across a lot of plugins you can use them there is no problem with that but we can design a very simple P generation logic using this and if you understand this well then I think you can code anything inside your China blog now this was little bit mathematical but I think it was worth it at the end now at the end what I'll do is I'll make these part in smaller in size because I don't want my previous and Next button to look smaller or equal to these buttons so let me come back to button and I'll find the smaller button I'm just looking for a button which looks little smaller than the normal button I think it's called BTN and Sam if I'm not wrong I don't know where it is so I will just simply search BTN SM bootstrap or buttons it's here if I search for SM so it's saying that you can use a small button by adding BTN SM let me add this PD NSM here is my bt and it's here so I'll add this to all the Reid wall and let me see if it works they load okay so this looks little smaller than normal and I think it's totally fine I might as well change this previous and next to green so if I want to do that what I'll do is instead of primary I'll call it success success save it denote it and they are turn to green now so you can design your websites however you want if it doesn't look good to you you can change it or maybe you can make this read more as outline it's totally on you you can design your website however you want to this was not looking good so let me change it - BTN BTN outline I think it's really an outline primary if I'm not wrong let me check I just want to search outlying here I'm looking for outline I'm not looking for BTN okay so BTN outline is the class so BTN outline primary so this is the class let me see how it looks mmm reload okay so this looks fine now I think this looks better another one and whenever I move my cursor to this read more it gets highlighted I think this is fine now I can go to the previous page once again I can go to the next page next page and it's loading really very fast if you use some WordPress or Joomla or some other CMS I think it would be really very slow due to the plugins given the same strength of the server same power CPU and RAM of the server you will find that your Django websites are way better than your WordPress or other CMS websites because you have the entire control Shengo is modern advanced and last but not the least it is PI tonic which is something that we are looking for at this point in 2020 we are looking for something which is pythonic in nature we want something which can give us that feeling of code that we want in this modern times okay so in the next video we'll come back and I hope that you are able to digest the logic that I created in this video but we'll come back in the next video and we'll design the contact page and we'll see how we can create another model and we can save the contact details of a given user and I hope you liked this video and you have access the playlist if you

a rich text editor experience more and more better now what i'll do is i'll save all these images that i like and let us keep it inside the slider so inside img i will save it okay so this is my portfolio website folder what i'll do is i'll go to mount encoders folder static and let me create a directory called img and inside img let me save this with the name slider1 okay that makes sense so let me save it now one dot slider1.jpg and let me reload and see if i get a better image than this one okay so this image looks good as well let's do save image as and i'll call it slider two slider two let me see if i get another better image i think this looks good as well so let me call it slider 3 and this is a matter of choice if you don't like this website if you don't like the image you can do the customizations as and when required so i have saved all my files inside img folder of my static directory now what i'll do is i'll come back to my index.html and instead of saying source.unsplash.com what i'll do is i'll go to slash static let me say static and i'll say slash img slider1.jpg and then once again i'll do the same with slider2.jpg slider 2.jpg and once again with slider3.jpg [Applause] slider3.jpg and this should load the images that are saved so i think this looks good but again i think i changed the images at wrong place so my bad i should have changed the images inside this so no problems i'll once again do the same thing for my about section the mini about section that i have on the home page so instead of calling it slider i'll call it uh let me call it icon1 it's actually not icon so let me call this let me call it thumbnail thumbnail one thumbnail two okay but before that what i'll do is i'll have to go to unsplash.com to grab these images so thumbnail 1 thumbnail 2 and thumbnail 3 uh thumbnail 3 so the image was 160 by 160 so what i'll do is i'll go to unsplash.com and instead of going to unsplash.com i'll go to souls.unsplash.com and what i'll do is i'll copy this one not this one i just want to have a url which will give me the images by searching with search term i'll copy this i'll paste it here and my image was 160 by 160 [Applause] and i'll write coding here let me write coding here i hope it pops up a nice image for me i think this looks good uh so i'll call it thumbnail one and once again i'll reload it now once again i'll copy this urls and i will paste it here let me call apple code and once again i'll say 160 by 160 160 by 160 and let me copy this and let me see if i get better images i'll keep on firing this until i get better images i think this image is good as well so let me copy this thumbnail too and let me see if i get a better image once again i think this looks good as well thumbnail [Applause] three and let me load my website now oh yes it looks good it looks amazing plus it loads faster than before okay so this website looks clean now mount encoders and then we have this thing and then once again we have white users if you want to increase the spacing between this my choosers and the images you can do that and i have told you how to do that we have this footer all right so this website looks good now now once again if we were to make some changes to the blog page what i'll do is i'll change the max height or rather min height of this page the minimum height that it should always have it's called min hide and not max side so let me go back to this page which is blog page.html uh bloghom.html i'm sorry so what i'll do is i will add a min height to my container which is holding all these posts okay so in order to do that what i'll do is i'll see where my container is which is holding all these posts it is here container so what i'll do is i'll create a new block and i'll say block css and i'll say block css and then tab and then i'll add the extra css here but before that i'll also have to add this block css inside my base.html so let me come back to base.html let me add it here because this is the place where i want to have my extra css the css that i'm going to add and what i'll do is i will say okay so i want to start a style tag and inside the style tag what i'll do is i'll say container should have or rather dot container because i want to target the class is equal to container element and i'll say the element with class container should have a min height of min high and it has to be atvh vh is viewport height if you don't know let me reload this and once i reload this it's still hanging up here so let me make it 100 vh and i think this should fix it okay so 100 vh fixes it and we get a scroller here but i think that's totally fine because in the future we'll have a lot of posts and we'll definitely have pg nation at place and we'll see how that will work but at this moment i think we are good with this page once again we'll go to contact page and we'll do the same thing so i'll add this extra css to my contact.html as well let me do that ctrl v ctrl s to save let me reload and see the magic the magic failed why okay so i don't have any container here i'll say dev dot container and let me add this this is my contact page here let me reload this okay so this is my contact page and i have this crawler you might as well change this to 95 vh if you think it's too much but i think 100 vh works fine as well okay so let me reload this i think 90 vh should work fine as well you can tweak this as per your requirement and if you like this scroller then you can keep 90 vh otherwise you can see what is the height of this thing and you can accordingly fix the height of your container whatever it comes out to be okay but i think this corner looks cool and and in the future we are anyway going to have this crawler in our website so i think that's totally fine and this looks totally good we have a mini description we have the blog we can customize it the way we want uh we changed the links and we added the colors and i think it totally looks fine and i'm really very happy the way it looks and it is a little bit off because i think i added the code between the headings but i think that's totally fine if you want to customize it just go back to your django admin and customize it the way you want okay so i think this mountain coders look amazing now we'll come back in the next video we'll design this contact page we have already designed the blog page we will add page edition as well and then i think we'll be good with the blog so i hope you guys are liking these videos if you are please access this playlist

",IN,https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AIdro_l9-HUf8RIfC8jJBhBi2dlVVLDjPkoRTHyXdPENsllX490=s800-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj,276000,113,guys previous video was fun we actually added tiny mce to a django blog without having to do many things and it was really fun to see this bold italic underline and all these options inside tinymce but do you know that we can see more options and we can get more customization from tiny mce by going to the documentation let's find out i'll simply search for tinymce and i'll go to the documentation i think here is the demo for tiny mce and they actually tell you a lot of things about tiny mce how you can add these options if you see we don't get these options so if you click at this preview you are seeing the preview here but for our case we are not seeing any preview and we would definitely love to see this preview button inside the django entering a blog okay the admin part of django blog at the same time it would be amazing to set the height of this box to something say seventy percent of the viewport height or maybe even bigger than that but definitely not this small okay so we'll see how we can customize all those things now there are a lot of plugins and people will make a lot of plugins in the future the main thing the main skill that you can learn is to look into the documentation and find out how to customize your say tiny mce or whatever software you are using as for your needs so what i'll do is i'll go and see what kind of customizations are provided by tinymce and it's showing me this javascript for this one so what i have done is i have simply added javascript which is a three line javascript i have just told that the selector is id underscore content and i want to select this but if you look into this one they are saying that we are using this we are using this we are using this a lot of options so let's see if we can grab all these options let me copy this code and let me paste it as it is so i'll get rid of my tiny mce dot init and i'll use this but at the same time i'll ensure that the selector i'm using is correct so i'll paste it here and let me see if it changes anything for me or it produces an error we'll have to ensure that it doesn't produce an error so i'll simply get rid of this one but this has definitely spoiled things for us so there are two errors it's saying that we cannot uh reference this thing we cannot so so there are some problems let's see what those problems are so they are saying mention selector mentions fetch so let me remove all these things so they are saying that tiny drive token provider i don't want to use dynee drive let me get rid of this one i just want to use these plugins i do not want to use the menu bar toolbar okay let me keep this at the same time i'll remove all these things i don't even know what these things are i just copied all the things from tinymce website so i'll remove this one and let me see if it works i just want to get it to work i don't want to dive deeper into tiny mce documentation and once again we see all these plug-in um messages that you don't have these plugins by an api key and this is really annoying who will see all these things but i think this this is really great and this is amazing and you might as well go to the website sign up for a free api key and i think if you get this api key you'll you'll see all these options and these are a lot of options i don't even know what these options are we can start exploring one by one let me select this text and this is the indentation nice what is this let me select some text and add this one okay so this is unordered list ordered list and this is an ordered list okay looks good okay looks good if i press enter another thing another thing wow this is amazing this is really amazing okay so we can choose some colors as well let me see if i can change the color nice and they have a color picker as well so you can choose any color of your choice this is really amazing and what is this page break okay so you can give a page break as well what is this oh this is a set of special symbols so you get a lot of things i'm really impressed with tiny mc while they have emojis as well i use them a lot i use them a lot while talking to friends or whenever i want to express something while i'm writing a blog they come really very handy so i'm really impressed with what tinymce has done and i can go to full screen as well this is really amazing i cannot appreciate it much preview wow this is good i think we have landed our blog to the right place and we can start writing amazing blog posts now starting my story once upon a time on new lists for dates new table so these are some templates that they have created i think you can also create some templates uh what is this insert link so if i want to link this to some uh okay so this this is insert template this is the link so i can say google.com and this is the link this this goes to google.com you can change the link as well you can ask it to open in a new tab or window wow this is amazing and what is this right to left okay or you want to go left to right insert edit code sample okay so you can add code as well this is something that i want this is something that i want because i write a lot of code and i really like inserting code and this will really come handy for me whenever i'm writing programming articles let me grab some python code from somewhere let me go to django documentation let me go to this thing and let me see if i can find out some python code from somewhere okay so i can copy this python code uh models.pv let's let's copy this and let's see how this looks here so i'll simply copy this save wow i'm really impressed by the way and this is amazing i should say and let me save this and see how my blog looks so i've saved this i'll reload this page another one and this is how it looks and yes you can customize your code by writing javascript and all those kind of stuff we'll see all these things in a future video sometime but this stuff is impressive and we can start writing amazing posts from now okay so one thing that we create problems for you is whenever you open something this tiny mce will start loading and you'll see whole bunch of these domain is not registered plug-in is not enabled all these things okay so let me see if i can remove some plugins that i'm not using that i don't want uh what is this linked list image list i don't even know what these things are let me start removing them one by one and probably i'll play around with this thing and i'll definitely learn what these things are but i think for now this is amazing and i really appreciate it a lot so if i remove all these things let me see what all options do i see i think i have made some mistake in the code i should make sure that this remains valid from code perspective so i can remove these templates i don't want these templates import css append i don't know what it is i'll remove all these things i'll remove this as well i'll remove this as well and let me keep these things only so let me save reload and the number of warnings that i'm seeing should reduce but looks like they haven't so i think we need to go and we need to start creating the free api keys whenever possible but for now what i'll do is i'll remove all the plugins that i don't need and i i'll start removing these menus as well title tiny comments at comment show comment delete all conversations what is that okay so there are some menus that can be created here they have a lot of stuff i think this is really very impressive so we can in the future play around with this and definitely we'll learn how to use this for now this has some steep learning curve uh you will have to write at least five to ten articles in order to find out how to optimally write your articles using this but this is going to be fun and also we'll have to go through the documentation and spend some time in order to find out what all options we should be using and what all options are free and we should be enabling in order to see no warnings or whatsoever so i'll leave that on you for now what i'll do is i will simply reduce the number of options in the toolbar and i'll also remove this menu i don't even know what these are doing here i have used tinymce in the past i have been using it for some time but i think i don't enable a lot of options and i don't even enable all these plugins uh plugins i'll remove this plugin and i'll also remove all these plugins i don't want to use all these plugins so i'll simply remove all the plugins and let me see how it looks and i think this is good to start with so all these are premium plugins actually i'll remove all the plugins i don't want any plugin so let me get rid of all these plugins and i think if i get rid of all the plugins this looks good to me okay so we can start with this and if we like maybe in the future if we want we can sign up for a free api key and even if we have to pay and if we start earning say three thousand dollars a month which is a lot of money if at all we are earning this amount of money in the future probably we can start giving some money to tiny mce as well i don't even know what the price of tiny mce is is there any um is there any option to see where the pricing and all those things are listed i don't know i can't find the pricing page where is the pricing page is it paid it it definitely is paid but i am not sure where pricing page is anyways okay so here is the pricing let us quickly look at the pricing so they are charging 25 dollars a month which is a lot of money community is free forever so you can use open source editor you know and love free forever and ready for commercial use so you can use this editor which is a good thing but i think the cloud plans are paid so we can use this um open source editor uh as and when required but the plugins are paid for sure so i think that is fine and we'll wrap this tiny mce but what i wanted to address through this video was i wanted to remove this paragraph tag the br tag because it doesn't look good there are two ways to remove this first way is to have a short description column here so if i add a short description column here i'll see that short description here but again you don't want to write the short description again and again you would want this chart description to be generated automatically okay so in order to do that what you can do is you can start looking into this uh whatever the html is being fetched from the database and you can analyze that html using javascript and generate the text automatically now since this is not a javascript tutorial i'll not do that because this will uh confuse you a lot if i start writing javascript so what i'll do is i'll add a short description field there so let us come back to models.py and inside the blog what i'll do is i'll say short underscore desc and i'll say models.carfield and i'll say max length is equal to how many characters should we add 300 i don't remember how many characters we added inside the blog home template so i think i have added around 200 or something i don't remember 245 so let me make it 250 okay so i'll say okay max length is 250 or maybe 300 and whenever i cross more than say 245 and that will automatically get truncated so that is totally fine with me i'll save this i'll stop the server i'll say python manage dot py make my questions [Applause] so this will make migrations i'll say uh it's saying that there is no default for this thing so what i'll do is i'll quit and add a default as well because it doesn't have a default so i'll say default is equal to none so it has added this short dse to block now i'll restart my server once again and i'll go back to my models and it is saying that no such column blog blog.desc so i think there is some problems okay so the problem is i just ran make migrations i should migrate as well because make migrations will just create the files for migration and migrate is the command which will actually do the magic of writing into the database so now the database has been changed and we'll get rid of this error hopefully so let me reload this page oh yes we have removed the error now what i'll do is i'll copy this and i'll add it to the short description and save now if i reload this still i'm seeing this thing because i am not pointing to the short underscore desc in my blog home template so i should say that i don't want blog dot content i want blog.esc and i want to slice it to 245 characters reload and this is what we see but once again we'll have to add short description to all the articles so i think it sounds like a good plan to add short description to all the articles ctrl c ctrl v and save once again i'll do the same with this article as well now you might want to go to tinymce and sign up for a free key the key is free i'm not doing it to save some time you can sign up with them and once you get the tiny mce key you can simply insert the key by looking into the documentation and if you do not want to do that that's totally fine i have ran a website without having to add the api key for like nine months i was too lazy i'm sorry but i think you should definitely add the tiny mce key it's worth it believe me learn javascript i'll add the chart description to this one as well copy paste save let me reload this yes this looks good this really looks good now the blog is looking so clean and we have this rich text editor as well i think this is the time you can take this block to production but again we have to fix some more things for example we have not added height to this one and once again we have not yet added uh static images to our to our homepage because if you don't use starting images your website is going to be slow because unsplash api is not going to give you images with that amount of speed which you can achieve using your own website using your own server so we'll come back and we'll make all these changes the home page looks good to me i think i think this looks good no problems whatsoever in my home page no problems whatsoever in the blog page except i need to add some height i need to add a form inside contact as well so we'll make sure that we have a contact page as well and once again we should have an about page as well which will tell about how mountain coders started and what kind of service mount encoders is is it uh is it a course website is it a website which will feature a lot of programming articles we will make sure we add that as well because people who are visiting the blog who are reading the articles they'll definitely want to know what you are about and what your website is about so they might come to the about page so it's a good idea to design an about page but i'll save time here because this is not a bootstrap tutorial i'll make a bootstrap tutorial if you post a comment please give us good start tutorials if if if i get say 100 comments i'll definitely make a bootstrap tool let's close the deal here 100 comments and you'll get a bootstrap tutorials on programming with harry so let me see if i get 100 comments on bootstrap tutorials and i'll show you how bootstrap 5 works in fact bootstrap 5 has come bootstrap 5 it has arrived uh let me open the documentation of bootstrap 5 alpha release and believe me bootstrap 5 is amazing i had a look at bootstrap 5 and i tried it out i don't know where the link to bootstrap 5 is ok so it's here v5 v5.getbootstrap.com and i liked it they removed jquery and they they are now using vanilla javascript this is amazing so you might want to have a look at mozart 5 but again we'll leave that to some other video i hope you're liking these django videos if you want me to continue this channel series i want you to share this playlist please because i need a lot of support on this channel i hope you guys will share this playlist with your friends and also if you haven't liked these videos i want you guys to like each and every video thank you so much guys for watching this video and i will see

your mountain coders blog what we have done so far is we have laid out the foundation of the blog we've made this homepage contact page this blog page we saw how we can enter the HTML inside our database and how we can pull it and display it as an HTML to the users of that he can easily read the content of what blog what I'm going to be doing now is I log in to my Django admin and at the same time what I'll do is let me write down admin here I'm already logged in I'll open my blogs and what I want to do at this point is I want to customize this content I want to add rich text editing to this website now if you don't know what rich text editing is had two tiny MCE website because this is going to be the rich text editor that I'm going to use so if you see the title it says the most advanced wys iwy gee you must be thinking what it is it is what you see is what you get so in in this HTML when you type something like this what you see is not what you get you see this but this is what you get but in case of rich text editors what happens behind the hood is it keeps the HTML away from the eyes of the users behind the scenes it generates HTML but it keeps it away from the eyes of the user now what do I mean by this let's have tiny MCE demo very quickly so I will go to get tiny MCE for free it's asking for signup I think we can use it without signing up if I'm not wrong you can come to tiny blog products tiny MCE so let me go to demos okay so this is a tiny MCE demo so if somehow I can embed this thing to my Django admin here it would be really great because then I'll be able to write and use all these bold italic underline and all these fonts features private is offering to my Django admin website and no-doubter to make my life easier so what I'll do is I will use this tiny MCE and we'll see how will embed to the Django admin but you must be thinking this HTML I'm talking about the entire page this entire page has not been written by us so how do we change this well we lose JavaScript to change the content of this page how do we do that initially what I'll do is I'll somehow add JavaScript to my console and test this thing but if somehow I can add a JavaScript file which executes when I open this page it would really be great so how to do that let's find out but before that I have only guys to get comfortable with rich text editor if you haven't used rich text editor ever in your life I want you to simply select this and make it bold make it italic make it say h3 and whatever features it is offering is asking me for some pictures but I don't think I want to add any picture I just wanted me add this picture let me see how it goes okay so this picture has been added and I can save if somehow I'm able to embed it to my Django admin but how do do all those things because definitely I'm not going to write HTML for every article that I produce I don't want to take the burden of writing HTML and formatting the UL li and this is not even giving me some sort of good editor and definitely I don't want to come back to visual studio code type my HTML and paste it back in here I want some rich text editing like this this will really make my life easy so how to do that let's find out so what I'll do is I'll go to examples so I'll go to basic example I'll say leave I don't want this content anymore so in order to find out how to use this thing I'll go to introduction and getting started I go to basic setup to be honest I also don't know how to use it because it's been a long time that I've used it but I will tell you how to use it while the documentation so first of all definitely will have to embed it to our website so the first step is to copy this code and copy this HTML and I think you are good now add your API key let me tell something about this so if you don't add your API key you will see this message popping up that this domain is not registered and this term it is not just a please register your domain all those messages will pop up but since this is not the front end this is not what end user will see oh we can't be in that burden but if you want to sign up and get your free API key you can do that but I am NOT doing that just for saving some time so what I'll do at this point is I'll create a new file now once again I'm creating a new file it will be created somewhere inside my project but it has nothing to do with my Django project okay I'll repeat this thing this file has nothing to do with my Django project I am just trying out tiny MCE in this file okay so let me copy this thing copy code and let me paste it somewhere here okay I'll save it with with the name tiny dot HTML I hope that name sounds good okay so what I'll do is I'll install an extension called live server if you haven't installed live server you can install live server okay so live server is an extension it's an amazing extension that I used to see my pages reload live when I change the content inside them so what I'll do is I'll click this go live button here and this is tiny Quick Start Guide okay so I see this this domain is not registered with tiny cloud please see the startup guide and get your account and whatever I'll close this thing because I don't want it I don't want to register and FaceTime but yeah if you want to use this in production you can go sign up with tiny MCE and get your key and and get rid of that message okay so let me see if this works yes this works let me Center it okay cool let me press ENTER and now let me start typing something we start typing something and change the font as well okay some typos here but who cares what I'll do is I will remove bold from here and at the same time what I'll do is I'll make this italic okay so this works this works pretty well okay so what I'll do now is I want this thing to somehow appear inside my say this Django admin now a question is why does this thing show up like this here let's understand the code that we just wrote so inside this code what we did is we added this a script that was provided by tiny MCE and then we said okay initialize my text area with ID my text area so this is a text area with this ID so what we are saying is we are saying that we want to use rich text editing inside my text area inside the text area which has the ID my text area and everything is automatically done by tiny MCE behind the scenes okay so if somehow I am able to add this script on this particular page in my Django admin and if somehow I'm able to find out the idea of this content I'll be able to add rich text editing to my Django admin so my question to you guys is is that thing clear to you the ID here is ID underscore content so I can target it with this ID but before that I need to inject this script inside the space somehow so well in order to add a script inside Django admin so in order to add the script to our back-end which is the page where we saw that content text area we'll come to our models dot py and we'll come to our admin store pure admin dot py sorry it's admin dot py and what we tell Django is that hey Django could you please add this JavaScript file to my say Django admin page which contains this model which is this particular page with blog model how do we do that is a good question and let's find out how to do that so I'll close this thing okay so in order to add some custom JavaScript or CSS to the speech what I'll do is I'll come back to my visual studio code and I'll add some static JavaScript to static folder so let me create a folder inside the static and inside this J's what I'll do is I'll add C blog dot J's and at the same time what I'll do is I'll add another folder got CSS if at all I want to add some CSS to my Django blog or rather this this particular page which contains the change blog text and all these text areas I can come back to this page and I can add the CSS just like I'm adding this J's so I'll tell you how to add CSS and at the same time I'll also tell you how to add JavaScript so what I'll do is I'll say console dot log this is blog tortillas so if we see this executed inside the console that means that we are able to successfully add this blog dot GS file to the model in order to add this blog dot J's file on this particular page what I'll do is I'll come back to my admin dot py and what I'll do is I'll say class so let me write class I'll say blog admin and what I'll do is I'll inherit it from admin dot model admin and then what I'll do is I'll say class and again I'll say media now this media is an inner class inside this media I can declare what sort of files do I need to add to my models I'll say add CSS files I can say at this particular J's file or whatever I want I can do using this media inner class now how do I at CSS files so all you have to do is you have to say CSS is equal to you have to initialize this stationary and you have to say all and at the same time what do you have to do is you have to just add the file name which is inside the CSS folder so what I'm doing is I'm giving the path inside this static folder to this CSS file okay so I'll say main dot CSS let me add this main dot CSS file so main dot CSS and at the same time what I'll do is and let me say h1 color red I'm using this funky color so that I can see that the CSS has been added to my page or not now what I'll do is I'll say GS is equal to and I'll give the name of the JavaScript while which I want to add so what I'll do is I'll say J a slash blog dot J's and let me reload this page and check the console so there are two messages in the console but I think this page has not yet been added to to this blog admin alright so there are a few things I want to fix here firstly I want to move this thing right after I create this class and I'll also have to register blog admin and now what I'll do is I'll also add a comma here note that the commas are necessary because this tuple contains only one item and when a Python couple contains only one item what you'll have to do is you'll have to add a comma it is necessary okay so let's restart the server once again and let's see what we have let's see if we see this message inside this home console or not so we don't have this message let's see if we have this static file I'll say 127.0.0.1 slash static slash blog dot J's okay so I think our static URL is not yet configured okay so I'll have to say J slash blog gorgeous ok so there's some problem with the static URL so let's go to mount encoder settings dot P Y and at the same time what we'll do is we'll see if we have these static files dirs I think it's called static files dirs that we'll have to set okay so it was there static files dirs oh it's called maduk files TI ASL copied from here and let me copy it from the django documentation so these are the things that you not remember always you'll have to come back to documentation and you'll have to copy pasted from here so do not hesitate from copy pasting all these things let me search it okay it's here let me find about it let me click this and see where I land okay so here it is so this is the list of all the directories which will contain your static files okay so we'll have to add it here let me add it here and I'll add just one file folder sorry and say static is going to be the folder where I'll have all my static files and let me see if this works now oh yes it works and let me see if this works now so I'll have to restart my triangle and let me see if it works it doesn't work there's something wrong I think I'm not able to add this blog tortillas okay so let me see what went wrong here I have not saved this admin dot py first of all if I reload this okay so we have this this is the blog dot GS and our h1 has also been changed to red color so quite a struggle there but again we are able to successfully add this javascript file to a Django model so all we did was we created this blog admin class and then we created a media inner class and then we added the CSS dictionary and J's tupple and you must be wondering where I got all this from so I just recall it out of my head because I have been coding in Django since a very long time but if you had to internet and you searched customizing the Django admin file let's so I had to internet and say Django model admin add CSS and J's and let me see if I am directly to this page or not I think I have already visited this page once and let me jump to model admin options and let me see if I can get that GSS okay so here it is we have this model admin asset definitions and it tells me that I can add this name of the model in an admin and then the in a class called media and and CSS inches but for now I think we are good we don't have to navigate to the documentation and spend time there what I'll do now is I'll add some JavaScript to this block gorgeous so that we can see a tiny MCE inside her Django gob model okay so what I'll do at this point is I'll change my blog dot GS so that I'm targeting my tiny MCE to work on this content text area so what I'll do is I'll come back to my visual studio code and let me had to blog dot GS so what I want to do here is I'll add the tiny MCE script first and then what I'll do is I'll say I want to add tiny MCE to this content text area and not to any other tiny temps your hashtag text area or whatever the default thing tiny MC provides is also what I'll do is I'll change this color back to normal so I'll add to my CSS file I created mean dot CSS and in future if I have to change my Django I had been interface I can come back to the CSS and make changes here so I hope you guys understood how tiny MCE walk in the next video we'll come back and we'll see how to integrate tiny MCE to this content so I hope you enjoyed this video and at the same time if you haven't already accessed this playlist I want you guys to do that this is the playlist where I'm adding the videos consistently and
