In the previous lecture, we have understood functions in C++. We got to know what a function is and we learned how to call a function, declare a function and define a function. Now we are in this lecture and the name of this lecture is default arguments of functions. So without any further delay, let's get started with this lecture and let's see what are the topics. The first topic of this lecture is default arguments. First we will properly understand what are default arguments and how do we use them. Then we will move to the next topic to understand some rules associated with default arguments that we need to remember. So these are the topics of this lecture. Let's start with the first one default arguments. So what are default arguments? Default arguments are default values for the parameters of a function provided at the time of its declaration or definition. So default arguments are the values that we pass to the parameters of the function at the time of declaration or definition of the function. And these arguments are automatically used by the compiler if the caller does not supply the arguments. If at all it is the case that we call the function without passing arguments to the parameters which has the default arguments, then the compiler will automatically assign default arguments for those parameters. Now let's understand how we can pass default arguments to a function. Let's take one simple example. We can pass default arguments to a function at the time of definition. Here is one example. Here I have defined the add function with these two parameters A and B. Parameter B has the default argument of one. Here the default argument is provided with the help of the assignment operator. This is how you can pass the default argument to a specific parameter. So when we call this function and if we choose to not provide the argument to this parameter then we can do this. In that case the compiler will automatically assign this default argument to this parameter. So this is the definition of the add function. Here we can observe the body of this function has return a + b. So this function will return the result of a + b. As mentioned already, we can provide default argument to a specific parameter at the time of the definition of the function or we can provide default argument at the time of declaration like this. Here is the declaration of the add function. You can observe the semicolon at the end. Here you can observe the default argument to this parameter B has been passed at the time of declaration. Here is the definition of this function and in the definition you can observe the default argument is not provided to B. This is because of the rule that we need to follow in case of default arguments. Here is the rule. Give default arguments either in the declaration or definition not both. This is the reason that when I have provided the default argument at the time of declaration then I have not provided the default argument at the time of definition. We need to follow this rule. We can either give the default argument to a parameter at the time of definition or at the time of declaration but not both. Here is one more important point to understand. We cannot use list initialization to provide the default argument. We need to use the copy initialization. Here I have used the assignment operator to provide the default argument. We cannot use list initialization here. Now let's see how to call these type of functions. Here is the call to this function. I have called this function add with two arguments two and three. These arguments will be received by these parameters. Please note that parameter B will receive value three not one because parameter B will receive the default argument when we do not provide the argument to parameter B from the caller. This is what I have mentioned here. The compiler will automatically assign the default argument to the parameter if the caller does not supply the argument. But here the caller has supplied the argument to parameter b. Therefore b will receive value three. So value of a is two and value of b is three. We will get the result five from this function. I hope this is clear to you. Now if we want we can call this function like this. I have called this function with just one argument. This argument will be received by parameter A. And this means we have not passed any argument to parameter B. So clearly compiler will automatically assign this default argument to parameter B. So we can say A is 2 and B is 1. In this specific case, we will get the value three from this function. So I have mentioned in the comment three to indicate that when we call this function we will get the output as three. So with this we have understood how to use default arguments in a function and how we can call these type of functions with default arguments. Now let's understand what's the use case of default arguments. Default arguments are mainly used when a new parameter needs to be added to the existing function. Let's say we already have some function in our program and we have called that function many times in the code. Now let's say we want to add a new parameter to our function. If we provide the new parameter to the function without passing in the default argument, then we need to update all the callers of the function because we cannot simply call the function without passing the value to the parameter which we have just added without the default argument. This will cause the error. Now to avoid this situation we can pass the parameter with the default argument. In this way we do not have to update the existing function calls. We can call this function by passing argument to the new parameter added or we can choose to not pass argument to the parameter because we have provided the parameter with default argument. I hope this idea is clear to you. So default arguments are mainly used in those situations when we already have some function and we need to pass new parameter to that function. We can pass that parameter with the default argument. So with this we have understood default arguments properly. This means we are done with the first topic. Now let's move to the second topic to understand some rules associated with default arguments that we need to remember. Here is the rule number one. Default arguments must be assigned from right to left. We must always provide default arguments to the parameters from right to left not left to right. And there is the strong reason behind this which we now understand with the help of an example program. Here is the example program. I have defined this add function here. And here is the definition of the main function. Inside this main function I have written this stdc outline. And here I am calling the add function with just one argument three. Now here you can observe these parameters. We have A and B as parameters and parameter A has the default value. Parameter B does not have a default value. This is not allowed in C++ because we cannot assign default arguments to parameters from left to right. We cannot provide the default argument to parameter A and leave parameter B without default argument. We will get error from the compiler. Now why are we getting the error? What's the reason behind this? Let's understand this through this example. Here I'm calling the add function with value three. In reality, I want to pass this value to parameter B. But I cannot do this. This value will be provided to parameter A and not parameter B. This means I cannot call this function without passing values to these two parameters. I have to do this. If at all I want to call this function by passing the argument to just parameter B then I cannot do this. Understand that the compiler will take this value and provide this to parameter A. Now what about parameter B? To this parameter we have not passed any value and this parameter does not have a default argument. So clearly if we call this function like this then we will get error from the compiler. So we can say this default argument is of no use. We have to call this function by passing two values to these parameters. So we cannot leverage this specific default argument. This is the reason why we must pass default arguments from right to left. So this definition is perfectly fine. Here in this definition of the add function, you can observe in this definition that parameter B has the default argument but parameter A has been left without any default argument. This is allowed in C++. Now if we call this add function by passing just one argument this argument will be received by parameter A and parameter B will receive this value 10. So we will get the output as 13 for this program. We will not get the error. This is because we have provided the default arguments from right to left not left to right. I hope this idea is clear to you. So with this we have understood the rule number one. We must pass the default arguments from right to left not left to right. Now here comes the rule number two. Argument cannot be skipped in between. If we want we cannot skip an argument in between. Now to understand this concept, let's take one example program. Here in this example program, I have defined this new version of the add function with these three parameters and these three parameters have default arguments. Now here is the definition of this function. Here I have written return a + b + c. So I want to add the values of these parameters and I want to return the result to the caller. Here is the main function and here is the std seeout statement with this call to the add function. Here you can observe that I am skipping an argument in between. This means I am skipping the argument which I need to provide to this parameter B. This is not allowed in C++. This syntax is not correct. We will get error from the compiler. We cannot even do this. We cannot pass arguments to parameter B and C without passing argument to parameter A. Here also we will get error from the compiler. When we need to pass arguments at the time of calling the function, we must pass the arguments from left to right. That's the rule we need to follow. We cannot skip the arguments in between and we can also not skip the first argument and provide arguments for the remaining parameters. We can call this function in these ways. We can call this function without passing any arguments. This is allowed because we have default arguments for all these parameters. We can call this function by passing just one argument like this. This argument will be received by variable A or parameter A and the remaining parameters will receive these default arguments that is two and three. What about this function call? These two arguments will be received by parameters A and B and parameter C will receive the default argument three. And when we call this function with three arguments, then these three arguments will be received by these three parameters. So these are the ways in which we can call this function. And for this specific program we will get the output 6 15 33 and 16. You can verify this on your own. Why are we getting this output? I hope this is completely clear to you. So the conclusion is simple. We need to remember this thing that when we pass default arguments to the parameters then we must pass them from right to left. But when we pass arguments at the time of calling the function then we must pass the arguments from left to right. I hope this idea is completely clear to you. You need to remember this rule. So with this we have understood all the rules that we need to remember about default arguments and this means we are done with the second topic also. This means we are done with this lecture. Okay friends, this is it for now. Thank you for watching this lecture. I will see you in the next one. [Applause] [Music]"",unknown        "

In this lecture, we will understand functions in C++. So without any further delay, let's get started with this lecture and let's see what are the topics. The first topic is introduction to functions. First I will introduce you to functions. Then we will understand how to define a function, call a function and declare a function. So these are all the topics. Let's start with the first one. Introduction to functions. So what is a function? A function is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task. So think of a function as a block of code which you can reuse as many times as you want and it has the capability to perform some task on its own. So we can imagine a function as a machine which can accept inputs. It can operate on those inputs and then it produces an output. Let's take an example to properly understand this. Let us assume we want to add two numbers. For this purpose we can define a function add like this. This add function can receive inputs. The two inputs we pass to this function let's say are 20 and 50. This function will operate on these inputs and then it produces the output 70. We are getting 70 because 20 + 50 is 70. So with this we have understood what a function is. Now let's see what are the different types of functions we have in C++. We have two types of functions. We have predefined functions and userdefined functions. Predefined functions are those functions which are already defined for us. We do not have to define them. This means we do not have to write code for them. We can directly use those functions in our code if we want. Let's say we want to calculate square root of a number. We already have the function for the same. The function name is sqrt. Similarly, if you want to calculate x power y, we have the function for the same which is called pow. To this function, we can pass the inputs x and y. If we want to know whether a specific character is an alphabet or not, we have the function which is called is alpha to do this job. If we want to know what's the length of the string, then we have the function str len to calculate the length of the string. So these are all the predefined functions. These functions are already defined for us. We can directly use these functions in our code. But what if we want to define our own functions? We may want to do this because we do not have any predefined function for the job that we want to do. In this case, obviously we want to define our own functions and we can do that. These type of functions are called userdefined functions. As the name itself suggests these functions are called userdefined. This means these functions are defined by the user or programmer. The focus of this lecture is to understand how to define our own functions and how to use them whenever we want to. So in this lecture in the subsequent topics we will properly understand how to define our own functions and how to use them. So with this we are done with the introduction to functions. Now let's move to the second topic to understand how to define a function. Let's first understand the meaning of defining a function. Defining a function is same as writing the code for the function that specifies how the function performs its task. So when we define a function, we write the code for that function which is responsible to perform the task on behalf of the function. Now here is the syntax of defining a function in C++. We need to specify the return type. First this return type represents the type of the output returned by the function. Then we need to provide the name of the function. Then within parenthesis we can provide the parameters which are the inputs to the function. We can provide as many parameters as we want. and then within braces we define the function body. Function body represents the code which is responsible to perform the task on behalf of the function. I hope this syntax is clear to you. Now let's implement this syntax. Let's understand how to implement this behavior in C++ programs. Let's define a function add. Here is the definition of the function add. Name of the function is add. Return type is int. This means this function will return an integer output. The parameters are also integer parameters. Here we have a and b. And here is the body of this function. We have return a + b. This function has the capability to add a and b and then return the result. So obtained. So that's the function definition in C++. Here we have defined the add function. So with this we have understood how to define a function. But defining a function is not enough. If we have a program and if we define a function then it is not enough because the function will not execute on its own. We need to call the function to execute it. And this is exactly what we will learn in the next topic. For now, we are done with defining a function. Now, let's understand how to call a function. Calling a function means asking the function to execute its task. So, when we call a function, we ask the function to simply execute. And we can call a function from the main function or from some other function. That is what I have written here. A function can be called from the main function or some other function. Here is the syntax to call a function. We need to specify the name of the function first. Then within parenthesis we can provide the arguments based on the parameters we have defined. So the number of arguments must match with the number of parameters we have defined for the function. At the end we need to put the semicolon. So when we call the function we do not specify the return type. We simply write the name of the function and within parenthesis we provide the arguments. These arguments are the actual values we pass to the function. Now let's consider the add function and let's call that function. For this purpose, let's write the program. Here is the complete program. I have included the IO stream header file. And here is the definition of the add function. After this definition, we have the definition of the main function. And inside this main function, I have written this stdc outline. And here I am calling the add function. You can compare this call with this syntax. Here I have specified the name of the function. Then within parenthesis I have provided the actual values which are the arguments. These arguments will be passed to these parameters. When we call a function, the control shifts to the definition of the function. So from the main function now we move to the definition of this add function. These parameters A and B will receive values three and four respectively. This means variable A will receive three and variable B will receive four. Now we know this add function will add these numbers. We will get seven and this value will be returned to the caller only. So that's the meaning of this statement. Return a + b means return the result of a + b to the caller of the function add. This means this caller will receive value seven. So here in place of add 3a 4 7 will be available. This will be available at runtime. So when we execute this program we know we will get the output 7. I hope this is clear to you. So in this way we can call a function. When we call a function we'll be able to execute that function. Without executing a function a function is of no use. Now here you can observe one thing. I have defined this function before this main function. And this is important to do because whenever we call a function, its definition must be available before it. That is why I have defined this function before the main function. But what if we want to define this function after this main function? This can be the requirement. Maybe we want that the main function should be available at the top of the program always. then we need to define this function after the main function. Now if we shift this function after the main function then we will get error from the compiler. This is because compiler reads the code from top to bottom. It has to see the definition of the function first before calling the function. Therefore, writing this code is correct. And we cannot shift this function after the main function like this. If we want to shift this function after the main function, then we need to declare this function before calling the function. This is exactly what we will learn in the next topic. For now, we are done with calling a function. This means we are done with this topic. Now let's move to the fourth topic which is about declaring a function. Declaring a function means telling the compiler about the name, return type and types of parameters of the function. So when we declare a function, we inform the compiler about the name of the function, the return type of the function and the types of parameters of the function. So we can say that it allows us to define a function after it is called. When we declare a function, we would be able to define the function after it is called. This is the importance of declaring a function. Now here is the syntax to declare a function. We need to specify the return type first. then the name of the function and within parenthesis we need to provide the parameters of the function and at the end the semicolon will come not the braces that's the difference between declaration and definition. In case of definition, we always have braces and within braces we provide the code of the function because we want to define the function. But when we declare the function, we end this statement with semicolon. We do not add braces. So that's the declaration. We just tell the compiler about the name of the function, the return type of the function and also the types of the parameters of the function. Now let's take the same example program to understand how to declare the function. Here is the example program we took in the last topic. Here we have the definition of the add function which is available before calling the function. Now let's say we want to define this function after the main function. As I have mentioned this already, we cannot do this. Now if we do this, we will get error from the compiler. But if we want to really shift this function to the bottommost place of this program, then we need to declare this function before calling this function like this. Here I have declared the add function with these parameters and this return type. At the end we have the semicolon. This semicolon is telling us that this is the declaration not the definition. Now here you can observe this declaration is available before calling the function. So it is perfectly valid. And here you can observe the definition of the add function is available after the main function. Now there is no problem. We will get the output seven as expected. With this declaration we are telling the compiler that the definition of this function is available somewhere in the code. Don't worry at all if I call the function. Now I would like to mention that we do not have to specify the name of the parameters here. This is not mandatory because compiler has to do nothing with these names. Compiler is only interested in the types of the parameters. Therefore, we can remove these names. And this is how our declaration looks like. This is also the valid declaration. Now, when we execute this program, we will get the same output seven. So with this we have properly understood the significance of declaring a function. This means we are done with the last topic also and we are done with this lecture. Okay friends, this is it for now. Thank you for watching this lecture. I will see you in the next one.

In the previous lecture, we learned loops in C++. We got to know that with the help of a loop, we can execute a block of code as many times as we want. Now we are in this lecture and the name of this lecture is break and continue. In this lecture, we will understand the importance of the break and continue statement within a loop. So without any further delay, let's get started with this lecture and let's see what are the topics. The first topic is the break statement and the second topic is the continue statement. So these are the topics. Let's start with the first one, the break statement. So what is the break statement? Break statement is the statement that is used to exit a loop or a switch statement. So if we want to exit from a loop that too when the loop is executing and if we want to exit from a switch statement then we can use the break statement. We have already used the break statement with a switch statement we know how to use it. Now let's understand how to use the break statement with a loop. For this purpose let's consider a simple C++ program. Here is the C++ program and with the help of this C++ program I want to calculate the sum of all the numbers entered by the user. When the user enters minus1 then the sum will be displayed on the screen. For this purpose I have defined these two variables num and sum. They are zero initialized. And then I have written this while loop and here the condition is true. This means this while loop will run forever. This is because the condition never becomes false and this means this while loop will not terminate and therefore this is an infinite while loop. Here we have these two statements. Now with the help of these two statements I want to receive a number from the user. This message will be displayed on the screen. enter a number minus one to exit user will provide some number which will be received in the num variable now here I'm checking this condition if num is equal to minus1 then we will break from this loop we know this is an infinite loop this means this loop will run forever but if this condition is true that is if the user input is minus1 then the break statement ment will encounter and this means this loop will terminate at this point. So with the help of break statement we can terminate a loop. If the number is not minus1 then this statement will execute. This means sum equal to sum + num will execute. Whatever the number we will receive in the num variable will be added to the value of the sum variable and the result will then be stored in the sum variable only. So in this way the sum variable will hold the sum of all the numbers entered by the user except minus one because when num is minus1 then the loop will break and we will never reach this line. At this point, this statement will execute and sum will be displayed on the screen. Now let's execute this program. This message will be displayed. Enter a number minus one to exit. Let's provide the number 10. And let's hit enter. We will receive the same message because this loop will run once again. Here minus1 is not entered. Therefore, these two statements will execute and we will get the same message. Now, let's provide the number 20. At this moment, when we hit enter, the sum variable will hold the sum of these two numbers that is 30. After hitting enter, we will get the same message. Now, let's provide these inputs. After hitting enter at this moment we will get the sum of all these numbers in the sum variable which is 150 and let's say after hitting enter we provide the number minus one. Now as we have provided minus1 this condition is true and therefore we will exit this while loop because of this break statement. And now the sum will be displayed on the screen which is equal to 150. I hope this is clear to you. So with the help of a break statement we can terminate an infinite loop. We can terminate a kind of a loop which will not terminate on its own with the help of a break statement. So it is quite useful. So with this we have understood the break statement. This means we are done with the first topic. Now let's move to the second topic to understand the continue statement. So what is the continue statement? The continue statement is used to skip the current iteration and it allows us to move to the next iteration. So if we want to skip the current iteration that is if we do not want to execute some statements after the continue then we can do that by using the continue statement. it will skip the current iteration and it allows us to move to the next iteration. This can be better understood through an example. Let's say we want to print all the odd numbers between 1 to 10. This can be done through a for loop. We can write a for loop with let's say a loop variable i. This variable will receive values from 1 to 10. Now within the for loop we can check the condition whether the variable i is holding an even number or not. If the variable i is holding an even number then the number will not be displayed on the screen. We will simply continue to the next iteration. Otherwise we will display the number on the screen. In this way we would be able to skip all the even numbers and display only the odd numbers. Now here is the example program for the same. Here I have included this for loop within this main function. And here this for loop will run from i = 1 to i = 10. Now here I'm checking this condition is i mod 2=0. This means I'm checking whether the variable i is holding an even number or not. If variable I is holding an even number then we will continue to the next iteration. This means this std see out statement will be skipped and we will move to the next iteration that is to the update expression. This is the meaning of skipping the current iteration and moving to the next iteration. Now if the number is not an even number then the stdcout statement will execute and this means the odd number will be displayed on the screen along with the wide space. Now we know when we execute this program we will get the output 1 3 5 7 9. All the even numbers are skipped and only the odd numbers are displayed. This has happened because of the continue statement. It allows us to skip the current iteration. That is it allows us to skip the statements after the continue and it allows us to move to the next iteration. So with this we have understood the continue statement. This means we are done with the second topic also and this means we are done with this lecture. Okay friends, this is it for now. Thank you for watching this lecture. I will see you in the next one.

In the previous lectures, we have understood if, else and switch statements. Those were the control structures and we know with the help of these statements, we can check a specific condition and based on the condition we can execute a block of code. Now we are in this lecture and the name of this lecture is loops in C++. This is also a type of a control structure which we will study in this lecture. So without any further delay, let's get started with this lecture and let's see what are the topics. The first topic is introduction to loops. First I will introduce you to the world of loops. Then we will understand the for loop, the while loop and the dowhile loop. So these are the topics of this lecture. Let's start with the first one that is introduction to loops. So what are loops? A loop is something that allows us to repeat a block of code multiple times. With the help of a loop, we can repeat a block of code as many times as we want and that too without putting in much manual effort from our side. To understand the significance of a loop, let's consider one scenario. Let's say we want to display the message hello on the screen that two 10 times. Now, if you have no idea about a loop, then we may choose to write the code like this. We will write the stdcout statement 10 times to display hello on the screen. Now we know with the help of this code hello will be displayed 10 times. But is this approach an efficient approach? No. Right? This approach is not efficient because we need to write the same statement multiple times. If at all we need to print hello on the screen 100 times. Then we need to write the std out statement 100 times. This is not at all an efficient approach. This requires a lot of manual effort from our side. Therefore, it is important to have a construct that allows us to repeat a block of code and loop is here for the rescue. We can convert this block of code to its equivalent for loop like this. This is one type of a loop called the for loop. We will study the syntax of the for loop properly later in this lecture. For now, just understand that with the help of this for loop, we would be able to print hello on the screen 10 times because here we have specified the value 10. Now the beauty of this for loop is that if we want to display the message hello times, then we just need to replace 10 by 100 and the job is done. So this loop will take care of printing hello 100 times on the screen if we provide 100 in place of 10 here. So clearly this code is much efficient. It requires less manual effort from our side and therefore it is a great replacement for the code that we have written over here. So I hope with this the significance of a loop is clear to you. Now let's see what are the different types of loops we have in C++. We have three types of loops in C++. We have the for loop, the while loop and the dowhile loop. We will study these three different types of loops in this lecture. For now we are done with the introduction to loops. This means we are done with the first topic. Let's move to the second topic to understand the for loop properly. Now what is the for loop? For loop is the loop that allows us to execute a code block that based on some condition. So there is the conditional execution. based on some condition the code block will execute and it is the case that first the condition is checked and then the code block will execute. This means if the condition is true then only the code block will execute and it will continue to execute because this is a loop. Now for loop is mainly used in those situations when the number of iterations are known in advance. If we already know how many times we need to repeat a block of code then we can use the for loop because for loop is mainly used in those situations when we already know the number of repetitions or we can say number of iterations before hand. I hope this idea is clear to you. So now let's take one simple example to understand how to use the for loop in C++ programs. Here I have written the program. Here with the help of this program we can display hello 10 times on the screen. Here I have written the for loop for the same purpose. Now let's understand how this for loop works. First we need to specify the for keyword within parenthesis we can specify three things. First we can specify the initialization statement. This is the initialization statement because here we are initializing this variable I with value one. Then after this we can provide the conditional expression. Here we have the condition I less than or equal to 10. And lastly we can provide the update expression. Here I have provided I ++. This means I will be incremented by one every time. Within braces we can provide the code which we want to repeat. Here I have provided this line of code because I want to display hello a certain number of times. Now let's understand how this for loop works. First the initialization statement will execute. This means I is initialized to one. Then the condition is checked. We know 1 is less than 10. Therefore this condition is true. Now the update expression will not execute. This is not the sequence followed by the for loop. After checking the condition, the body of the loop will execute. This is the body of the loop within braces. Here we have just a single statement. This statement will execute after checking the condition. We know the condition is true. Therefore, this statement will execute and we will see hello for the first time on the screen. Then after this I ++ will be evaluated. So that's the flow. Initialization condition then loop body execution and then the update expression. Now I ++ will happen. This means I is incremented by 1. We know the current value of I is 1. Now it becomes two. Now again the condition will be checked. This means we will compare 2 and 10. We know 2 is less than 10. Therefore this condition is true. As this condition is true, the loop body will execute once again. And this means hello will be displayed for the second time. Again I ++ will happen. I becomes three. Now three is compared with 10. 3 is less than 10. Therefore the statement will execute once again and we will see hello for the third time. In this way the process continues until I becomes 11. When I becomes 11, this condition becomes false. And because this condition is false, we will get outside of this for loop. So this is how this for loop works. We will get this output on the screen because this loop executes 10 times. I is initialized to one and here we are checking I less than or equal to 10. Clearly this loop runs from 1 to 10. This means this loop runs 10 times and that's why we are seeing this message 10 times. So with this we have understood how the for loop can be used in C++ programs. With the help of the for loop we can repeat a statement or a set of statements a certain number of times. We mainly use the for loop when the number of iterations are known in advance. Here we already know how many times we want to repeat this statement. That's why we can use the for loop. So with this we have understood the concept of the for loop. This means we are done with the second topic also. Now let's move to the third topic to understand the while loop. Now what is the while loop? The while loop is the loop that allows us to execute a block of code based on some condition just like for loop and it checks the condition first and then it executes the code block. So it works exactly the same like the for loop. But there is one difference. We mainly use the while loop when the number of iterations are not known in advance. So functionality wise for loop and while loop are same. They work exactly the same. But we mainly use the while loop when the number of iterations are not known to us at the time of writing the code. When we know the number of iterations beforehand, then it is advisable to use the for loop. Although we can use the while loop as well, but it is advisable to use the for loop because for loop is more readable and understandable in this case. When we do not know the number of iterations beforehand, then it is advisable to use the while loop. I hope this is clear to you. Also I want to mention this that because the functionality of the for loop and the while loop are same. We can convert a for loop to its equivalent while loop and we can also convert a while loop to its equivalent for loop. This can be done. So the for loop we have written before can easily be converted to its equivalent while loop. Now let's see how to do this. Here I took the same example program. We have this for loop which we know runs 10 times and therefore the message hello will be displayed 10 times. Now we can easily convert this for loop to its equivalent while loop. For this purpose first we need to move this initialization statement to the top. Now we have the initialization statement over here. Then we need to shift this update expression at the end of the body of the loop. So now I ++ comes here just before this closing brace. Now we just have this condition within parenthesis. Here we need to replace this for by the keyword while and that's it. We have obtained the equivalent while loop. I hope this is clear to you. This while loop works exactly the same as the for loop which we saw before. There's only the structural difference. Here the initialization will happen. It happens only once just like for loop. After this the condition is checked. If this condition is true then the loop body will execute just like the for loop. And of course the update expression will execute after executing this line of code. Then after this the condition is checked once again. If this condition is again true then this statement will execute once again and the update expression will also execute. So functionality wise both for loop and while loop are same. There is only the structural difference between the two. For these type of situations, it is advisable to use the for loop because we would be able to see initialization statement, conditional expression and update expression in the same line. Therefore, it is easier to manage them and read them. In situations when we don't know the number of iterations beforehand, we use the while loop. Here I have demonstrated that we can easily convert a for loop to a while loop and we can use while loop in those situations as well when the number of iterations are known to us. Now we know what's the output. We will get the same output. We will get hello 10 times on the screen. I hope this is completely clear to you. Now let's justify this point. Here I have written we use while loop when the number of iterations are not known in advance. Let's take an example for the same. Let us suppose we want to ask the user to enter a choice. It can be Y or N. Y means yes and N means no. If the choice is Y then the loop will execute and therefore the user will be asked again to enter the choice. If the choice is n then we will exit the loop and some message will be displayed on the screen. Now here we can observe that the number of iterations we do not know beforehand because we don't know what is entered by the user. So clearly here we do not know the number of iterations and therefore it is advisable to use the while loop in this situation. Let's use the one here. I have written the code to ask the user to provide a choice and based on the choice the while loop will execute. Here you can observe that I have defined variable choice of type care. And here I have written these two statements to ask the user a choice and receive the choice. Now here I have written the while loop. The condition is choice not equal to n. If choice entered by the user is not equal to n then the loop will continue and execute these two statements. This means we will again ask the user to enter the choice. If the choice turns out to be n then this condition becomes false and we will exit the while loop. In this case this statement will be displayed. We will get this message exit. Now let's execute this program. Here you can observe we got enter your choice Y or N. Let's enter Y and let's press the enter button. We would be able to see this message once again because of this while loop. As this condition is true, these two statements will execute once again. Now let's provide Y once again and let's hit enter. We will get the same message. This time let's provide N. Now when we hit enter we know that this condition is false and therefore this message will be displayed next. I hope this program is completely clear to you. From this program we can observe how we can use the while loop when the number of iterations are not known to us at the time of writing the code. Now here is the quick exercise for you. As I have already mentioned this, we can convert a for loop to its equivalent while loop and we can do the vice versa as well. I really want you to convert this while loop to its equivalent for loop. Here is the hint for you. We do not have to specify the initialization statement and the update expression because they are optional. I want you to do this exercise and I want you to post your answers in the comment section as well after completion of this lecture. Now let's get back to this lecture. Here we have written these two statements to ask the user a choice and to receive the choice in the variable choice. And you can observe these two statements are repeated over here as well. So there is the repetition. Whenever we have a repetition in the code, it is advisable to optimize the code to reduce the repetition because repetition is not good. We must always try to reduce the repetition. Here we have the repetition. Can we reduce this? Is there a way to optimize this program? We will understand this while studying the dow while loop in the next topic. For now, we are done with the while loop. This means we are done with the third topic as well. Now, let's move to the fourth topic to understand the dowh loop. Now, what is the dowhile loop? Do while loop also allows us to execute a code block based on the condition. This means it works just like for and while loop but it executes the code block first and then the condition is checked. So it is bit different from the for loop and while loop. Here the condition is checked after executing the code block. This means the code block will execute at least once and it is mainly used when the number of iterations are not known in advance just like the while loop. Now let's try to optimize the code which we have written before in case of while loop with the help of the dowh loop. With the help of this dowh loop we can reduce the repetition. Let's see how. Here is the same code we have written before. As I have mentioned this already, we have the repetition over here. We can reduce this by using the dowhile loop. Understand what is happening here. We want to check a specific condition in the while loop. Now, this condition depends on the user's choice. This means we need to ask the user to enter the choice first and then the condition must be checked and after checking the condition we need to again ask the user to enter the choice when the condition turns out to be true. This type of situation can easily be handled by the dowhile loop because in dowhile loop we can check a specific condition after executing a code block. So here we can replace this while loop by dowhile loop. For this purpose we do not need these two statements. So we can remove them. Now we have this while loop. We can replace this by dowh loop. We need to shift this while statement to the bottom after this closing brace like this. And we need to place a semicolon here. Now we can specify the do keyword here. So now we have the dowh loop. This is how the dowhile loop looks like. Here these statements will execute at least once. First these statements will execute. This means we will ask the user to enter the choice. We will receive the choice in the choice variable. Then after this the condition is checked. This is the order that is followed here. Now if the condition is TRUE then the choice will be asked again otherwise we will exit this dowh loop and this message will be displayed. So this code will work exactly the same as the code we saw in case of the while loop. And here also we will get the similar output. I hope this concept is clear to you. We have optimized our code. We have reduced the repetition. This block of code has been written just once because of the dow while loop. So with this we have understood the dowhile loop as well and we now know what's the importance of the dowhile loop. So with this we are done with the fourth topic and this means we are done with all the topics of this lecture. Okay friends this is it for now. Thank you for watching this presentation. I will see you in the next one. [Applause] [Music]"","

In the previous lecture, we have understood the if else statement. Now we are in this lecture and the name of this lecture is switch statement. In this lecture, we will understand our second control structure. So without any further delay, let's get started with this lecture and let's see what are the topics. The first topic of this lecture is introduction to switch statement. First I will introduce you to switch statement. Then we will move to the second topic to understand important points associated with the switch statement. Finally I will explain the fall through behavior of the switch statement as well. So these are the topics. Let's start with the first one that is introduction to switch statement. Now what is switch statement? The switch statement allows us to choose between different options based on the value of a single variable or an expression. So to the switch we can pass a single variable or an expression. Based on the value of the single variable or an expression we would be able to evaluate a specific option of the switch. This can be better understood with the help of the syntax of the switch statement. Here is the syntax. We first need to specify the keyword switch. Within parenthesis, we need to provide a single variable or an expression. Based on the value of the expression or a single variable that we pass here, a specific case will be evaluated. Here we will have the equality comparison. The value of the single variable or an expression is compared with these constants. If it is the case that the value matches with constant one, then the statements of this case will execute. If the value matches with constant two, then the statements of this specific case will execute. If it is the case that the value is not matching with any constant that we specify here, then the default case will execute. This means the statements within default case will execute. So this is how the switch statement works. Now it seems like the behavior of the switch can easily be mimicked by the if else if letter. Through if else if letter we can check multiple conditions. We can compare a single variable or an expression with a constant and that too with equality comparison. This can also be done with the help of if else if letter. Then why do we use switch statement? The same behavior can be achieved through if else if letter but this is not advisable to do so. When we have the equality comparison that is when we want to compare a single variable or an expression with a constant and the comparison is equality then it is advisable to use switch because it is more readable and understandable. If we compare it with if else if letter this is more readable. In case of if else if letter, if we have multiple conditions to check, then it becomes so clumsy that it becomes difficult to read if else if. Therefore, it is advisable to use switch when the comparison is equality. If any other relational comparison we want to do, then we can use if else if letter. Only for equality comparison we can use switch. I hope this idea is clear to you. So now it is completely clear where do we use switch and where do we use if else if. Now let's take an example program to properly understand the implementation of the switch statement. Here is the program. Here I have included the IO stream header file and inside this main function I have defined variable light of type care with this character R. I am representing this as the traffic light. Right now the light is red. This variable is passed to the switch. So this is the switch variable. Now we know that the value of this variable is compared with these case constants. We know that R is matching with this R. Therefore the statements of this case will execute. Here we have the stdcout statement and therefore we will get stop on the screen. After this we have the break statement. Because of this break statement, we will get outside of this switch. Break statement allows us to break out of the switch or to exit the switch. So this statement is needed if we want to execute just one case. And you can observe this that break statement is part of the switch syntax. So we need to include it to execute just one case. If this break statement is not available then the subsequent case will also execute. This might not be an intentional behavior. So I hope this idea is clear. Now when we execute this program we know we will get the output as stop. So with this we have understood the concept of switch and now we know where do we use switch. With this we are done with the introduction to switch statement. Now let's move to the second topic to understand some important points associated with the switch statement. Here comes the first point integral switch expression expression in switch must be an integral value. It can be int, car, enum etc. or an expression that evaluates to an integral value. Now what does this statement mean? The expression or a single variable that we pass to switch must yield an integral value. It can be of type int, it can be of type care or it can be of type enum. We know that int represents an integer. So it always yields an integral value. This means it yields an integer. What about k? We know the internal representation of a character is an integer. Therefore, from here also we will get an integral value. Similarly, enum also gives us an integer value. We already know this. So clearly switch expression must yield an integral value or it must be an expression that evaluates down to an integral value. Let's take an example to properly understand this. Here we have this example program. Within this main function, I have defined variable where of type integer with value two. This variable is an integer variable. We can pass this variable to switch. So now this is a switch variable. This variable will yield an integral value. Therefore, there is no problem in passing this variable to switch. Now, within these braces, we have these cases and the default case. We know that the variable V is holding value two. Therefore, case 2 is the matching case and hence case two will be displayed on the screen. And because of this break statement, the default case will not execute. We will get outside of this switch. We now know what's the output of this program. We will get case two as the output. So we are done with point number one. Let's move to point two. Constant case label. Case labels must be integral constants. We know that the switch expression must yield an integral value. It can be a variable also. But case labels cannot be variables. They must be integral constants. Now let's see the example program to understand this properly. Here I took the same example program which we took in point number one. Here we have these case labels and you can observe these are integral constants. We can have characters as well. those are also integral constants because their internal representations are integers. But here we cannot have variables. A variable is allowed as the switch expression but we cannot use a variable as a case label. So here let's say if we define variable x like this and in place of two if we write x here then we will get error from the compiler. So that's point number two. Now here comes point number three. Break prevents fall through. If break is not used at the end of the case the execution continues to the next case. This is the fall through behavior in C++. If we do not specify the break statement, then the subsequent cases will also execute until we encounter the break statement. This is the fall through behavior and break statement prevents fall through behavior. Here is the example program. We took the same example. Here you can observe we have break statements after each case. Now let's say we remove this break statement. Then we have case two and immediately after this we have the default case without break in between the two. Now we know without the break statement the default case will also execute and therefore we will get the output case two and invalid because we know variable v is holding value two and it is matching with case 2. So that's point number three. We must add break statement to avoid fall through behavior. So we have understood all the three points associated with switch statement. This means we are done with the second topic also. Now let's move to the third topic to understand the fall through behavior. Now what is the fall through behavior? We already know this fall through behavior occurs when the break statement is not available at the end of the case and execution continues to the next case. Now one thing we don't know is that compiler may generate warning as this is general not an intentional behavior. It is possible that compiler may generate warning if we have the fall through behavior of a specific switch. Now if we do not want the compiler warnings that is if we want the fall through behavior should be an intentional one then we need to provide the attribute fall through. This fall through attribute allows us to implement the fall through behavior without having any compiler warnings. Now we can understand this properly through an example program. Here is the example program. I have defined the main function and within this main function I have defined variable v with value one. This variable is of type integer. I have passed this variable as the switch variable. This is allowed. We know that case one is the match and therefore this statement will execute. But after this statement we do not have the break statement. So there is the fall through behavior. Case two will also execute and therefore we will get case two in the output as well. Now this might not be an intentional behavior. So we will get warning from the compiler. This statement may fall through. We will get the output case one and case two. But we will also get this warning. this warning is associated with this specific statement. Here we have the fall through behavior. Now if this behavior is intentional, we can inform the compiler about the same by including this fall through attribute. We have included this fall through attribute just after this statement to tell the compiler that the fall through behavior is intentional. So compiler will not generate warning for this. We will get the output case one and case 2. We are getting this output without any warning from the compiler. I hope this concept is clear to you. One thing to note that after this attribute you need to add the semicolon. Don't miss this semicolon. Also I want to mention that fall through attribute has been introduced in C++ 17. So with this we have understood the fall through behavior and this means we are done with this topic and this lecture. Okay friends this is it for now. Thank you for watching this lecture. I will see you in the next one. [Applause] [Music]"","

In the previous lecture, we have understood the if else statement. Now we are in this lecture and the name of this lecture is switch statement. In this lecture, we will understand our second control structure. So without any further delay, let's get started with this lecture and let's see what are the topics. The first topic of this lecture is introduction to switch statement. First I will introduce you to switch statement. Then we will move to the second topic to understand important points associated with the switch statement. Finally I will explain the fall through behavior of the switch statement as well. So these are the topics. Let's start with the first one that is introduction to switch statement. Now what is switch statement? The switch statement allows us to choose between different options based on the value of a single variable or an expression. So to the switch we can pass a single variable or an expression. Based on the value of the single variable or an expression we would be able to evaluate a specific option of the switch. This can be better understood with the help of the syntax of the switch statement. Here is the syntax. We first need to specify the keyword switch. Within parenthesis, we need to provide a single variable or an expression. Based on the value of the expression or a single variable that we pass here, a specific case will be evaluated. Here we will have the equality comparison. The value of the single variable or an expression is compared with these constants. If it is the case that the value matches with constant one, then the statements of this case will execute. If the value matches with constant two, then the statements of this specific case will execute. If it is the case that the value is not matching with any constant that we specify here, then the default case will execute. This means the statements within default case will execute.

We have already covered different types of operators in C++. Now is the best time to study precedence and associivity of operators. So without any further delay, let's get started with this lecture and let's see what are the topics. The first topic is precedence of operators. First we will understand precedence properly. Then we will move to the second topic to understand associivity of operators. After this we will understand precedence and associivity table where we will see different types of operators we have and their precedence and associivity. So these are all the topics. Let's start with the first one. Precedence of operators. So what is precedence of operators? Precedence of operators helps in deciding which operator will be evaluated first when two or more operators appear in an expression. Let's say we have a complex expression with two or more operators. We call an expression a complex expression when we have two or more operators in that expression. If you have an expression like this, then deciding which operator will be evaluated first is quite important because there is the high chance that a complex expression may yield two or more possible answers. An expression must always yield one possible answer. There cannot be two or more possible answers of an expression. Therefore, understanding which operator should be evaluated first is important and this is decided by precedence of operators. An expression that evaluates to two or more possible answers is called an ambiguous expression. Precedence helps in eliminating the ambiguity of an expression by deciding the operator that needs to be evaluated first. So here is the second point. It helps in evaluating an expression without ambiguity. This means it removes ambiguity from an expression. It gives us just one possible answer from an expression because it helps in deciding which operator will be evaluated first in a complex expression. Now to understand this properly, let's take one simple example. Let's say we have this example 2 + 3 * 4. This expression is a complex expression because it has two operators. Now here deciding the specific operator which will be evaluated first is quite important because this expression can give us two possible answers. If we evaluate the multiplication first then we will get 2 + 12 because 3 * 4 is 12. Now the addition will be performed. We will get 14 as the result. This is the first possible answer. Now if we evaluate the addition first then we will get 5 * 4 because 2 + 3 is 5 and 5 * 4 is 20. So this is the second possible answer. We are getting two possible answers for this expression. An expression must always yield one possible answer. But here we are getting two possible answers. So clearly this expression is an ambiguous expression. It has two possible answers. Now here we need to remove the ambiguity because an expression must always yield one possible answer and ambiguity can be removed with the help of precedence of operators. Now we need to decide which operator must be evaluated first. Now how do we decide which operator should be evaluated first? This can be decided by precedence of these operators. Please understand that multiplication has more precedence than addition. This is already decided. So precedence of multiplication is more than the addition. Therefore, multiplication must be performed first and then the addition. So we have decided the order of evaluation. This is done based on the precedence of these operators. So what do you think? What is the correct answer? The correct answer is 14 not the 20 because multiplication has to be performed first and then the addition. There is no other possible answer. I hope this is clear to you. So we are getting 14 as the result not 20 and therefore there is only one possible answer for this expression. Now the ambiguity is removed from this expression. So we can say that precedence helps in deciding which operator will be evaluated first when two or more operators appear in an expression and it also helps in evaluating an expression without ambiguity. So with this we have understood precedence properly. This means we are done with the first topic. Now let's move to the second topic to understand associivity of operators. Now what is associivity of operators? We have already learned the significance of precedence. We know what precedence does, what role it plays. With the help of precedence, we can decide the order of evaluation of operators. It decides which operator will be evaluated first based on the precedence of operators. But there can be a possibility that an expression can have more than one operators with same precedence. If that's the case, then precedence cannot play its role. Because if the operators have the same precedence then we cannot decide the order of evaluation of the operators. Now here comes the role of associivity. Associivity helps in deciding the direction of evaluation when two or more operators with same precedence appear in an expression. So when we have more than one operators with same precedence then associivity plays its role. It helps in deciding the order of evaluation in an expression. Now let's take an example to understand this. Let's say we have this expression 20 / 5 * 2. Here we need to decide whether the division will be performed first or the multiplication. Now here precedence cannot play its role because division and multiplication have the same precedence. Now here associivity can play its role. Here we need to decide the order of evaluation because this expression gives us two possible answers. If we evaluate multiplication first, we will get 20 / 10 because 5 * 2 is 10. Now 20 / 10 is 2. This is the first possible answer. Now if we evaluate division first, we will get 4 * 2 because 20 / 5 is 4. 4 * 2 is 8. This is the second possible answer. Now we need to decide which answer is the correct answer. As I have mentioned this already, these operators have the same precedence. Therefore, associivity has to play its role. Associivity helps in deciding the direction of evaluation. The direction of evaluation of these operators is left to right. This is already decided. So in the order they appear, we need to evaluate in the same way. We need to evaluate division first then the multiplication. So clearly this answer is incorrect. This one is correct. So now we know that we need to perform division first and then the multiplication. The same order the operators are appearing in an expression. We need to evaluate this expression. I hope this is clear to you. So this is the meaning of associivity. It helps in deciding the order of evaluation especially in those cases when we have more than one operators with same precedence. So with this we have understood the concept of associivity as well. This means we are done with the second topic. Now let's move to the third topic to understand the precedence and associivity table. Now here I'm going to list down the precedence of a different category of operators. I will also list down the operators under each category and I will provide the associivity of each. Also please note that not every operator that we will see in this table is covered before this lecture. There are some operators which we will cover later in this course. Also here I'm not going to list down all the operators that we have in C++. I will only list down the important ones. Now here comes the first category of operators which is scope resolution. Under this category we have just one operator the scope resolution operator. Associivity is left to right and it has the highest precedence among all the operators. Lower the value of the precedence, higher the precedence of the operator. So clearly if the operator has the precedence of one, then that operator has the highest precedence among all the operators in C++. Okay, now let's move to the second category which is postfix like under this category we have these operators. We have the postfix increment and postfix decrement operators. A is some operant I'm assuming. Apart from this we have function cast operator which allows us to do type casting. These brackets are used for arrays and this is the arrow operator we will study later. Associivity of these operators is also left to right. Now here comes the third category unary. Under this category we have these unary operators. We have pre-increment and predment operators. Then we have un plus, unary minus, logical not, bitwise kn. We have the ind direction operator and the address of operator. These operators are used mainly with pointers. Then we have the size of operator which allows us to get the size of some specific data type. And then we have new and delete operators. These operators are used to allocate or deallocate memory for us. These are all unary operators and their associivity is right to left. Their precedence is three. Then comes the fourth category which is pointer to member. Here we have these operators which we have not studied yet. We have member object selector and member pointer selector. These operators have the left to right associivity. Then comes the fifth category which is multiplicative. We are well aware about these operators. These are arithmetic operators. Multiplication, division and mod. These operators have left to right associivity and their precedence is five. Then comes additive category with operators binary plus and binary minus. Associivity is left to right and precedence is six. In this list, we can observe that unary operators have the associivity right to left. The rest of the operators have the associivity left to right. Now here comes the seventh category which is shift with operators left shift and right shift. These operators have left to right associivity. Their precedence is seven. The eighth category is relational with operators less than, greater than, less than, equal to, greater than, equal to. Associivity is left to right. Then we have equality category with operators equal to and not equal to. Associivity is left to right and precedence is nine. The 10th category is bitwise and with bitwise and operator as the only operator and the associivity of this operator is left to right. We can observe the precedence is 10. Then we have bitwise exor and bitwise or operators. We can see from this table that these operators do not have the same precedence. They have different precedences. The precedence of bitwise and is more than the precedence of bitwise exor. And the precedence of bitwise exor is more than the precedence of bitwise or. These operators have associivity left to right. Then we have logical and and logical or operators. Again logical and has more precedence than logical or but. But associivity is same. Associivity is left to right. Now here comes the conditional operator with associivity right to left. Then after this we have the category assignment with all assignment operators. Their associivity is right to left. After this we have the comma operator with least precedence among all the operators. This is the comma operator with associivity left to right. Some of the operators we have not studied yet. We will study those operators later in this course. From this table it is clear what is the precedence of the operators and what are their associivity. So with this we are done with the precedence and associivity table and this means we are done with all the topics of this lecture. Okay friends, this is it for now. Thank you for watching this lecture. I will see you in the next one. [Applause] [Music]"""

In this presentation, we will understand the scope resolution operator. So without any further delay, let's get started with this lecture and let's see what are the topics. The first topic of this lecture is the scope resolution operator. First we will properly understand the scope resolution operator. Then we will move to the next topic where we will understand some use cases associated with the scope resolution operator. So these are the topics. Let's start with the first one that is the scope resolution operator. So what is the scope resolution operator? Scope resolution operator is the operator that allows us to access something outside the current scope. In order to understand this definition properly, first we need to understand the meaning of a scope. Now what is a scope? A scope is a region or area where we can define some entity. We can define a variable, function or some other entity in a scope and that specific entity is visible or accessible within that scope only. Now let's say we want to access that specific entity outside the scope where it is defined then we can use the scope resolution operator for this purpose. Normally we cannot access a specific entity which is defined in a scope outside that scope but with the help of the scope resolution operator we can access that entity outside its scope as well. So that's what this definition is saying. The scope resolution operator is the operator that allows us to access some entity outside the current scope where it is defined. I hope this is clear to you. Now this is how we can represent a scope resolution operator. It is represented by two colons and it also helps resolve which scope a name belongs to. That's why this operator is called the scope resolution operator. It helps resolving which scope a name belongs to. That is it tells the compiler where to look for to access a specific entity. So that's the scope resolution operator. Now let's see the syntax of the scope resolution operator. We first need to specify the name of the scope and then we specify the scope resolution operator and then the name of the entity which we want to access. Now to understand the syntax properly, let's imagine an example. Let's say we have defined a nameace. Now within that nameace, we have defined a function as well. In the last lecture, we already learned how to define a namespace and how to define some entity within a name space. Now, when we define an entity within a namespace, then that entity will have the scope of the name space where it is defined. Here we are imagining that some name space is defined and within that name space some entity let's say a function is defined. So that function is accessible within the name space only. Now if we want to access that function outside the name space then we need to use the scope resolution operator. Before the scope resolution operator we need to specify the name of the scope where the entity is available. This means we need to provide the name of the name space first. Then after this we need to provide the scope resolution operator. And after the scope resolution operator we need to provide the name of the entity which we want to access from a specific name space. I hope this is clear to you. So in this way we would be able to access a specific entity which belongs to a specific scope. And this is how the scope resolution operator works. So with this we have understood the first topic that is the scope resolution operator properly. Now let's move to the second topic to understand some use cases associated with the scope resolution operator. Here comes the first use case. Accessing global variables. If a local variable hides a global one, use scope resolution operator to access the global variable. So if there is some local variable which we have defined within an entity and there is some global variable which is defined in the program which is defined outside of any entity with the same name as the local variable. then the local variable will hide the global variable and therefore we would not be able to access the global variable within the entity where the local variable is defined. But if we want to access the global variable then we need to use the scope resolution operator. Now this can be better understood with the help of an example. Here I have included the IO stream header file because I'm using stdc out here. And here I have defined variable x of type integer with value 10. This is the global variable x because this variable is defined in the program and it is outside of any function or any other entity. This variable is accessible to all the entities we defined in this program. So this variable is also accessible within this main function. So that's why we call this variable a global variable. It is not defined within a function or an entity. It is defined in the program itself. Now here is the main function. Within this main function, I have defined this variable x of type integer with value five. This is the local variable. Now, why am I calling this a local variable? This is because this variable is defined within the main function. This variable has the scope of the main function and therefore this variable is accessible within this main function only. Whenever we define a variable within a function that variable is called a local variable. So this variable is local to this function. It has the scope of this function. Now you can observe that the name of the global variable and the name of the local variable is same. So now the question arises that if we try to access x in our main function then which variable will be accessed will it be a global variable or a local variable? Here in this std see out statement I am trying to access the value of x. I have specified X here. Now my question is will this value will be accessed or this value will be accessed. There is a clash between these two variables. These variables have the same name. Which variable will be accessed? Will it be a global variable or a local variable? The answer to this question is the local variable will be accessed because the local variable takes priority over the global variable. It is always the case. Whenever there is such clash always the local variable wins. Here I have specified the name X. So clearly we will get value five here because the local variable wins over the global variable. So now we know the value of the local variable X will be displayed by this std seeout statement. I hope this is clear to you. Now let's say we want to access this global variable X. Then how do we access this variable? We know that this local variable is hiding this global variable. Whenever we specify X, the local variable wins over the global variable. Now the question is how do we access this global variable? We can access this global variable with the help of the scope resolution operator. Here I have done this job. Here we have this stdcout statement and here I have specified the scope resolution operator along with the variable x. Here I'm trying to access the global variable X. From here also it is clear that if a local variable hides a global one, use scope resolution operator to access the global variable. Here I'm using the scope resolution operator to access this global variable. Here we know we get value 10. So we will get the expected outcome from this program. we'll get this output local x5 then global x10 first we are getting the value of the local variable that's what we can see and then we are getting the value of the global variable so that's the concept of the scope resolution operator it allows us to access the global variable if it is hidden by the local variable now let's say if we do not have the local variable x Then if we specify x we will get the access of the global variable because there is no such local variable available in the function. But if we have the local variable which is hiding the global variable then we need to use the scope resolution operator to access the global variable. I hope this idea is clear to you. So we are done with the first use case. Now let's move to the second use case. The second use case is accessing name spaces. When using names from a name space, use scope resolution operator to access the name. As I have mentioned this already, if some name or an entity is defined within a name space and if we want to access that entity outside the name space then we need to use the scope resolution operator. Here is the example to demonstrate the same. I have included the IO stream header file inside this main function with the help of stdc out. I'm trying to display hello nesso on the screen. Now here you can observe that std is the name of the name space where see out object is available. To access this object outside the std name space that is within this main function we need to use the scope resolution operator like this. So it is following the syntax which we have already seen. Here we are accessing see out in the std name space through the scope resolution operator. See out object is available in the std name space. We are trying to access it. I hope this is clear to you. So we have been using stdc out without realizing that we have the scope resolution operator between the two and this operator is helping us to access this object available in the std name space. We know the syntax is correct. We will get the correct output. We will get hello nesso as the output. So with this we have understood the second use case as well. This means we are done with all the use cases of scope resolution operator and this means we are done with the second topic as well. Okay friends, this is it for now. Thank you for watching this lecture. I will see you in the next one. [Applause] [Music]"""

Let's find this out. Initialization happens when a variable is declared and given a value at the same time. So when we declare a variable and if you provide it a value at the time of declaration only, we call this process initialization. For example, here variable A is declared and it is initialized with value 10. I'm saying this variable is initialized with value 10 because this value is provided at the time of declaration only. So this is initialization. As simple as that. What about assignment? Assignment means changing the value of an already declared variable. So if we already have a variable and if we change its value later in the code then we call this assignment. For example, here variable A is initialized to 10. Now if you write a equal to 20 then this is assignment because this new value 20 is provided to this variable a after its declaration. So this is assignment. Now here is the takeaway. Initialization is same as providing the value to the variable for the first time that two at the time of declaration and assignment means changing the value of the variable later in the code that after declaration. So that's the difference between initialization and assignment. Want to learn C++ properly? Follow our C++ programming course."""

In the previous lectures, we have covered different types of operators. We have understood arithmetic operators, conditional operator, comma operator, increment, decrement operators. Apart from this, we have also understood relational operators, logical operators, bitwise operators, assignment operators. There are many different types of operators we have already covered. Now we are in this lecture and the name of this lecture is introduction to name spaces. In this lecture we will understand the concept of namespaces which is important for us to understand because in the next lecture we will cover an important operator in C++ which requires the knowledge of name spaces. That's why this lecture. So without any further delay, let's get started with this lecture and let's see what are the topics. The first topic of this lecture is the naming conflict. First we will understand the concept of the naming conflict and we will understand where it occurs and when it occurs. Then we will move to the second topic to understand the concept of the name space. After this we will understand the std name space which is quite common to use in C++ programs. So these are the topics we will cover in this lecture. Let's start with the first one which is the naming conflict. So what is the concept of the naming conflict? In order to understand this concept, let's consider a situation. Let's say we are writing a project and within that project we have defined two files A. CPP and B.CP. These files are part of the same project. Now let's say the code within the A. CPP looks like this. We have added this code. We have included the IO stream header file and we have also defined the print function. Within this print function, we have written this std see out statement with this message that we want to display on the screen that is this is from file a. We know that when we call this print function then this message will be displayed on the screen. So this is the code of a cpp file. In the same way we have written the code for b do. CPP file as well. This is the code of the B.CP file. IO stream header file is included and the print function is also defined. Within this print function, stdd out statement is written with this message. This is from file B. When we call this function, this message will be displayed on the screen. Now we know that we have defined these two files and they are part of the same project. If we compile these two files separately then they will be compiled successfully. There will be no problem at all. But the problem occurs when linker comes into the picture. Linker is the software program which has the job of combining the object files obtained from the compiler into a single executable file. Linker will combine the object files of these files and then it won't be able to do so. It will produce the linker error. Why it is the case? why it would not be able to combine the object files of these two files. This is exactly what we now need to understand. We now need to figure out why are we getting this linker error. We know the job of linker is to combine the object files of the files within the same project. These files are part of the same project. we will get the equivalent object files because compilation is successful. Now when linker tries to combine the object files then it would not be able to do so because in these two files we have functions with same name. Here we have what is called the naming conflict. We have same names and therefore they conflict with each other. That's why we are getting naming conflict here. Due to naming conflict, linker would not be able to produce an executable file from the object files of these two files because in the same file we cannot have two functions with same name. That's the problem. So we will get the linker error because of the naming conflict. We are getting the linker error and therefore it is important to resolve this issue and this issue can be resolved with the help of a name space. This is exactly what we will understand in the next topic. For now I hope it is clear to you what is the meaning of the naming conflict and when it occurs. So with this we are done with the first topic that is the naming conflict. Now let's move to the second topic to understand the concept of the name space. As I have already mentioned this to resolve a naming conflict we use name spaces. But what exactly a namespace is that is what we need to understand. A namespace is a container that allows grouping identifiers such as variables, functions, classes, etc. under a unique name to avoid naming conflicts. So, think of a name space as a container that allows us to group different identifiers such as variables, functions, classes, and other entities. And the best part is that we can give that container a unique name and the container is the only thing that the linker will see. Therefore, there will be no naming conflicts because the container name is unique. If we define multiple name spaces, then the names of those name spaces are unique. Therefore, there will be no naming conflict. So with the help of a name space we can avoid naming conflicts. To understand this even better let's consider the A.CP file and B.CP file. We will modify those files and this time we will include name spaces. Here is the A.CP file. This is the modified file. Here we can observe that I have defined this name space with the name file A. Please observe the syntax here. We first need to specify the keyword nameace. Then we need to provide the name of the nameace which I have provided as file A. And within parenthesis I have included this function definition. This is the print function. In the same way I have modified B.CP as well. Here I have defined this nameace file B and within this name space I have added this code of the print function. Now linker will observe only these name spaces not the functions within them. And we can observe these namespaces are unique. Therefore there is no naming conflict. I hope this is clear to you. This means linker would be able to combine the equivalent object files and is capable of producing an executable file from them. Therefore, there will be no problem at all. Now let's say we want to call these functions which are available within these name spaces. For this purpose, first we need to specify the name of the name space. Then we can provide the name of these functions. Let's define a new file with the name main.cpp. And within this file, let's define our main function. Here is the main function. And this is the name of the file main. CPP. In this main function, I'm calling the print functions of these two name spaces. Here you can observe the syntax. First I have specified the name of the name space then the two columns and then the function which I want to call. I want to call the print function which is available within file a name space. This is the name space and the print function is part of this nameace. Therefore I can call this and in the same way I have called the print function which is available in the nameace file B. This is what we can observe. These functions will be called successfully and we will get the output. This is from file A. This is from file B. We are getting this message from this print function and we are getting this message from this print function. I hope this is completely clear to you and you can observe there is no naming conflict at all. Although the name of these functions are same but their name spaces are different. So there is no naming conflict. So in this way we can avoid naming conflicts with the help of named spaces. And with this we have understood the concept of name space as well. This means we are done with the second topic also. Now let's move to the third topic to understand the stdd nameace which is quite popular and widely used in C++ programs. The std nameace stands for standard namespace. The full form of std is standard. That's why std namespace stands for standard namespace. It is the name space which is already defined for us and it contains standard library tools like see out, see in string and many other tools. These tools are part of std name space. We are well familiar with see out and see in. These are part of std namespace. There are other library tools as well which are part of std namespace. So when we want to use these tools, we know that we need to specify the std name space first. Now let's take an example to properly understand this. Here I have included the IO stream header file and within this main function I have defined variable val with value 10. Here is the std out statement which allows us to print the value of this variable which is 10. Here we can observe that see out is the object which is available in the std name space. We have been using std see out in this course from the very beginning but we haven't realized this that std is the name of the nameace. So this is the name space or the container which is holding see out object. So if you want to use see out we need to specify std. That's why we were specifying std colout from the very beginning. Now when we execute this program we will get 10 on the screen. I hope this is clear to you. So this is the std nameace and this is how we can use a specific tool from the std nameace. Now I would like to mention that this is not the only way to use a specific tool from the std name space. If we want, we can eliminate or avoid writing std colon colon before a specific object which is part of std name space. This can be done when we specify this line at the top using namespace std. With this line we are telling the compiler that in this program we are using this specific name space called std. Now there is no need to specify std colon colon before this seeout object. We can directly use this seeout object. That is what I have mentioned here. There is no need to apply std colon before seeout object. Now when we execute this program we will get the same output 10. There is no need to specify std colon because we are already telling the compiler that we are using the std name space. Also I want to mention this that following this practice is highly discouraged among C++ developers. The reason is quite simple. Here when we type out std colon before an object we properly specify that that object is part of std. So we are explicitly mentioning this and it is always good to explicitly mention which object is part of which name space. That's why it is recommended to mention std colon colon before the object which is contained within it. Also if let's say we try to define a specific identifier within our project and that too with the name which is already available in std then this will cause naming conflict. If let's say we try to define a function with the same name see out then there will be a naming conflict. Compiler will get confused. this will cause problems and therefore this practice is highly discouraged. I hope this is clear to you. So with this we have understood the std name space also. This means we have covered this topic properly and we are done with this lecture. Okay friends, this is it for now. Thank you for watching this lecture. I will see you in the next one.

Now it depends on the name parameter whether the value of the name will be returned or guest will be returned. Let's say get username function is called with the value John then John will be returned because this is the first true value. If you pass an empty string then it will be treated as false and therefore guest will be returned from this function. So we will get the output John and guest. When we pass empty string to this function we will get the default value which is guest. So we can say with the help of logical or operator we can set a default value.

In the previous lectures, we have understood bitwise operators in C++. We have successfully covered all the bitwise operators in C++. Now we are in this lecture and the name of this lecture is assignment operators. In this lecture we will understand assignment operators available in C++. So without any further delay, let's get started with this lecture and let's see what are the topics. The first topic of this lecture is assignment operators. First we will understand what are assignment operators and what are the different types of assignment operators we have. Then we will move to the second topic where we will understand some important points associated with assignment operators. So these are the topics. Let's start with the first one. Assignment operators. So what are assignment operators? Assignment operators are those operators that are used to assign value in the RHS to the variable in the LHS. So with the help of an assignment operator we can assign value which is available in the right hand side of the assignment operator to the variable in the left hand side of the assignment operator. We already know about simple assignment operator which is represented by single equals sign. We know that with the help of that operator we can assign value which is available in the right hand side to the variable in the left hand side. But the simple assignment operator is not the only assignment operator we have in C++. We have more assignment operators and we call them compound assignment operators because they are formed from two operators not one. We have the assignment operator and one more operator which is either an arithmetic operator or a bitwise operator. Let's see what those operators are one by one. In this table, I will list down all the assignment operators. I will provide examples associated with those operators and I will also mention what they are equivalent to. Now, here comes the first assignment operator which is the simple assignment operator. Example is A gets B. This is how you can read it. A gets B. This is because variable A will get the value B and this expression is equivalent to A gets B. So there is no difference. Now here comes the second assignment operator which is plus equals. Example is a += b. This is how you can read it. A += b. And this expression is same as a gets a + b. I hope this is clear to you. So here I have combined the addition operator with the assignment operator. This is the compound assignment operator I was talking about. We do not have just this assignment operator. We have other assignment operators as well. We call them compound assignment operators. The third assignment operator is minus equals. Example is a minus equals b and this is equivalent to a gets a minus b. The fourth one is time equals example is a * b and this is equivalent to a gets a * b. The fifth operator in this list is divides equals. Example is a divides equals b and this is equivalent to a gets a divided by b. The sixth operator in this list is mod equals. Example is a mod equals b and this is equivalent to a gets a mod b. I hope these compound assignment operators are clear to you. They are formed from an arithmetic operator and the assignment operator which is the simple assignment operator. Now here comes the seventh assignment operator which is the bitwise and equals. Example is a bitwise and equals b and this is equivalent to a gets a bitwise and b. Now here comes the eth operator which is the bitwise or equals. Example is a bitwise or equals b and this is equivalent to a gets a bit wise or b. The ninth operator is bitwise xor equals example is a bitwise xor equals b and this is equivalent to a gets a bitwise exor b. The 10th operator in this list is bitwise left shift equals example is a bitwise left shift equals b and this is equivalent to a gets a bitwise left shift b. The last operator, the 11th operator in this list is bitwise right shift equals. Example is a bitwise right shift equals b and this is equivalent to a gets a bitwise right shift b. So these are all the assignment operators we have in C++. Here we can observe that these compound assignment operators are formed from bitwise operator and the simple assignment operator. So we have understood assignment operators. This means we are done with the first topic. Now let's move to the second topic to understand some important points associated with assignment operators. Here is the first point. All assignment operators return the assigned value. No matter what assignment operator we consider, they not only assign value in the right hand side to the variable in the left hand side, they also return the assigned value. Now let's take an example to understand this properly. Here we have this std out statement. We have this expression. This value will be assigned to variable X because this is the simple assignment operator. Not only this, we will get 10 from this expression as the result. So clearly this assignment operator is not only assigning the value in the right hand side to the left hand side variable, it is also returning this value as the result. So we know that std see out will display value 10 on the screen. And I hope it is also clear to you why am I calling this an expression? because it is returning some value. We can see the value is 10. Now here is the second point. Evaluation order is right to left. Assignment operators are always evaluated right to left. If you have multiple assignment operators in an expression, then those will be evaluated from right to left. Now let's take an example. Here we have this stdc out statement and this expression. In this expression we have two assignment operators. These operators will be evaluated from right to left not left to right. So first this expression will be evaluated value 10 will be assigned to variable y and this value will also be returned and this means we will get x gets 10. 10 will be assigned to x and after this 10 will be returned. So clearly with the help of stdc out we will see the output 10 on the screen. So with this I hope these points are completely clear to you. With this we are done with the second topic also and we are done with this lecture. Okay friends this is it for now. Thank you for watching this lecture. I will see you in the next one.

In the previous lectures, we understood bitwise and or not and exor operators. Now we are in this lecture and the name of this lecture is bitwise shift operators. So without any further delay, let's get started with this lecture and let's see what are the topics. The first topic of this lecture is introduction to bitwise shift operators. First we will understand bitwise shift operators. We will understand what they are and what are the different types of bitwise shift operators we have. Then we will move to the second topic where we will understand bitwise left shift operator. After understanding bitwise left shift operator we will understand bitwise right shift operator. So these are the topics. Let's start with the first one. Introduction to bitwise shift operators. So what are bitwise shift operators? Bitwise shift operators are those operators that allow us to move the bits of a specific binary number left or right. As the name itself suggests, bitwise shift operator is an operator that allows us to move the bits of a specific binary number or shift the bits of a specific binary number either left or right. There are two types of bitwise shift operators. We have bitwise left shift operator which is represented by two less than symbols and we have bitwise right shift operator which is represented by two greater than symbols. So these are the types of bitwise shift operators we have in C++. We will discuss these two types properly in this lecture. For now we are done with the introduction to bitwise shift operators. This means we are done with the first topic. Let's move to the second topic to understand bitwise left shift operator. So what is the bitwise left shift operator? Bitwise left shift operator is the operator that allows us to move the bits of a binary number to the left by n positions. As the name suggests, it allows us to shift the bits of a specific binary number towards left and that too by n positions. Here is the syntax of the bitwise left shift operator. First we need to specify the number and then we need to provide the bitwise left shift operator and then the value of n where n represents the number of positions we want to shift the bits of a specific number. So this is the syntax. Now let's consider a C++ program to understand how to use bitwise left shift operator in C++ programs. Here is the program. I have included the IO stream header file because I'm using stdc out here. Inside this main function, I have defined variable A with value five. This is an integer variable. And also I have defined another integer variable. The name of this variable is result and to this variable I'm trying to assign the result of this expression. Here we have a less than less than one. Bitwise left shift operator is applied on a. A has the value five. So bitwise left shift operation will be performed on five and all the bits will be shifted towards left by one position. we will get some value and this value will be stored in this variable and then we can print this result on the screen with the help of stdc out. Now what do you think what is the output of this program will be this can be understood by first converting this value to its equivalent binary value and we need to perform bitwise left shift on that binary value. So let's do this. Let's first write the equivalent binary representation of this value. We know this is the binary equivalent of value 5 0 1 0 1. Now let's perform bitwise left shift by one position on this binary number. As we need to perform bitwise left shift by one position. All the bits will be shifted towards left by one position. This means this bit will be shifted towards left to the second position from the right. So this will get the second position from the right. This bit will get the third position from the right. This bit will get the fourth position and this bit will get the fifth position. But we do not have to specify this bit over here as this does not contribute anything to the final output. Here we have 1 0 1. Now we have the vacant position. This can be filled with zero. This is always the case. We need to fill the veant position by zero. When we perform bitwise left shift operation on a binary number here now we have 1 0 1 0. This is same as 10 in decimal. I hope this is clear to you. So now we know when we execute this program we will get the output as 10. Here you can observe that if we multiply 5 by 2 then we will get 10 as the result. So it seems like a left shift 1 is same as multiplication of a or multiplication of five by two power 1. Here this one represents the number of positions we specify here. Here we have one. Therefore we have two power 1. So multiplication of the value of a will be performed by two power 1. So we can conclude that bitwise left shift operator allows us to multiply a specific number by powers of two. Now to justify this point even better, let's consider a different example. This time let's say we have two in place of one. Now we need to perform bitwise left shift on this binary number by two positions or what we can do? We can perform bitwise left shift operation by one position on this binary number. We have already performed bitwise left shift operation on this binary number by one position. Now we just need to perform bitwise left shift operation on this binary number by one position. This is same as performing bitwise left shift on this binary number by two positions. Let's do this. Now we know that this bit will be placed over here in the second position from the right. This bit will be placed in the third position. This bit will be placed in the fourth position and this bit will be placed in the fifth position. Now I have specified this bit because this is one and this will contribute to the final output. This means this bit plays an important role in the final result. Now here we have a vacant position. This must be filled by zero. We already learned this. Now we have this binary number and this is same as value 20 in decimal. You can verify this on your own. So now we know what's the output of this program. We will get 20 as the output. I hope this is clear to you. Now we can observe that if we multiply 5 by 4, we will get 20 as the result. So it seems like a left shift 2 is same as multiplication of a by 2^ 2 that is multiplication of the value 5 by 2^ 2 which is same as 4. So here we have 5 * 4 which is 20 that is why we are getting output as 20. So this point is completely justified. Bitwise left shift operator allows us to multiply a number by powers of two. So with this we have understood bitwise left shift operator. This means we are done with the second topic also. Now let's move to the third topic to understand bitwise right shift operator. Bitwise right shift operator allows us to move the bits of a specific number to the right by n positions. This can be understood from the name itself. All the bits of a binary number will be shifted towards right by n positions and as the result it divides the number by powers of two. This is different from bitwise left shift operator. We know in case of bitwise left shift operator the number gets multiplied by powers of two. Here the number gets divided by powers of two. Now here comes the third important point. Weakened positions on the left are filled with zeros for positive integers. In case of positive integers, all the veened positions on the left are filled with zeros. It is quite obvious that if we shift the bits towards right, then we will have some veened positions on the left. Those weakened positions will be filled with zeros. This is true for positive integers. Now let's consider the syntax of the bitwise right shift operator. Here is the syntax. We have number then the bitwise right shift operator and then the value for n which represents the number of positions. Now here is a simple example program to demonstrate the use of bitwise right shift operator. Here I have defined variable A with value 10. And here I'm performing bitwise right shift operation on this value by one position. We know we will get some value here which will get stored in this variable result and eventually this will get printed on the screen. Now what do you think? What is the output of this program? Here we first need to convert this value to its equivalent binary form. This is the equivalent binary number of this number. We have 1 0 1 0. Here we need to shift this bit towards right by one position. We know that this bit will be discarded because there is nothing like zeroth position. Bits must start from the first position. So this bit will be discarded. Now we need to move to the second bit from the right. We have one over here. This bit will be shifted towards right by one position. So clearly it will get placed over here in the first position. This bit will be placed in the second position from the right. This bit in the third position. Now what about this vacant position? As we know this vacant positions on the left are filled with zeros. Therefore this place must be filled by zero. This is true for positive integers. Here we have this positive integer. Now we have this binary number 0 1 0 1 which is same as 5 in decimal. So we know the output of this program is five. I hope this is completely clear to you. Now you can also observe that if we divide this value by two we will get five as the result. So clearly we can say that a right shift 1 is same as division of a by two power 1 or we can say division of 10 in this example by two power 1 where 1 is representing the number of positions. I hope this is clear to you. So we know how to get the output for bitwise right shift operation. Now we know how all this works. But you might be wondering what happens in case of negative integers. We know that vacant positions on the left must be filled with zeros for positive integers. What about negative integers? For negative integers the behavior is implementation defined. This is what I have written here. Implementation defined behavior for negative integers. We do not know whether the vacant positions on the left are filled with zeros or they are filled with ones. This is implementation defined behavior. This means compiler and the system will decide what these bits must be. I hope this is clear to you. So we do not know that waken positions will be filled with zeros or ones in case of negative integers. But one thing is clear that the number will always be divided by powers of two when we consider the bitwise right shift operator.

Let's find this out. Narrowing conversion refers to the conversion of larger or more precise type to smaller or less precise type. So it is called narrowing conversion because larger type is narrowed down to smaller type. Now let's take a simple example. Here I've defined this variable D of type integer and I'm trying to initialize this variable with a floating point value 3.14. We know floatingoint value is larger or more precise compared to integer value which is smaller or less precise. Here I'm trying to store this value in this variable which is of type integer. Clearly narrowing conversion happens in this case to store this value. So here this value will be converted to integer. We will get value three in this variable D. Now if you try to print the value of this variable D, we will get three as the result.4 and 14 is truncated or deleted. This means data is lost. So narrowing conversion leads to data loss. Now what happens if we replace int by double? There is no narrowing conversion in this case because the type of this variable is matching with the type of this value. So when we try to display this value, we will get 3.14. This means there is no data loss because there is no narrowing conversion. So this is the concept of narrowing conversion in C++.

In the previous lecture, we understood some of the bitwise operators in C++. Precisely, we have understood bitwise and operator and bitwise or operator. Now we are in this lecture and the name of this lecture is bitwise operators part two. In this lecture, we will understand the remaining bitwise operators we have in C++. So without any further delay, let's get started with this lecture and let's see what are the operators we will study in this lecture. We will study bitwise exor operator and bitwise not operator in this lecture. Let's start with bitwise exor operator. Bitwise exor operator is represented by the carrot symbol and it is used to compare each bit of the two operants. So with the help of bitwise exor operator we can compare each bit of the two operants. It is same as the bitwise and operator and bitwise or operator. Just like bitwise and and bitwise or operator. We would be able to compare each bit of the two operants with the help of bitwise exor operator as well. But it returns one when bits are different otherwise it returns zero. So it gives us the value one when bits are different otherwise it gives zero. This can be understood from the truth table of the bitwise exor operator as well. Here is the truth table. Here we can observe that when bits are different then we will get one as the result of bitwise exor otherwise we will get zero. Now where do we use the bitwise exor operator? That's the question. What is its use case? We use it to flip specific bits of a number. If we want to flip specific bits of a number then we use bitwise exor operator. This can be understood from the example more properly. Let's say we have this binary number 10 01 which is same as 9 in decimal. Now let us assume that we want to flip these two bits that is middle two bits that is we want to change these bits to one. For this purpose, we can use bitwise exor operator. We need to consider the second operent as well. Here in order to flip these bits, we need to set the corresponding bits in the second operent to one. So we will get the second operent as 0 1 1 0 which is same as 6 in decimal. Now we can perform bitwise exor on these binary numbers. We will get 1 one one one as the result. You can observe that the bits are flipped and the remaining bits are obtained as it is. This binary number is same as value 15 in decimal. So clearly bitwise exor of 9 and six is 15. Now how are we getting this result? This can be understood from the truth table. When in the second operent we have a specific bit as one, then the corresponding bit in the first operent gets flipped. 0 becomes one and one becomes zero. This is what we can observe from the truth table. Also when a specific bit is set to zero in the second operint then the corresponding bit in the first operint will be obtained as it is. When we have zero in the first operent we will get zero in the result. When we have one in the first operint we will get one in the result. Now let's get back to the example. Here we have 1 0 0 1 and we want to flip these two bits only. For this purpose, we need to set the corresponding bits to one in the second operint. This is exactly what we have done. And we want to obtain these bits as it is. That's why the corresponding bits in the second operint have been set to zero. And that's why we are getting this result. I hope this is completely clear to you. So we have understood what bitwise exor operator is and how it works. Now let's write the example program for this specific example. Here is the example program. Here I have included the IO stream header file and inside this main function I have defined variables A and B with values 9 and six. And here I'm performing bitwise exor on 9 and six. We know bitwise exor of 9 and six will give us 15. So with the help of stdc out we would be able to display 15 on the screen. So this is the output. So with this we have understood bitwise exor operator and we know it is useful to flip specific bits of a number. We can flip specific bits of a number with the help of bitwise exor operator. But what if we want to flip all the bits of the number? That too without using the second operent. We can do this with the help of bitwise not operator. This is the operator we will study next. We are done with bitwise exor operator. Now let's move to the second topic where we will discuss bitwise not operator. Bitwise not operator is represented by the tilda symbol and it works on just one operint. This means this is the unary operator. Whatever the bitwise operators we have studied so far were binary operators. But this is the only bitwise operator which is the unary operator. It operates on just one operint and it inverts all the bits of the operint. This means zero becomes one and one becomes zero. This can be understood from the truth table of the bitwise not operator. When a is zero then not a is one. When a is one then not a is zero. As simple as that. Now let's take an example to properly understand the behavior of bitwise not operator. Here is the example. Let's say we have this binary number 0 1 0 0 1. We know this binary number is equivalent to 9 in decimal. We also know this that we can easily represent this number with just four bits. But here I have provided five bits. Now why is that the case? I have provided fifth bit as well because I want to represent the sign of this number two. This bit over here represents the sign bit. It is zero. This means this number is positive. If we have one here, then this means that the number this binary number is representing is negative. I hope this is clear to you. Now let's say we want to perform bitwise not on this number. This means let's say we want to flip all these bits. We can do this easily with the help of bitwise not operator. we will get 1 0 1 1 0 as the result. Here we have the sign bit as one. This means the number that we will get will be the negative number. But what is that number? We can easily find that number by considering the positional weights of these ones. Here we must understand this that the sign bit has the negative positional weight. So the positional weight of this bit is -16. Positional weight of this bit is four and positional weight of this bit is 2. Now we need to add these positional weights. We will get minus 10 as the result. So clearly this binary number is representing a negative integer or a negative number. I hope this is clear to you. So with the help of bitwise not operator we can flip all the bits of a specific operant without needing a second operant. So it is different from bitwise exor operator in the sense that bitwise exor operator has the capability to flip specific bits of a number. So now we know what is bitwise not operator. We use it to flip the bits. But what is the use case of flipping the bits of the binary number? We use bitwise not operator to find complement of a number. So it is used to calculate two's complement of a number. Now what do I mean by this? What is the meaning of two's complement of a number? Two's complement representation is the most common representation in modern computers to represent a negative number. So we use two's complement representation to represent the negative version of a specific number. In order to find two's complement, we need to follow two steps. Step number one is to find the on's complement of a number. Now on's complement of the number is same as flipping the bits of that number. This is the exact thing we are doing here with the help of bitwise not operator. Isn't that so? Here you can observe that with the help of bitwise not operator we have flipped the bits of the binary number. This means we have found out the on's complement of this number. After finding one's complement, step number two is to add one to the result that is the on's complement result. So we just need to add one to this on's complement result to obtain the negative version of this number. So here we add one to this binary number. We will get 1 0 1 1 as the result. This binary number is same as -9 in decimal. Here you can observe that we have obtained the negative version of this number. I hope this is clear to you. So this is the two's complement representation of this number. So to calculate two's complement, we need to calculate one's complement. And finding one's complement is same as flipping the bits of a number. And this is exactly what we are doing with the help of bitwise not operator. So this is the use case of the bitwise not operator. I hope this is completely clear to you. You can also observe that if we add one directly to minus 10 then also we will obtain minus 9. So it makes sense to add one here. Now let's implement this example. Here I have provided nine to this variable A and here I'm performing bitwise not on this variable. This means I'm performing bitwise not on this value. We know that we will obtain minus 10 from here and I'm adding one to it. So we will get -9. So clearly I'm performing two's complement. Here we will get the result as -9. So with this we have understood what is bitwise not operator and where it is used. With this we are done with the second topic also and this means we are done with this lecture. Okay friends this is it for now. Thank you for watching this lecture. I will see you in the next one.

In the previous lecture, we understood logical operators in C++. Now we are in this lecture and the name of this lecture is bitwise operators part one. In this lecture we will understand some of the bitwise operators we have in C++. So without any further delay let's get started with this lecture and let's see what are the topics. The first topic of this lecture is bitwise and operator. And the second topic is bitwise or operator. These are the two operators we will study in this lecture. Let's start with the first operator which is the bitwise and operator. So what is the bitwise and operator? Bitwise and operator is the operator that allows us to compare each bit of the two operants. It is represented by the single amperand symbol and we can use it to compare the bits of the operants. It cannot be used directly to compare the operants. It can be used to compare the bits of the operants. That is why it is called a bitwise operator. It returns one if both the bits are one otherwise it returns zero. So it is quite similar to logical and operator. But we know logical and operator is applied on the operants and it works on the operants themselves. But a bitwise operator works on the bits of the operants. Here we can observe that bitwise and operator returns one when both the bits are one otherwise it gives us zero. This can be understood from the truth table of the bitwise and operator as well. This is the truth table. I am assuming that a and b are single bit operents and bitwise and operator is applied on these two operants. Now let's say that a is zero and b is zero. then bitwise and of a and b will give us zero. This is because when both the bits are one then only we will get one as the result. Here we have both the bits set to zero. That's why we are getting zero. Similarly when a is 0 and b is 1 we will get zero. When a is 1, b is zero we will get zero. But when a is one and b is one then we will get result of bitwise and as one. So from this truth table we can conclude that when both the bits are one we will get the result of bitwise and as one otherwise we will get zero. Now what is the use case of the bitwise and operator? We can use bitwise add operator to extract specific bits from a number. If we want to extract specific bits from a number, we can use the bitwise and operator. This can be understood from this simple example. Let us assume we have this binary number 10 01 which is same as 9 in decimal. Now let's say we want to extract the first two bits of this binary number. For this purpose, we can set the corresponding bits in the second operent to 1. So we will get the second operent as 1 1 0 0 which is same as 12 in decimal. Now we can perform bitwise and of these two binary numbers. We will obtain 1 0 0 0 as the result. This means we have successfully extracted the first two bits from this binary number and this binary number is same as value 8 in decimal. So clearly from this we can observe that bitwise and of 9 and 12 is 8. But why this happens? Why are we getting this result? This can be understood from this truth table. Please observe this truth table. When in the second operint we have a specific bit set to one, then we can observe that we would be able to obtain the corresponding bit from the first operint as it is. This is what we can observe from the truth table. But when we set a specific bit in the second operint as zero then we will get zero as the result. So that's why we have set these two bits to one because we want to extract these two bits and we do not want these bits. That's why we have set 0 0. So this is the reason why we are getting the result as 1 0 0 0 and we would be able to extract the bits as well which we wanted. So in this way we can use the bitwise and operator. I hope this idea is clear to you. Now let's implement this example through a C++ program. Here I have included the IO stream header file and in this main function I have defined these variables A and B and I have initialized them with values 9 and 12 respectively. These are integer variables. After this I have performed the bitwise and operation on A and B. We know bitwise and of 9 and 12 is 8. So clearly with the help of stdc out we will get the result as 8. This is the output we are getting from this program. I hope this is completely clear to you. So with this we have understood the bitwise and operator. This means we are done with the first topic. Now let's move to the second topic to understand bitwise or operator. So what is the bitwise or operator? Bitwise or operator is represented by the single pipe symbol and it can be used to compare each bit of the two operants as well but it returns one if at least one bit is set to one otherwise it returns zero. If at least one bit is one we will get one as the result of bitwise or. I hope this is clear to you. To make it more clear, let's see the truth table of bitwise or operator. Here is the truth table. From this truth table, we can conclude that when at least one bit is set to one, we will get one as the result of bitwise or otherwise we will get zero. Now where do we use the bitwise or operator? We use it to set specific bits to one of a specific number. Now let's take an example. Let's say we have the same binary number 10 0 1 and we want to set this bit to one. For this purpose, we need to set the corresponding bit to one in the second operint as well. So we will get the second operint as 0 0 1 0 which is same as two in decimal. Now we can perform bitwise or of these binary numbers. We will get 1 0 1 1 as the result which is same as value 11 in decimal. So clearly bitwise or of 9 and 2 is 11. Now why is this happening? Why are we getting this result? We can observe this from this truth table as well. When in the second operent we set a specific bit to one, we would be able to set the corresponding bit in the first operent to one. This is what we can observe. Now what happens when we set a specific bit to zero in the second operint? We would be able to extract the bit from the first operint. This means we will extract the corresponding bit. This is what we can observe here as well. We have set this bit to one because we want to set this bit to one and we want to obtain the remaining bits as it is. That's why we have set zeros here. So this is the reason why we are getting this output 1 0 1 1 which is same as 11. Now we can implement this through a C++ program. Here we have the values of a and b as 9 and 2 and I'm performing bitwise or operation on these two values. We know we will get 11 as the result. I hope this is clear to you. So with this we have understood the bitwise or operator as well. This means we are done with the second topic also and this means we are done with this lecture. Okay friends, this is it for now. Thank you for watching this lecture. I will see you in the next lecture where we will discuss some more bitwise operators. [Applause] [Music]"","

In the previous lecture, we understood relational operators in C++. We got to know that with the help of a relational operator, we can compare two values at a time and based on the comparison we will either get true or false as the result. Now we are in this lecture and the name of this lecture is logical operators in C++. In this lecture we will understand what are logical operators and what we can do with the help of logical operators. Apart from this we will also understand the relationship between logical operators and relational operators. So without any further delay, let's get started with this lecture and let's see what are the topics. The first topic is introduction to logical operators. First I will introduce you to logical operators. Then we will move to the next topic where we will understand logical and operator. After understanding logical and operator, we will understand logical or operator and logical not operator. After completion of these topics, we will then move to the last topic of this lecture where we will understand short circuit evaluation of logical operators. So these are the topics we need to understand in this lecture. Let's start with the first topic that is introduction to logical operators. So what are logical operators? A logical operator is an operator which is used to combine boolean expressions. With the help of a logical operator, we can combine boolean expressions. Now what is a boolean expression? A boolean expression is an expression that returns either true or false as the result. So clearly with the help of logical operators we can combine expressions that return either true or false as the result. So it returns either one or zero as the result. So clearly a logical expression which is an expression involving logical operators also return a boolean value that is it either return one or zero as the result where one represents true and zero represents false. Mostly it is used to combine relational expressions. With the help of logical operators, we can combine relational expressions that is expressions involving relational operators. So that's the relationship between logical operators and relational operators. With the help of logical operators, we can combine those expressions where relational operators are included. And we already know that a relational expression also returns a boolean value. So clearly a relational expression is also a boolean expression. So we can combine relational expressions with the help of logical operators. So I hope these points are completely clear to you. Now let's see what are the different types of logical operators we have in C++. There are a total of three logical operators we have in C++. The first one is the logical and operator which is represented by two amp% symbols. The second one is the logical or operator which is represented by two pipe symbols. And the third logical operator is the logical not operator which is represented by a single exclamation mark. So these are all the logical operators we have in C++. We will study them one by one in the subsequent topics. For now we are done with the introduction to logical operators. Now we are ready to move to the second topic where we will understand logical and operator which is the first logical operator we have. So what is the logical and operator? Logical and operator is the operator which returns true if and only if all the operants are true otherwise it returns false. So logical and operator returns true only when all the operants are true otherwise we will get false as the result. This can be understood with the help of the truth table of the logical and operator. Here is the truth table. Here we have these two operants A and B and logical and operator is applied on these operants. Now let us assume that A is true and B is true. Both the operants of the logical and operator are true. Therefore we will get true as the result. This is what I have mentioned here. Now what happens if a is true and b is false? In this case we will get false as the result because if any one of the operent of the logical and operator is false then we will get false as the result of logical and. Similarly when a is false and b is true then also we will get false as the result. And when a is false and b is false then also we will get false as the result. I hope this is clear to you. So clearly when both the operants of the logical and operator are true then we will get true as the result otherwise we will get false as the result. Now let's demonstrate this concept with the help of a simple C++ program. Here is the simple C++ program. I have included the io stream header file and here I'm using std see out. Inside this main function I have defined this variable val of type integer with value 10. Here I have defined this if else construct. Let me explain this briefly what if else is about. With the help of if else construct we can execute a specific block of code based on the condition. The condition is provided to if here I have provided these two conditions and these two conditions are combined with the help of logical and operator. Now based on this logical expression either this statement will execute or this statement will execute. If we get true from this logical expression then this if block will execute otherwise else block will execute. Now let's check these two conditions. Here we are using the variable val and we know the value of this variable is 10. So we can replace these two variables by 10. Now we are checking this condition. Is 10 greater than 5 and 10 less than 25? These two conditions are true. 10 is greater than 5 and 10 is also less than 25. Therefore, result of this logical and will also be true. That's what we have learned from the truth table as well. If both the operants of the logical and operator are true then the result of logical and will also be true. So here we will get true as the result. This means this statement will execute and we will get inside if on the screen. Please remember at a time only one block can execute. Either it will be the if block or the else block. Here the if block has been executed and due to this reason we are getting this output. So with this we are done with logical and operator and this means we are done with this topic. Now let's move to the third topic where we will understand logical or operator. So what is the logical or operator? Logical or operator is the operator that returns true if at least one operand is true otherwise it returns false. So it returns true when at least one operand is true. It is not mandatory that both the operands must be true. If at least one operand is true then we will get true as the result otherwise we will get false. This can be understood from the truth table as well. Here is the truth table of the logical or operator. You can observe when at least one operent is true then we are getting true as the result. When both the operants are false then only we are getting false as the result. Now let's demonstrate this with the help of an example. Again I took the same example program with some changes here. Now we have these two conditions and these two conditions are combined with the help of logical or operator. We know the value of this variable is 10. So these two will be replaced by 10. And we also know that 10 is not less than five and 10 is also not greater than 25. So these two conditions are not satisfied. They are false. And we know this already. If both the operants of the logical or operator are false then we will get false as the result. So from here we are getting false and this means this time the if block will not execute the else block will execute and because of this std see out we would be able to see inside else as the output. I hope this is clear to you. So with this we are done with the logical or operator as well. That is the third topic. Now let's move to the fourth topic where we will understand logical not operator which is the last logical operator we have in C++. So what is the logical not operator? Logical not operator is the only unary logical operator in C++. So up to now whatever the logical operator we have discussed were binary logical operators they can operate on two operants but this operator can operate on just one operand that's why this is called the unary logical operator. It returns true when the operand is false and false when the operand is true. This can be understood from the truth table as well. Let's say the operant is a. Here the logical not operator is applied before the operant. When operant a is true then not a will give us false and when a is false then not a gives us true. I hope this is clear to you. Now let's take an example. Here I'm checking this specific condition not. Well, we know the value of this variable is 10. So here we have not of 10. Now what is the meaning of not 10. Please understand that a nonzero value is treated as true and zero is treated as false. So whenever we have zero, this means we have false and any nonzero value is treated as true. We know this value is a nonzero value. So this will be treated as true and we also know that not of true is false. So we'll get false as the result from here. This means the else block will again execute and we will get inside else as the output. Now we are done with the logical not operator as well. This means we are done with the fourth topic also. Now let's move to the fifth topic to understand short circuit evaluation. So what is the concept of shortcircuit evaluation and why do we need to understand this topic? Let's understand this. Now short circuit evaluation is the behavior of logical operators where only as much of the expression is evaluated as necessary to obtain the result. So first of all it is the behavior of logical operators precisely the binary logical operators that is it is the behavior of the logical and operator and the logical or operator. So what happens because of this behavior? Only a specific portion of the expression will be evaluated which is necessary to obtain the final result of the logical expression. In case of the logical and operator, if the first operand is false, then the overall result is false. There is no need to evaluate the second operand. So clearly the second operent is not evaluated. This is short circuit evaluation. Now let me try to explain this in a better way. In case of the logical and operator, we already know that if any one of the operand is false, then the result will be false. If the first operent itself is false, then there is no need to evaluate the second operent because the entire expression will return false. So it does not make sense to evaluate the second operint. So only the first operent will be evaluated in this case and the second operent will not be evaluated. This is called the short circuit evaluation. There is the short circuit. only a part of the expression is evaluated not the entire expression. This is true when the first operand is false. But if the first operand is true then we cannot say whether the entire expression will be true or false then it depends on the second operent and therefore we need to evaluate the second operent. So that's why I'm saying that short circuit evaluation happens in case of logical and when the first operand is false. Now what about the logical or operator? With logical or operator if the first operand is true the overall result is true. So the second operand is not evaluated. Clearly we know this that in case of logical or operator there is no need to evaluate the entire expression if the first operent itself is true because if the first operent is true then the entire expression will be true no matter what second operent is. So there is no need to evaluate the second operent. So here we have the behavior of short circuit evaluation. I hope this is clear to you. Now this is not true in case when first operint is false. If the first operent is false then we don't know whether the entire expression will be false or true. It can be true, it can be false and it depends on the second operent. Therefore the second operent must be evaluated. But here there is no need to evaluate the second operint if the first operent is true. So here short circuit evaluation happens. I hope this concept is clear to you. To make it more clear, let's take one simple example program. Within this main function, I have defined variable A of type integer with value five. And here I have defined this if construct only. In this if construct, I have provided these two conditions and I have combined them with the help of logical or operator. Now what is this first condition? Here we have a equal to 5. We know that value of a is five. So this means this condition is true. Now we know the first operand of the logical or operator is true. If the first operand of the logical or operator is true then the overall expression will return true. There is no need to evaluate the second operint. This means behind the scenes A++ will not be evaluated and therefore this std c out will display five as the result. This happens because a++ is not evaluated. Value of a is not incremented by one. We know the entire expression is true. That's why this statement will execute and we will get five as the result. If you do not have any idea about short circuit evaluation then you may give answer as six because you may think that a++ will evaluate but that's not true. Here short circuit evaluation will happen only the first part of the logical or operator will get evaluated not the second part. I hope this idea is completely clear to you now. So with this we have understood the short circuit evaluation as well. This means we are done with the last topic of this lecture and we are done with this lecture. Okay friends, this is it for now. Thank you for watching this lecture. I will see you in the next one. [Applause] [Music]"""

In the previous lecture, we understood conditional operator in C++. We learned that conditional operator is a turnary operator because it accepts three operants. Now in this lecture we will understand relational operators. The focus of this lecture is to properly understand relational operators in C++. So without any further delay, let's get started with this lecture and let's see what are the topics. There is only one topic and the name of the topic is relational operators. So let's proceed further and let's understand what are relational operators. A relational operator is the operator through which we can compare two operants. So with the help of relational operator we can compare two operants. This means a relational operator is a binary operator. It can act on two operants. Now here is the second point. It returns either one or zero as the result. So there are only two possible outcomes. We will either get one or zero as the result. where one represents true and zero represents false. I hope this is clear to you. Now here is the third point. It is mostly used in conditionals and loops. A relational operator is mostly used in conditionals and loops. With the help of a relational operator, we can check a specific condition. That is we can compare two operants and based on the comparison we will either get true or false as the result. If we get true as the result then a specific task will get executed. This is something we will learn when we understand conditionals and loops. Later in this course we will understand conditionals and loops. For now, we just need to remember that with the help of a relational operator, we can compare two operants. And this means we can check a specific condition and perform task based on that condition. So I hope these points are clear to you about relational operators. Now with the help of an example program, let's try to understand how to use a relational operator in C++. Here in this example program, I have included the IO stream header file because here I'm using stdc out. Inside this main function, I have defined these variables A and B. Variable A is initialized with value 10 and variable B is initialized with value 20. These are integer variables. This is what we can observe. Then we have this integer variable result. And to this variable I'm trying to assign the result of a greater than b. Here I'm checking this specific condition. Is a greater than b? We know the value of a is 10 and value of b is 20. So I'm comparing 10 and 20 with the help of this relational operator greater than. I hope this is clear to you. We know that 10 is not greater than 20. So we will get zero as the result which is same as false. I have already mentioned this that with the help of a relational operator we either get zero or one as the result where zero represents false and one represents true. Here in this example we will get zero as the result. So clearly we know that variable result will hold value zero. Now we can display this value on the screen with the help of stdc out. When we execute this program, we will get zero as the output. I hope this is clear to you. We are getting zero because this condition is not satisfied or we can say this condition has turned out to be false. So with this we have learned how to use a relational operator in a C++ program. Later we will understand its actual usage. We will understand how to use relational operators in conditionals and loops. For now we know how to use a relational operator in a C++ program. In this program I have used this greater than operator which is a relational operator. But this is not the only relational operator available in C++. We have many relational operators. Now let's see those relational operators and let's try to understand their working. Here in this table I will list down different operations we have and corresponding to those operations I will also list down symbols examples and results. Here is the first operation less than symbol is less than and example is three less than six. Here I'm checking is three less than six. We know three is less than six. Therefore we will get one as the result which represents true. The second operation is greater than. Symbol is greater than and example is 3 greater than 6. We know three is not greater than six. So we will get zero as the result which represents false. The third operation is less than or equal to. symbol is less than combined with equal to. Here we have the example 3 less than equal to 6. Here I'm checking two conditions at the same time. I'm checking whether 3 is less than 6 and 3 is equal to 6. In other words, I'm checking two conditions at the same time. If any one of the conditions gets satisfied that is if we get true out of any of the conditions then the entire less than equal to will turn out to be true. This means from this condition we will get true as the result. We know that 3 is less than 6. Although 3 is not equal to 6 but at least 3 is less than six as one of the conditions is satisfied. So we will get one as the result. I hope this is clear to you. We are getting one as the result of this less than or equal to operator. So with this we have understood the third operation. Now let's move to the fourth operation. The fourth operation is greater than or equal to. Symbol is greater than combined with equal to. Example is three greater than or equal to 6. Here I'm checking whether 3 is greater than 6 or 3 is equal to 6. We know that 3 is not equal to 6 and 3 is not greater than six. This means none of the conditions are satisfied. Not even a single condition is satisfied and therefore we will get zero as the result. I hope this makes sense to you. If in place of six we have three then we will get true as the result because at least one condition is satisfied. We know that three is equal to three. Therefore we will get one as the result. Now here comes the fifth operation is equal to symbol is double equals sign. We have double equal as the symbol for is equal to. Example is 3= 6. We know 3 is not equal to 6. So we will get zero as the result. Now here is the last operation. The sixth operation which is not equal to symbol for not equal to is exclamation mark with equal symbol. And here is the example 3 not= 6. Here I'm checking whether 3 is not equal to 6. We know 3 is not equal to 6. So we will get one as the result. I hope these operators are clear to you. These are all the relational operators we have in C++. So with this we have understood what are relational operators. What are the different types of relational operators we have and with the help of these examples we have understood how these relational operators work. So with this we have understood the topic relational operators and this means we are done with this lecture. Okay friends this is it for now. Thank you for watching this lecture. I will see you in the next one. [Applause] [Music]"","

For this purpose, let's consider a scenario. Let's say we want to check whether a user is valid or not. For this, we need to check whether the age of the user is greater than or equal to 18 and the user is verified. This can be done with the help of logical and as follows. Is valid function is defined with the parameters age and very where represents verified. If age is greater than or equal to 18 and the user is verified then true will be returned otherwise false will be returned. If is valid function is called with values 20 and true we will get true as the result because these two conditions are satisfied. In this case we will get false because not all conditions are satisfied. So the output is true and false. Now we can replace if else with a single return statement and the logical and like this. In this return statement, we have combined conditions with the help of logical and. If we get true from these two conditions, then true will be returned otherwise false will be returned. So it works same as the previous code and we'll get the same output true and false. So if you want to combine multiple conditions and we are sure that the function is going to return either true or false then we can write the return statement with logical and like this.

In the previous lecture, we understood the comma operator in C++. Now we are in this lecture and the name of this lecture is conditional operator. In this lecture, we will properly understand the conditional operator in C++. So without any further delay, let's get started and let's see what are the topics. The first topic is the conditional operator. First we will understand the conditional operator. We will understand what it is and what it does. Then we will move to the next topic where we will understand why we need conditional operator. So these are the topics. Let's start with the first one that is the conditional operator. So what is the conditional operator? The conditional operator is the only turnary operator available in C++. By turnary I mean three. This means this operator accepts three operants. It needs a condition and two expressions. The first operent must be the condition and the remaining two must be expressions. We know what an expression is. An expression is something that evaluates down to a value. Condition is also an expression but it evaluates down to a boolean value. It gives us either true or false. This must be the first operant and the remaining two must be the expressions. Now based on the condition it evaluates one of the expressions. Based on the condition that we provide as the first operand to the conditional operator, any one of the expressions will get evaluated. To understand this point better, let's understand the syntax of the conditional operator. First, here we have this conditional operator. Conditional operator is the combination of question mark and colon. Before question mark we need to provide the condition and after question mark we need to provide expression one. After colon we need to provide expression two. Based on this condition either expression one will get evaluated or expression two. If the condition turns out to be true then expression one will get evaluated otherwise expression two will get evaluated. This means if the condition turns out to be false then expression two will get evaluated. I hope this is clear to you. Now to understand this syntax even better and to implement this behavior, let's take one example program. Here I have included the IO stream header file because in this main function I'm using std C out. Inside this main function, I have defined these two variables A and B. And I have initialized these two variables with these values 10 and 20. These variables are integer variables. After this, we have this line. And in this line, I have defined this variable maximum of type integer. To this variable, I want to assign the result of this expression. This is the conditional expression. I'm calling this a conditional expression because here we are using the conditional operator. Before this question mark, I have provided this condition a greater than b. Based on this condition, either a will get evaluated or b will get evaluated. We have this condition a greater than b and we know that value of a is 10 and value of b is 20. So we can replace a by 10 and b by 20 here. Now we have 10 greater than 20. We know that 10 is not greater than 20. Therefore we will get false here. As we are getting false here we know expression two will get evaluated which is b. This means we will get 20 here and this value will be assigned to variable maximum. I hope this is clear to you. So eventually from this expression we are getting value 20. Now we can print this value with the help of stdc out. When we execute this program we will get the output as 20. I hope this is clear to you. So with this we have understood how to use the conditional operator in a C++ program. Now I want you to focus on this specific line. By the way, we can replace this line by if else statement. If you already know C programming language, then you must know if else statement. If you don't know about if else then also there is no problem. I will explain what if else is by converting this line with if else statement. Let's do this. Now we have this line. We can convert this line to this equivalent if else statement like this. Of course, first we need to define the variable maximum. Then we have this if else statement. Here I'm checking this condition. This is the same condition. If a is greater than b then maximum is equal to a otherwise or else maximum is equal to b. This is the simple meaning of if else statement. I hope this is clear to you. If this condition is true then we know maximum variable will hold value of a otherwise or else maximum variable will hold value of b. This is the same functionality we were achieving with the help of the conditional operator as well. Here we are checking this condition is a greater than b. So we are checking if a is greater than b then maximum is equal to a otherwise maximum is equal to b. We are achieving the same functionality with the help of the conditional operator. So this line or this statement is same as this entire code. Clearly this is much shorter and cleaner compared to this code. So if you want a shorter or cleaner version of if else we can use the conditional operator. If you want to check condition and based on the condition if we want to evaluate an expression then we can use conditional operator especially when we want this in a single line. I hope this idea is clear to you. So with this we are done with the first topic that is the conditional operator. Now let's move to the second topic where we will understand why we need conditional operator. I have already mentioned this that if you want to check a condition and if we want to evaluate an expression based on that condition in the same line then we can use the conditional operator. But this is not the only reason why we should consider using conditional operator. There is one more reason why we should use conditional operator. Here is the reason I have mentioned. Conditional operator is used mainly when an expression can only be passed at the time of initialization based on some condition. When initialization is the only option and when an expression needs to be passed but the expression must be passed based on the condition then we use the conditional operator. In this situation, we use the conditional operator. Now to understand this point better, let's take one example program. Here again, I have included the IO stream header file. Inside this main function, I have defined these variables A and B and I have initialized them with values 10 and 20 respectively. These variables are constant integer variables. This means these variables can only be initialized. We cannot assign values to them later in the code. Also, I have defined this constant integer variable maximum and I want to initialize this variable with the result of this expression. Again here we have the conditional expression a greater than b then question mark a colon b. If this condition turns out to be true then a will be assigned to maximum. This means the value of a will be assigned to maximum otherwise value of b will be assigned to maximum. So maximum variable will be initialized to either the value of a or b. We know that a is not greater than b because value of a is 10 and value of b is 20. Therefore value of b will be provided to the variable maximum. We know that this variable will be initialized to value of b. I have done the initialization. I have not performed the assignment after this line of code. This means I have not assigned value to this variable later in the code. This is allowed. Therefore, this initialization is valid. Now here with the help of stdc out, I'm trying to display the value of this variable maximum. When we execute this program, we will get the output 20 because this statement is valid. I have initialized this variable. I have not assigned value later to this variable in this code. But what happens if we replace this conditional expression with if else statement? First of all, we cannot use if else statement here at the time of initialization because here we can only provide a value, a constant value or an expression. We cannot provide a statement because statement does not evaluate to a value. An expression is something that evaluates down to a value. So providing expression here is completely valid because initialization is possible with a value. But if else is a statement. A statement is something that does not evaluate to a value. It is the action or the command that we give to the computer. That's it. We do not get value from an if else statement because it is a statement. I hope this is clear to you. So here at the time of initialization, we cannot replace this conditional expression by if else. If we use if else like this then we will get error from the compiler because here I have not performed the initialization although a constant integer variable must be initialized here I'm trying to assign value to this variable later in the code now we know that this condition turns out to be false this means else block will get executed maximum equal to b will get executed but this is not allowed because this is the constant integer variable. We cannot assign value to this variable later in the code. Only initialization can be performed and we just learned that with the help of if statement we cannot perform initialization. So that is why we cannot use if else here. I hope this idea is clear to you and this is the reason why I have mentioned this point here. When initialization is the only option and when an expression needs to be provided based on the condition then we use the conditional operator. We cannot use the if else statement. I hope this idea is clear to you. So this is one situation where we use conditional operator in place of if else. Also I would like to mention this that conditional operator is not the complete replacement of if else. Conditional operator must be used in those situations when we want to provide the result of simple expressions to a variable. When we have block of code that is code with multiple lines then if else should be used. I hope this idea is clear to you. So with this we are done with the second topic also. Now we know why we need conditional operator and where we should use conditional operator. This means we are done with this topic and this lecture. Okay friends, this is it for now. Thank you for watching this lecture. I will see you in the next one. [Applause] [Music]"""
2esF7tScX9s,Frontend vs. Backend: What’s the Difference? #FrontEnd #BackEnd #Coding,"Ever wondered what really happens when you visit a website? 🤔
The frontend is everything you see and interact with: the design, buttons, and forms. The backend is what works behind the scenes, storing data, processing requests, and ensuring everything runs smoothly.

Think of it like a restaurant 🍽️:

Frontend → the dining area, menu, and service.

Backend → the kitchen where the real magic happens.

Both are essential; one can’t work without the other!

Not just what you see on the screen, but also everything happening behind the scenes. That's where the concepts of front end and back end come in. Let's make this simple. Imagine a website as a restaurant. The front end is the part you, the customer, interact with. The menu, the table setup, the decor, the way the waiter serves you. In web development, this is the design, the buttons, the forms, the text, the images, everything your browser displays. HTML structures the page. CSS styles it. And JavaScript makes it interactive. The back end is like the kitchen. You cannot see it, but it's where the main work happens. Taking your order, preparing the food, and making sure it's exactly what you asked for. In web development, the backend stores and processes data, handles users accounts and ensures the right information reaches the right place. Languages like Python, Java or PHP handles the logic while databases like MySQL or MongoDB stores the data. The important thing is the front end and the back end are not separate. They work as a team. Click a button on the front end and it might send a request to the back end. The back end processes that request and sends the result back through the server to be displayed instantly. This backend code is what makes website feel responsive and functional. So the front end is what you see and interact with. The back end is what powers it from behind the scenes. And both are essential. Just like a great restaurant need both an inviting dining area and a well-run kitchen. Both roles are crucial. But if you had to pick one, front end or back end, which one would you choose and why?

In the previous lecture, we understood increment and decrement operators. Now we are in this lecture and the name of this lecture is comma operator. In this lecture we will understand the concept of comma operator in C++. So without any further delay let's get started and let's see what are the topics. There is only one topic and the name of the topic is the comma operator. Let's proceed further and let's understand the comma operator. The comma operator is used to combine multiple expressions in the same line. With the help of the comma operator, we can combine multiple expressions that two in the same line. By expression, I mean something that evaluates down to a value. So an expression always gives us a value in return. I hope the meaning of expression is clear to you and I hope the meaning of comma operator is also clear to you. Comma operator is used to combine multiple expressions in the same line. Apart from this, it evaluates expressions from left to right and returns the result of the last expression. Comma operator evaluates all the expressions from left to right and it also returns the result of the last expression. Now to understand this point better, let's take one simple example program. Here in this example program, I have included the IO stream header file because in the main function, I'm using stdc out. Inside this main function, I have defined these two variables X and Y. variable y is initialized to two here. After this, we have this line x = within parenthesis y ++ 20, 30. Here I'm trying to store the result of y +a 20a 30 in variable x. Now if you observe this, this is an expression because it evaluates down to a value. This expression is formed from multiple expressions. Here we have a total of three expressions and they are all combined with the help of comma operators. We know with the help of comma operator we can combine multiple expressions in the same line. This is exactly what I am doing here. Here we have this expression y+ and I'm calling this an expression because it evaluates down to a value. We already know this is the post increment operator. It gives us some value. Then we have 20 and 30. These are values themselves. We can call them expressions too. So we have a total of three expressions. Now we need to evaluate this entire expression. And this will be evaluated by evaluating all these expressions from left to right. So first we need to evaluate y ++. We know this is post increment operator. With the help of this operator, we will get value three in the variable y. And here we will get the old value of y which is 2. So here in place of y ++ we will get two. Then we have value 20. This will be evaluated down to 20. Then we have 30. This will be evaluated down to 30. So we know what's the result of the last expression. The result of the last expression is 30 and this result will be returned to variable x. This is what I have mentioned here. With the help of comma operator, all the expressions will be evaluated from left to right. We have evaluated expressions from left to right. But the result of the last expression will be returned. We know the result of the last expression is 30. This will be returned. So we can say this expression will be evaluated down to 30. So we can say that this expression is equivalent to 30 and hence x is equal to 30. I hope this is clear to you. So we learned the purpose of the comma operator here. We are using comma operator to combine multiple expressions. After this with the help of stdc out I am trying to display the value of x. We know x is holding 30. So 30 will be displayed on the screen. Because of this std end l we will move to the next line. And then we have std c out with y. We know the value of y is three. This is the current value because of y ++ we got three here. That's why three will be displayed in the next line. So when we execute this program we will get output as 30 and three. These two are in the separate lines. Now I hope it is clear to you how to use the comma operator and why it is so useful. I would like to mention that here the comma is not acting as the operator but it is acting as the separator. This is exactly what I have mentioned here for variable declarations. Comma acts as the separator. It does not act as the operator. These are not expressions which will get evaluated. Here we have variable declarations. These variables are separated by this comma. I hope this is clear to you. So, comma plays different roles in different situations. Here comma is acting as the separator. Here these two commas are acting as the operators. I hope this is clear to you. Now you might be thinking where do we use comma operator? Here I have mentioned this comma operator is mainly used in loops. You may already know what loops are. If you have already studied C programming language or some other programming language then you might know about while loop for loop. In case of for loop sometimes we may need multiple expressions as the update expression. We may want to update multiple loop variables. For this purpose, we may need to combine multiple expressions. And for this, we can use the comma operator. In the for loop, let's say we have two variables I and J. These are loop variables. And we may want to increment these variables. For this purpose, we can write the update expression as I ++, J++. If we want to update these two variables in the same line, then we need to write I++, J++ as the update expression of the for loop. So with the help of this update expression, clearly we would be able to increment the two variables. So this is the main use case of the comma operator. With the help of the comma operator, we can combine expressions like I++ and J++ and therefore we can form a single expression from multiple expressions. So with this we have learned the comma operator properly. Now we know what is the comma operator, how to use the comma operator and where it is used. So with this we have learned the topic the comma operator. Now we are done with this lecture. Okay friends, this is it for now. Thank you for watching this lecture. I will see you in the next one.

Let's find this out by first understanding the meaning of declaration. Declaration of a variable refers to declaring properties of that variable to the compiler. When we declare a variable, we declare properties of that variable. That is we tell the compiler the name and the type of that variable. It is similar to telling the compiler that the variable exists somewhere in the project. So there is no need to allocate memory for the variable. So memory will not be allocated for the variable which is declared. For example, here I have declared this variable a of type integer. I have declared this variable with the help of extern keyword. Through this keyword I'm telling the compiler that this variable is defined somewhere else in the project. So don't define this variable that is memory must not be allocated for this variable. Now here comes the meaning of definition. Definition refers to creating a variable that is memory will be allocated for the variable. For example, here I have defined this variable A of type integer. Variable A will be defined. This means memory will be allocated for this variable. Now, here is one important point I want you to know. Multiple declarations are okay, but multiple definitions causes compilation error. We can have multiple declarations of a variable, but multiple definitions are not allowed. This will cause compilation error. Want to learn C++? Follow our C++ programming course."","

In the previous lecture, we understood arithmetic operators in details. We understood different types of arithmetic operators. Now we are in this lecture and the name of this lecture is increment and decrement operators in C++. The focus of this lecture is to understand increment and decrement operators. So without any further delay, let's get started and let's see what are the topics. The first topic is pre-increment and predicament operators. First we will understand pre-increment and preredcrement operators. Then we will understand post increment and post decrement operators. After covering these two topics, we will then cover side effects in C++ specifically associated with increment and decrement operators. So these are the topics. Let's start with the first one. Pre-increment and predment operators. So what are pre-increment and predment operators? With the help of these operators, we can increment or decrement a value by one. With the help of pre-increment operator, we can increment a value by one. Through predecment operator, we can decrement a value by one. And they are represented as plus x or -x. These are called pre-increment and predment operators because these operators are applied before the operand. And you can observe that these operators are unary operators. They can only be applied on one operint. And the operant here is x. I'm considering x as some variable. I hope this is clear to you. There is one more reason why we call these operators pre-increment and predicament operators. That reason is dependent on the functionality of these two operators. Here is this reason. First increment or decrement happens in case of pre-increment and predment operators. Then the updated value is returned. That's what I have written here. So in case of pre-increment operator first the increment of the value happens. This means the value is incremented by one and then the updated value is returned. In case of predecment operator first the value is decremented by one and then the updated value is returned. I hope this point is clear to you. Now how this point is justifying that these operators are called pre-increment and predment. Why they are called so this is because the increment or decrement happens before the value is returned. Because of this we call these operators pre-increment and predicament operators. I hope this is clear to you. Now let me justify these points and make you understand them better with the help of an example program. Here I have included the IO stream header file because I want to use stdc out here. In this main function I have defined this variable val of type int and I have initialized this variable val with value four. I have used list initialization as we know this is the recommended approach. Then after this with the help of std see out I'm trying to display the result of plus+ val. Here I have applied pre-increment operator on this variable val. We know according to this line first the increment happens and then the updated value is returned. Here we have plus+ val. We know that first this value will be incremented by 1. We will get five here. then this value is returned. This means in place of plus+ val we will get value five. So we know that after execution of this program five will be displayed on the screen because of this std see out and then after this because of std end l we will move to the next line and in the next line the result of minus minus val will be displayed on the screen. As you can observe this is provided to stdc out. Now here we have this minus minus operator which is the predecment operator. We know with the help of this operator first the value is decremented by one and then the updated value is returned. We know the current value of this variable is five. First five is decremented by one. We will get four. Then four is returned. This means in place of minus minus val we will get four. So now we know when we execute this program we will get this output five and four. I hope this is clear to you. We are getting five because of plus val and we are getting four because of minus minus val. So with this we have learned the concept of pre-increment and predment. I hope this is completely clear to you and I hope I have made these points clear to you. So with this we are done with the first topic that is pre-increment and predicament. Let's move to the second topic where we will understand the concept of post increment and post decrement. So what are post increment and post decrement operators? Again with the help of these operators we can increment or decrement a value by one and they are represented as X++ or X - where X is some variable. Here you can observe that these operators are applied after the operant. they are placed after the operand and that's why we call these operators post increment and post decrement operators. This is the post increment operator and this is the post decrement operator. The word post means after pre means before. I hope this makes sense. Now I would like to mention the functionality of post increment and post decrement operators. First the copy of the value is created. Then the value is incremented or decremented. I am talking about the original value and then finally the copy is returned. It seems like first the value is returned and then the increment or decrement happens. That's why we call these operators post increment and post decrement. Increment or decrement happens after the value is returned. In case of pre-increment and predment operators, first increment or decrement happens, then the value is returned. But here the value is returned first. We will get the old value not the updated value and then the increment or decrement happens. I hope this idea is clear to you. Here we can observe the copy of the value is created. Original value is incremented or decremented and then the copy is returned. We are getting the old value not the new value as the result. Now let me properly justify this point and the other points mentioned here with the help of an example program. Again I took the same example program but with some updates. Here in place of plus plus val we have val plus+ and in place of minus minus val we have val minus minus. Here I have applied post increment and post decrement operators on variable val. Because of this post increment operator first the copy of this value is created. We will get the copy of this value that is four. Then the increment happens on the original value. This is the value and this value will be updated y1. We will get five here. This means variable val is updated to five. Then we will get the copy as the result. This means in place of val++ we will get four as the result. So clearly as the output we will get four here. Then after this in the new line we will get the result of val minus minus. We know the current value of this variable val is five. First the copy of five is created. Then five is decremented by one. We will get four in this variable val. And then the copy that is five is returned. This means in place of val minus minus we will get five. So what is the output of this program? Clearly when we execute this program we will get this output four and five. We are getting four because of val ++ and five because of val minus minus. If you remember in case of pre-increment and predment we were getting the output as five and four but here we are getting four and then five. So clearly there is the difference between pre-increment and post increment and predicament and post decrement. In case of pre-increment and predment, first the value is incremented or decremented and then the updated value is returned. But here the increment or decrement happens after the value is returned. we are getting the old value in this case. I hope this idea is clear to you. So with this we have understood the second topic also that is post increment and post decrement. Now let's move to the last topic where we will understand the concept of side effects. So what is a side effect? Here I have mentioned the meaning of side effect. When an operator does something in addition to returning a value, then it has a side effect. When some operator returns some value and apart from returning a value, it also does something else then that operator is said to be having a side effect. Now let me explain this with the help of some examples. Here I have defined this variable rest one of type int and I have initialized this variable with value five and here I have done the initialization through this copy initialization method that is with the help of this assignment operator. Now one thing we know that assignment operator helps taking the right hand side value to the left hand side variable. It simply stores the value which is available in the right hand side to the left hand side variable. Apart from this, it also returns the right hand side value. So if we apply this expression rest 1 equal to 5 on stdc out that is if we try to print the result of rest one equal to 5 then we will get five as the result because the assignment operator also returns the value which is available in the right hand side. So clearly assignment operator is doing two jobs. it is returning the value and it is assigning the right hand side value to the left hand side variable. So we can say the assignment operator has the side effect. Now what about this line here we have int rest two equal to plus rest one. Here I have defined this variable rest two of type int and I want to assign the result of plus plus rest one to this variable rest two. Now what does this mean? Here we have the pre-increment operator. Pre-increment operator also has a side effect. Now why am I saying this? It does not only update the value which is available in rest one but it also returns the updated value. That's the job of this plus operator. So clearly it is doing two things. Apart from returning the value, it is also updating the variable. So that's why we can say that the pre-increment operator has a side effect. It is not true only for the pre-increment operator. Every increment and decrement operator has this effect. This means they all have side effect. They do two jobs. I hope this idea is clear to you. Now you might be thinking why I'm explaining this concept to you. This is because I want you to remember this line and I want you to avoid this at all costs. Please see this line here. I have written avoid updating and using a variable with side effects in the same line. Always try to avoid using a variable and updating that variable in the same line which has the side effects. Let's say you are trying to update a variable with the help of some operator which has the side effect and you're using the same variable in the same line then it will cause problems. Now let me explain this with the help of an example. Here I have defined this variable where and I have initialized this variable with value five. Again I'm using copy initialization here. If you want you can use list initialization. Here I have defined this variable result of type int. And here I'm trying to assign the result of where ++ where now I want you to focus on this expression here with the help of this pre-increment operator. I'm trying to update the value of where. We know that pre-increment operator has a side effect. it not only updates the value of this variable, it also returns that value as the result. Now if you observe this expression properly clearly I'm updating this variable with side effect and I'm using this variable in the same line. This will cause problems. What kind of problems we will get from here? We do not know whether where will be evaluated first or plus where will be evaluated first. This means we do not know whether this variable where will receive the old value or the updated value. So in this case we have problems. If let's say where will be evaluated first then we will get five and in place of plus pair we will get six because plus operator or the pre-increment operator will increment the value of this variable where we will get six here and we will also get the value here. So clearly we will get six here. So we have this expression 5 + 6 which is equal to 11. Now do you think that the result variable will hold this value 11? What if plus+ where will be evaluated first? Then in place of plus+ where we will get six. We know now the variable where has the value six. So clearly this variable where will receive the updated value. So here we will get six not five. So now we have this expression 6 + 6 which evaluates to 12. Now do you think result variable will hold value 12? The answer to this question is we do not know this. This is the undefined behavior. This is not defined in C++. It is meant to be defined by the compiler. We don't know how the compiler will do the evaluation. We don't know this whether where will be evaluated first or plus+ where will be evaluated first. So this is the undefined behavior and this is the reason why we should avoid updating and using a variable with side effects in the same line. I hope this idea is clear to you. This is important because we do not get the same result every time in every machine. It is possible that in your machine you will get the result as 11. Maybe in some other machine you will get the result as 12. So the result is not fixed. That's why I'm saying try to avoid this at all costs. So with this we have understood the concept of side effects and what we need to follow as the best practice. So with this we are done with the third topic and now we are done with all the topics of this lecture. Okay friends this is it for now. Thank you for watching this lecture. I will see you in the next one. [Music] [Applause] [Music]"","

Let us compare CSE and IT the right way. Both CSE that is computer science engineering and IT that is information technology belong to the tech family but they focus on different aspects. CSE dives deeper into fundamentals of computing like algorithms, data structures, operating systems, computer architecture and even compiler design. So if you are into programming, problem solving and how computer actually work, CSE is your domain. On the other hand, it is more about using technology effectively. It focuses on database management, networking, cyber security, system administration and software deployment. It is less about theory more about real world applications. Both the branches open roles to roles like software developer, data analyst, system engineer. But CSC graduate may lean towards research and development or hardcore software development. While IT graduates often land in infrastructure, support or application management roles. The first year is usually common for both, but from the second year, CSE gets more theoretical and math heavy. It stays closer to practical tools and services. In conclusion, both CSE and IT offer great careers. Choose CSSE if you love coding and computer science in depth. Go for IT if you prefer applying technology to solve real world problems. Understanding the difference helps you choose smarter. Still wondering about other branches? Let us know in the comments. We might feature your question next."","

We have completed chapter number two, basics of C++. Now we are in this chapter, chapter number three and the name of this chapter is operators in C++. In this chapter we will understand different types of operators we have in C++. We are starting with arithmetic operators and this is the first lecture of this chapter. In this lecture we will understand arithmetic operators in details. So without any further delay let's get started with this lecture and let's see what are the topics. The first topic is introduction to arithmetic operators. First I will introduce you to arithmetic operators. Then we will move to the next topic where we will understand unary arithmetic operators. After this we will understand binary arithmetic operators and then finally I will give you some important points associated with arithmetic operators. So these are all the topics. Let's start with the first one that is introduction to arithmetic operators. So what are arithmetic operators? Arithmetic operators are used to perform basic mathematical operations. So with the help of arithmetic operators we can perform basic mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division etc. Also an arithmetic operator mainly works with numeric types like int, float and double. We know with the help of arithmetic operators we can perform basic mathematical operations. Now in order to perform basic mathematical operations data must be of numeric type like int, float and double. I hope this point is also clear to you. Now I would like to mention that there are two types of arithmetic operators. We have unary arithmetic operators and we have binary arithmetic operators. Now we will discuss these two operators properly. But for now we are done with the introduction to arithmetic operators. This means we are done with the first topic. Let's move to the second topic and let's understand unary arithmetic operators properly. So what is a unary arithmetic operator? Unary arithmetic operator is the operator that needs one operent. So it can perform operation on one operent or a single value. Operant represents a value. That's why the name unary arithmetic operators. Here this word unary means one. I hope this is clear to you. There are two types of unary arithmetic operators. We have unary plus and unary minus. Now let's understand how to use these operators in C++ programs. For this purpose, we will take a simple example program in C++. Here I have included the IO stream header file because I want to use stdc out in this function. I have defined the main function and in this main function I have defined this variable val of type int. This means this variable can hold an integer value. I have initialized this variable with value minus4. This is an integer value. Therefore this statement is valid. Then after this with the help of stdc out I want to display the result of plus val. Now here to this variable I have applied this unary plus operator. This means I have specified the sign of this variable. We know that val is the variable which is holding this value minus4. So clearly this variable will be replaced by minus4 at the time of execution. Now we have + -4. We know that plus will not affect the value. We will get -4 as the result because + -4 is same as minus4 in mathematics. So clearly in this case we will get minus4 as the result. You can observe this is the unary plus operator because this operator is applied on just one operand. I hope this is clear to you. So we know that after execution of this line we will get minus4 on the screen and after this because of std end l we will move to the next line and in the next line the result of std see out will be displayed which is written over here. So here we have this std see out line and here I have specified minus 12. Now we know what happens in this case. We know that at execution time this variable will be replaced by -4. Now we have - -4. We know what is the result of -4. This minus sign will change the sign of the original value. We will get +4. So - -4 is same as +4. We will get the result as +4. So when we execute this program we will get the output as minus4 and four where four is same as +4. I hope this is clear to you. We are getting these outputs in two lines because of std and l. Now I would like to mention that unary plus operator is not that useful in programming because it does not affect anything in the program. So clearly if we remove this plus sign from here we will get the same output. So I would recommend not to use unary plus operator although you can use unary minus operator based on your needs. So with this we have understood unary arithmetic operators properly. This means we are done with the second topic also. Now let's move to the third topic where we will understand binary arithmetic operators. So what is a binary arithmetic operator? Binary arithmetic operator is an operator which can operate on two operants. So it needs two operants. Here we have the word binary. Binary represents two. I hope this is clear to you. Now I would like to list down all the binary arithmetic operators we have in C++. Here I will list down the operations. I will provide for each operation the symbol, example and result. The first operation is addition. Symbol is plus and simple example is 10 + 3. We will get 13 as the result of this expression. The second operation is subtraction. symbol is minus. Example is 10 minus 3. We will get seven in this case. The third operation is multiplication. Symbol is asterisk. We use asterisk for multiplication. Example is 10 * 3. We will get 30 as the result. Then we have the fourth operation division. Symbol is backslash. Example is 10 / 3. we will get three. In this case, we are getting integer value because the operants are integers. You will get to know about this in a moment. Finally, the fifth operation is modulus. It is represented with the help of percentage symbol. With the help of this symbol, we would be able to divide two numbers and we will get the remainder as the result. For example, if we divide 10 by 3, we will get one as the remainder. So in this case, we will get one as the result. I hope this is clear to you. So these are all the binary arithmetic operators we have in C++ programming language. I hope this is clear. This means we are done with the third topic also. Now let's move to the fourth topic where we will discuss some important points about arithmetic operators. Here is the first point. Result of division is floating point if either or both the operants are floating point. Always remember this. If one of the operants or both the operants are floating point values, then the result of division will also be a floatingoint value. For example, in this specific case, I have this expression 12 / 5.0. Here we have this floating point value as the operand. Clearly, we will get the result as 2.4. We are getting a floating point value here. If we have 12.0 0 in place of 12 and five in place of 5.0 then also we'll get the same result. If we have both the operants as floating point then also we will get the same result that is 2.4. I hope this is completely clear. Now let's move to the second point. Result of division is integer if both the operants are integers. When both the operants are inteious then the result of division is integer. So here in this example we have these two operants which are integers. In this case we will get an integer value as the result. I hope this is making sense to you. We are getting two not 2.4 because we have two integer operants here. Now here comes the third point. Division by 0 causes runtime error. Remember if we divide a number by zero then we will get execution time error. Maybe our program correctly compiles but at the time of execution we will get error. For example, if we try to divide 12 by 0 and if we display the result then of course we will get error. I hope this is clear to you. Now here comes the fourth point. Division by 0.0 0 gives either INF or N. INF represents infinity and N A N represents not a number. We will get either of these two when we divide a number by 0.0. For example, in this case, I'm trying to print the result of 12 / 0.0. In my case, I got IF as the result. Maybe you will get N. This depends on the system. Also remember that if the system is following ILE E 754 representation for floating point numbers then only we will get result as INF or N. If some other representation is used then it is possible that we will get error at execution time. This totally depends on this system. Although I would like to mention that do not divide a number by 0 or 0.0. So with this we have covered these important points and this means we are done with the fourth topic also and we are done with this lecture. Okay friends, this is it for now. Thank you for watching this lecture. I will see you in the next one. [Applause] [Music]"","

Let's try to understand this concept. The and operator returns the first falsy value or the last operint if all are truthy. Falsy value is a value which represents false and a truthy value represents true. So the and operator returns the first falsy value or it returns the last operand if all are truthy values. For example, in this expression five and three, three will be returned because both five and three are truthy values. So we will get three as the output. In this expression also and operator is used. And here we have the first falsy value zero. So this will be displayed on the screen. Now what about the or operator? The or operator returns the first truthy value or the last operant if none are truthy. For example, in this expression 0 or 7, 7 is the first truthy value. Therefore, seven will be returned and displayed on the screen because or operator is used. And in this expression also or operator is used. But here we have falsy values. Therefore, we will get the last operand that is zero will be displayed on the screen. Now, what can we say about the not operator? The not operator always returns a boolean value no matter what. For example, not zero returns true because zero is a falsy value and not high returns false because high is a truthy value. So that's the concept of logical operators returning values other than boolean values. Want to learn Python in depth? Follow our Python programming course."","

I am Kushi Jan and if you have just joined an engineering college or you are about to, congratulations. You're officially stepping into one of the most exciting chapters of your life. It is going to be a lot of things. Fun, challenging, occasionally overwhelming, and a little chaotic. Trust me, especially if you're not prepared. Now, if you are anything like I was during my first year, you are probably wondering, """"What do I need to carry? What should I pack? What will I regret not bringing when I'm needy in assignments? Or worse, when I have burnt my tongue trying to eat Maggie straight from the kettle?"""" Well, don't worry. In this video, I'm going to walk you through everything you will need as a fresher in an engineering college. So from the kind of laptop that makes sense for you to a study lamp that will save your friendship with your roommate. From first aids to kettles, calculators to notebooks, this is the real practical checklist for anyone starting college, especially if you're staying at hostel. All right, let's begin with probably the one thing everyone is most excited about, the laptop. Now here is the truth. You don't need to go all out with some high-end ultra spec machine in your first year. Unless your branch requires heavy software like architecture or design. Your regular coursework would need a powerhouse. What really matters is that it runs smoothly, handles multitasking effortlessly, and does not freeze every time you open more than two tabs. We recommend a lightweight laptop with a 512GB SSG. For the processor, Intel i5 or AMD Ryzen 5 are both great for student use. As for RAM, go for at least 8 GB, but if you can stretch it to 16 GB, you will find it beneficial in the long run, especially if you like to keep multiple apps or browser tabs open at once. Just make sure whatever you choose is reliable, has good battery life, and is easy to carry around. You will be grateful for all of that when you're racing to submit a lastminute assignment or working late in the library. And while we are talking about your laptop, do not forget to carry a good pen drive. Something like 32 or 64 GB will do the job. You might think you will always use Google Drive or email things to yourself. But there will be times especially during lab session or practical examinations where internet access is limited or you're asked to submit your code or file through a physical medium. A pen drive is still one of the fastest and safest ways to carry important files, projects, or even software installers between systems. Just label it. Don't leave it plugged into lab computers. They vanish quickly. Now, since a lot of your essential tech like your phone, earphones, and smart devices runs on battery, and college life is unpredictable, a power bank becomes a real lifesaver. Whether you are in class, in the library, or stuck during a long day with no charging point in sight. Having one of these means you're never cut off. Go for something compact but reliable around 10,000 to 20,000 mAh and preferably with fast charging support. You will be surprised how often you reach for it especially during fest trips or exam season when you're out all day. Now obviously all your tech is going to live in your bag most of the time. So let's talk about that too. Please please do not bring your old school bag from 11th grade. Get yourself a solid waterproof backpack. Look for one that is padded, has a dedicated laptop compartment, and enough space for notebooks, a water bottle, and your umbrella. Yes, carry one because you will inevitably get caught in an unexpected downpour when you least expect it, and a few other daily essentials. Make sure it has wide cushion straps. Your back will thank you later. Now coming to the thing that most students underestimate in college note takingaking. You're going to be attending a lot of theory classes, labs and sometime tutorials and trying to carry five different notebooks for five different subjects that gets messy fast. Instead consider something like a five subject spiral notebook. It is neat. It is organized and it makes life so much simpler. Each section can be used for one subject and you're always carrying everything in one place. You will not ever sit in class thinking, """"Oops, wrong notebook."""" Now, let's talk about something you will carry into every exam room for the next 4 years. Your calculator. You don't need anything fancy, just a reliable, non-programmable scientific calculator like the Casio 82MS. Most colleges approve this model and they cover all the calculations you will ever need from triggrometry to mattresses. And please write your name on it. Calculators disappear faster than your attendance marks if you're not careful. Okay, now this next part is boring but important. A basic first aid kit. Just carry one. I promise you will need it and usually at the worst times. Pack it into a small box and make sure you have got some band-aids, antiseptic cream, cotton, detl, and a small bandage roll. Also include paracetamole, ant acid or an anti-allergy tablet. And if you're someone who is prone to headaches or stomach issues, take whatever medicine you usually take. A pain relief spray is also great to have, especially after hostile football matches. That gets a little too competitive. Speaking of fasters, that is a world of its own. And while the experience is unforgettable, there are a few things you will wish you had the very first week. For starters, an electric kettle. Now, I know, I know a lot of college hosts technically don't allow these in rooms. So, here's the deal. Before you pack one, check with your seniors or your hostel warden. Sometimes there are workarounds like keeping it tucked away and only using it responsibly. And in some hostel it's just a strict no. So ask first. Don't assume. That said, if you can manage to keep one, it's a total game changer. It's not just for tea. It becomes your best friend when the mess food feels like personal attack. You can make Maggie, boil eggs, mix up coffee during late night study sessions. Even heat water for instant oats or readymade soup. It's basically a survival tool disguised as an appliance. Then there is the study lamp. This might seem minor until your roommate wants to sleep and you have got an internal viva the next morning. A good lamp means you get to study without disturbing anyone. Also, don't forget an extension board. In most host, power sockets are limited and shared. Get one with surge protections so you can charge your phone, laptop, lamp, and kettle all in one go. Something else I swear by, a mini suing kit. You won't believe how often you will need it. A popped up button on your shirt 5 minutes before the class. This fixes it. It's one of those things you don't realize is essential until it's too late. And while we are at it, don't forget a good pair of earphones or even noiseancelling headphones. College host can get loud between snoring roommates, corridor chatter, late night birthday parties. Sometimes you just need your own bubble. A lot of students, especially those into coding, designing, or long study sessions, like listening to music while they work. And honestly, it's great. Music helps you focus, block out distractions, and makes boring task feel lighter. But here is a small suggestion, and it's something I have learned the hard way. When you're doing a problem solving or revising something you already know, music works beautifully. But if you're trying to learn a new concept or understand a difficult theory for the first time, it's better to keep things silent. A distraction-free environment really helps you with a focused study and long-term retention. So, mix it up. Know when to plug in and when to pause the playlist. Also, water bottle. Yes, it sounds basic, but get a reusable, preferably an insulated one. You will always have access to clean water and it is one of those small thing that goes a long way. And if you're moving into a hostel for the first time, it helps to bring a small comfort item from home. Maybe a favorite blanket or a framed photo or something familiar. It can make those first few days a lot easier emotionally. Before we wrap up, let me just drop a quick mention of a few digital tools that can help you stay organized. Use apps like OneNote or Notion to manage your notes. This sync across devices and makes revision so much easier. Adobe scan is great for submitting scanned assignments. And Google Calendar, this is a game changer. You'll never miss a test or class again if you actually use it. You could also use a simple habit tracking app to build consistency, especially if you're trying to stay regular with your lectures, gym, or study goals. Trust me, college is where good habits start or end. And these little apps will help you more than you think. So that's your starter kit for an enduring college life. Remember, it's not about having everything from day one. It's about knowing what actually helps. Start small, settle in, and figure it out as you go. College is a learning curve, not just in class, but in life, too. Take it one step at a time and enjoy the ride. And hey, before you go, drop a comment below. If you have already made your own list and it looks a little different from ours, share it. If you are a senior who has been through first year already, tell us what you wish someone had told you. And if you have already graduated and you're watching this just for nostalgia, we would love to hear your first day memories or hostel hacks. Your experience might just help someone else starting out. Thanks for watching and welcome once again to the start of an unforgettable journey. We'll see you in the next one."","

In the previous lectures, we discussed different types of type specifiers. Now we are in this lecture and the name of this lecture is comments in C++. In this lecture, our focus will be on understanding comments in C++. We will understand what comments are and why we include comments in our C++ code. So without any further delay, let's get started with this lecture and let's see what are the topics. The first topic is introduction to comments. First I will introduce you to the world of comments. Then we will move to the next topic where we will understand single line comments. After understanding single line comments, we will understand multi-line comments. So these are the topics. Let's start with the first topic that is introduction to comments. So what is a comment? A comment is a text ignored by the compiler. So a comment is some text we add in our source code which is completely ignored by the compiler. Now you might be thinking if a comment is completely ignored by the compiler then why do we add a comment in the source code it will not get evaluated then why do we add comment there are two main reasons why we should consider adding comments in our C++ programs the first reason is with the help of comment we can explain what the code is doing with the help of comment s it is possible to explain what the code is about and what the code is doing in the program. And the second reason is with the help of a comment we can explain why a particular approach is taken. We may have chosen a specific approach to solve a problem. Now why that approach has been chosen? We can specify this with the help of comments. I hope this is clear to you now. So these are the two main reasons why we should consider adding comments in our programs. Comments are mainly used to explain what the code is doing and why a particular approach is taken. Now let's move to the third point. Comments are useful to make notes for developers reading the code in future. So comments are quite useful in adding notes so that fellow developers would be able to understand our code better. If they want to read our code and understand the code then they would be able to do it because with the help of comments we have made our code more readable and understandable. So I hope with these points it is clear what a comment is and what significance they hold. Now I would like to tell you that there are two types of comments in C++. We have single line comments and we have multi-line comments. A single line comment is added with the help of two backslashes and a multi-line comment is added with the help of back slashaststerisk and asterisk backslash. We will understand what are singleline comments and multi-line comments properly. For now we have understood what a comment is and why they are useful. So we are done with the first topic that is introduction to comments. Now let's move to the second topic where we will understand single line comments. So what is a single line comment? A single line comment is a comment in a single line. The name itself suggests the same thing and it is added with the help of two backslashes. If you want we can use a shortcut to add a single line comment. There we do not have to type out these two backslashes. We can use this shortcut control and backslash in Windows or we can use command and backslash in Mac. So we have shortcuts to add a single line comment. I hope this is clear to you. Now let's try to understand how to add a single line comment in a C++ program. Here in the C++ program, I have included the IO stream header file. I have included this header file because I want to use stdc out in this main function. Now in this main function, I have added this single line comment prints nesso academy. This single line comment has been added to explain what this code is about. This single line comment is added just before this line of code to tell what this line of code is about. This line of code has the capability to print Nesso Academy on the screen. And we know this already. With the help of STDC out, we can display this text on the screen. So this comment is clear to someone who does not know anything about std out. So this line of comment makes our code more readable. Now when we execute this program we know we get the output Nesso Academy on the screen. So in this way we can add a single line comment. A single line comment must always begin with two backslashes. Then we can add the comment we want. I hope this is clear to you. Now I would like to tell you one interesting use case of a single line comment. With the help of a single line comment, we can comment out a single line of code. This can be done to test a new version of that line of code. Let me demonstrate this with the help of this example. Let's say we want to print hello world on the screen instead of printing Nesso Academy. For this purpose, we can remove this line of code and we can add a new line of code to print hello world on the screen. But we do not have to do this. We can comment this line out with the help of two backslashes like this. Here we have commented this line out. This means we have this line of code in our program but compiler has to do nothing with this. Compiler will not evaluate this line of code because now this is not a single line of code. This is a single line comment. I hope this is clear to you. Now we can test the new version. We can type out this line of code to print hello world on the screen. When we execute this program, we will get hello world on the screen. We got this even we did not delete this line of code. So we kept the old version of the code and we tested the new version. The new version is working correctly. So now we can remove this line of code. After removing this line of code, this is how our code looks like. Now we can replace this Nesso Academy by hello world to make it more clear. So this line of code has the capability to print hello world on the screen. That is what it is doing. I hope this is clear to you. So with the help of single line comment, we can comment out a specific line of code to test the new version of that code. I hope this is clear. This is not just the case with single line comment. If we want to comment out a block of code or multiple lines of code, then we can use multi-line comment. We will learn about multi-line comments in the next topic. For now, we have understood single line comments properly. This means we are done with the second topic also. Now, let's move to the third topic and let's understand multi-line comments. So what is a multi-line comment? A multi-line comment is a comment in multiple lines as the name itself suggests. Also a multi-line comment can be added with the help of back slashaststerisk and asterisk backslash. back slash asterisk denotes the beginning of the multi-line comment and asterisk backslash indicates the end of the multi-line comment. Within these two we can specify the multi-line comment that we want and this will be completely ignored by the compiler. Also if we do not want to type this out then we can use a shortcut. We can use control shift and backslash in Windows or we can use command shift and backslash in Mac. So I hope these points are clear to you. Now let's understand how to add a multi-line comment in a C++ program. Here we have this main function only. I have not included the IO stream header file because here I'm not using stdc out. It is not mandatory to add IO stream header file. If you need the IO stream header file, then only include it. In this case, we do not need the IO stream header file. Here I have defined this main function. And within this main function, I have added this multi-line comment. This is the multi-line comment. Here we are beginning this comment with back slashaststerisk and we are ending this comment with asterisk backslash. Whatever we have written here is completely ignored by the compiler. I've added this comment. A variable is defined to store points. Here I have defined this variable points of type int and I have initialized this variable with value 100. With the help of this comment, I want to tell this that I have defined this variable to store points of something. I hope this is clear to you. So in this way, we can add a multi-line comment. Now if you observe this comment carefully, this comment is not adding anything significant here. Or we can say this comment is not that useful. If we remove this comment then also this line of code is clear to us. Here we have defined the variable points. Clearly this variable has been defined to store points of something. From the name of the variable itself it is clear what is the purpose of this variable. We have defined this variable to store points of something. So it does not make any sense to include this comment. So whenever we have an obvious code, it is not advisable to tell what that code is about. Here I have explained what this code is about. But this is not needed. Instead it is better to explain why you have added that code. Here I have added this explanation awarding 100 points to users signing up for the first time on our website. I've replaced the previous comment with this comment and now this is much better. Here I have explained the proper significance of this variable. I have explained why I have added this code, why I have defined this variable and why I have initialized this variable to 100. I have initialized this variable to 100 because I want to award 100 points to users signing up for the first time on our website. I hope this is making sense to you. Now this comment is useful and it is considered as one of the best practices to add comments in the code. Whenever we have an obvious piece of code, we must explain the why of that code, not the what. The what of the code should be explained when the code is difficult to understand and when the code is nonobvious. This code is obvious. So putting the explanation of why we have added this code makes much sense. So with this I hope this point is completely clear to you. We have understood multi-line comments properly. Now we are done with multi-line comments also. This means we are done with this topic and we are done with this lecture. Okay friends, this is it for now. Thank you for watching this presentation. I will see you in the next one. [Applause] [Music]"","

Let's find out. Point number one, use short and descriptive names. Always try to use short and descriptive names for your variables to indicate their purpose. For example, this variable name is not a good variable name because it does not depict anything. On the other hand, this one is much better because this indicates the purpose of the variable. Point number two, start with the letter or underscore. Always try to begin your variable names with a letter or an underscore. For example, this variable name is not valid because it begins with a digit. On the other hand, this one is perfectly valid. Point number three, use a consistent style. Always follow a consistent style for your variable names. For example, this variable is following the camel case convention where the first letter of the second word and the subsequent words are always capitalized. So this one is perfectly valid and you can follow this or you can follow the snake case convention where words are separated by underscores. So this one is also valid and you can follow this. So these are some of the variable naming conventions that you can follow. Now here is one question for you. Can we use special characters like at the rate, question mark, exclamation mark in our variable names? Post your answers in the comment section.

In the previous lecture, we understood the auto type specifier. Now we are in this lecture and the name of this lecture is the decal type specifier. In this lecture we will understand the second type of type specifier which is the decal type specifier. So without any further delay let's get started with this lecture and let's see what are the topics. The first topic of this lecture is the decal type type specifier. First we will understand what is decal type type specifier and through an example we will also implement the decal type specifier. Then we will move to the next topic where we will discuss the difference between auto type specifier and the decal type specifier. So these are the two topics which we need to understand in this lecture. Let's get started with the first topic that is the decal type specifier. So what is the decal type specifier? Decal type type specifier was introduced in C++ 11 and it allows compiler to deduce the type of a variable from another variable or an expression without using it as an initializer. Just like auto type specifier, decal type type specifier was introduced in C++ 11. Also, it allows compiler to deduce the type of a variable automatically for us. We do not have to specify the type. Compiler deduces the type on its own, but it deduces the type a little differently from the auto type specifier. If we compare the decal type specifier with the auto type specifier then the methodology is quite different. Let's now try to understand this. We know in case of the auto type specifier the type is deduced based on the initializer. So it is important to provide the initializer. But this is not the case with decal type specifier. In case of the decal type type specifier, the type is deduced from another variable or an expression without using it as an initializer. So the variable or an expression is directly provided in the declaration. It is not provided as the initializer. I hope the difference is clear to you. In case of decal type, we do not have to specify the type and type deduction happens from another variable or an expression provided in the declaration itself. That's why the name decal type decal type refers to declaration type. This means the type deduction is based on a variable or an expression passed directly in the declaration. it will not be provided as the initializer. So in case of decel type type specifier we do not have to provide the initializer. If you want we can but initializer does not play any role in type deduction. Now we have covered these two points. Let's move to the third point. It is useful when only the type information is needed from complex expressions. Decal type type specifier is useful in those situations when we want to deduce the type of an expression or a variable and we do not want to evaluate the expression or the variable. So I hope these three points are completely clear to you. Now through an example let's try to see the implementation of the decal type specifier. This is the example program. I have included the IO stream header file here. Apart from this header file, I have also included this header file type info. We will learn about this why I have included this header file here. Now let's move to the definition of the main function. In this main function, I have defined this variable where. But I have not provided the data type for this variable. Instead I have used the decal type type specifier here. Please remember the syntax. We need to provide the keyword decal type first. Then within parenthesis we can provide the variable of our choice or an expression. Here I have provided this expression 3 + 4.5. This expression will not be evaluated by the compiler. only type will be deduced from this expression. If we evaluate this expression, we know we get a double value. So, compiler knows that if we evaluate this expression, then we will get a double value. Therefore, the type of this variable must be a double type. I hope this is clear to you. understand that this integer value will be converted to a double value. Then these values will be added and then we will get a double value. So clearly the data type here is the double. But remember this expression will not be evaluated by the compiler. So now we know what's the type here. We will get double type here. So clearly variable v is of type double. Now let's say we want to verify this. For this I have written this line with the help of std see out. I want to display something on the screen. I want to display the type of this variable. For this purpose I have used this operator type id and to this I have passed this variable where. This operator helps us in getting the type of this variable and this operator is available in this header file type info. So now I hope it is clear to you why I have included this header file. We need to include this header file to use this operator type id. This will give us the type. Now if we want to display the type in string format then we need to use this name method here we have this dot operator then the name method which is defined like this. I hope this is clear to you. So in this way we will get the data type on the screen for this variable. Now when we execute this program we will get D as the output where D represents double. This means our program is working correctly. This variable has been defined correctly. The data type of this variable is double. Now let's modify this program a bit. Let's say in this expression instead of having 3 + 4.5 we have 3 + 4. Now we have two integer values here. Clearly if we evaluate this expression we will get an integer value only. So clearly the data type here is int. This will be deduced automatically by the compiler. We will get int data type here from the compiler. Clearly when we execute this program we will get I as the output which represents an integer. I hope this is clear to you. So with the help of these points and the program we learned what is the decal type specifier and how to use this specific type specifier in our C++ programs. This means we are done with the first topic that is the decal type specifier. Now let's move to the second topic where we will understand the difference between auto and decal type. So what's the difference between these two type specifiers? Let's understand them one by one. Here comes the first point. Auto type specifier needs an initializer. As already mentioned, we know this already that auto type specifier needs an initializer because compiler has to deduce the type from the initializer. So it is important to provide the initializer when we define a variable of type auto. What happens in case of decal type specifier? Here we do not have to specify the initializer. In the programs we have discussed, we have defined the variable without initializing it. Clearly, we have not provided the initializer because initializer does not play any role in determining the type of the variable. So clearly in case of decert type specifier, we do not need an initializer. But we can provide an initializer. it will not play any role in deducing the type of the variable. Now here comes the second point. Auto type specifier is used when type needs to be deduced from initializer. As already mentioned when the type needs to be deduced from an initializer then we use the auto type specifier. when we do not want to deduce the type from the initializer then we use decal type type specifier. So here I have written it is used when type needs to be deduced from some other variable or expression which is not an initializer. I hope this is clear to you. Now here comes the third point. Auto type specifier evaluates expression used as an initializer. This means the initializer will get evaluated. It is not the case that only type will be deduced from the initializer. Initializer will also get evaluated. But this is not the case with decal type specifier. We know that the expression or a variable that we pass to decal type will not get evaluated. That's what I have written here does not evaluate expression. Only the type will be deduced by the compiler. So I hope these differences are clear to you. So this makes it clear what's the difference between auto type specifier and decal type specifier. Also I would like to mention just like auto type specifier we use decal type type specifier in situations when the types are quite long and obvious. We will learn about this when we will discuss STL templates and other complex types. There we will get to know the importance of these type specifiers. So with this we have understood the difference between auto and decal type. This means we are done with the second topic also and this means we are done with this lecture. Okay friends, this is it for now. Thank you for watching this presentation. I will see you in the next one. [Applause] [Music]"""

No, not exactly. And choosing the right one could impact your career. Let me break it down in under 2 minutes. If you are planning to study engineering, you have probably seen both BTE and BE on college brochers or website. So what is the real difference and does it actually matter? So both are undergraduate degrees in engineering. B stands for Bachelor of Technology. PE stands for Bachelor of Engineering. Now, in most cases, they are treated the same by companies. They care more about your skills, the project you have done and your college reputation. But there is a slight difference in the approach. BTE is usually more practical, more labs, more hands-on learning, more focus on how things work in the real world. BE is a bit more theoretical, more academic, more focused on the fundamentals. In India for example, IITs and NITs both offer BTE courses. Most state universities and some private colleges offer BE. So a lot of the time the degree just depends on where you are studying. Now which one you should go for? If you are into building stuff, doing projects and jumping into industry fast, BTE might be a better fit. But if you are aiming for research, higher studies or deep theory, be could work better. But here is the bottom line. Whether it is BTech or BE, what really matters is what you do during those four years. Your projects, your internships, and how much you actually learn. Hope that cleared things up.

In the previous lecture, we understood the type conversion in C++. Now we are in this lecture and the name of this lecture is the auto type specifier. In this lecture, we will understand the auto type specifier properly. So without any further delay, let's get started with this lecture and let's see what are the topics. The first topic of this lecture is the autotype specifier. First I will make you understand what is the autotype specifier. Then we will move to the next topic where we will discuss some important points about the auto type specifier. So these are the two topics which we need to understand in this lecture. So let's get started with the first topic that is the auto type specifier. So what is the autotype specifier? Autotype specifier was introduced in C++ 11 and it allows compiler to deduce the type of a variable from its initializer. So autoype specifier allows compiler to deduce the type of a variable that to automatically without the need of us typing the type of the variable. So we do not have to specify the type of the variable when we specify the type of the variable as auto. With auto the type of the variable will be automatically deduced by the compiler and this is done based on the initializer. This is what I have mentioned here. Now what is initializer? Initializer is a value which is used to initialize a variable. That's why it is called initializer. And I hope the meaning of autotype specifier is making sense to you. The word auto means automatic. And type specifier is something that is used to specify the type. So auto type specifier allows compiler to specify the type of a variable automatically without the need of us to specify the type. This is done based on the initializer. Now here comes the third point. It helps in creating cleaner, shorter and readable code. If we use the auto keyword for variables, then it makes our code cleaner, shorter and readable. Not in every case we should use the auto keyword. We will learn about in what cases we should use the auto keyword. But for now just understand using auto makes the code cleaner, shorter and of course readable. Now through an example program let's understand how to use the auto keyword in our C++ programs. Here I have included the IO stream header file and here I have defined the main function. Within this main function I have defined this variable val one. The type I have specified here is auto. This means this variable has the type auto and the compiler will deduce the type of this variable. This will be deduced based on the initializer. Initializer is 10 of this variable. This value is used to initialize this variable. That's why I'm calling this initializer. compiler will deduce the type of this variable based on this initializer. This initializer has type integer. Therefore, this variable will be of type int or integer. This will be done automatically. Now, if we use stdc out to print the value of val 1, then we will get 10 as the result. we will not get error from the compiler because it is allowed to use the auto as the type specifier for the variable. I hope this is clear to you. So with this we have understood how to use the auto type specifier for a variable. Now let's consider one scenario. Let's say we want to define multiple variables in the same line and we want to define those variables with the auto keyword. Now how do we do this? We can do this like this. Here I have defined these two variables in the same line. The initializers of these two variables are 10 and 2.5. 10 is the integer value and 2.5 is the double value. Now these two variables must have the same type. The base type is auto here. This will be replaced by the compiler automatically based on the initializers of these two variables. Now my question is what will be the type here in place of auto? If you observe these initializers, these initializers have different types. The type of this initializer is integer and the type of this initializer is double. Now, clearly we do not have the same types here. Therefore, deducing the type for these two variables is not that easy. It cannot be done by the compiler. compiler will throw an error in this case because these initializers have different types. The initializers must be of same type if we want to deduce the base type of the variables. So clearly we will get error in this case. So we need to replace either this integer value by a floating point value or a double value to be precise or we need to replace this double value by an integer value. We can replace this 2.5 by an integer value. Let's say we want to replace this with 25. Now we have two integer initializers here. Therefore we will get int here from the compiler. Now the deduction is possible. So in this case there will be no error. And if we try to print the result of val 1 + val 2 we will get 35 as the output. I hope this is clear to you. This is because 10 + 25 is 35. So with this we have learned the significance of the auto. Now we know what is the auto type specifier. We are done with the first topic that is the auto type specifier. Let's move to the second topic where we will understand some important points based on the auto type specifier. Here comes the first point. It requires an initializer. As mentioned already, if we specify the type of a variable as auto, then compiler will deduce the type of that variable for us based on the initializer. Initializer plays a very important role in deducing the type of a variable. If we do not specify the initializer then type deduction is not possible. Therefore it is important to initialize a variable of type auto. I hope this is clear to you. Now here comes the second point. The second point is it is used when type of the initializer is obvious and long. I have mentioned this already. It is not advisable to use auto everywhere. There are some situations where we should use the auto type specifier in place of specifying the type on our own. Here is one such situation. It is mainly used when the type of the initializer is obvious and long. Let's first understand the meaning of obvious with the help of an example. Let's say we have a variable of type integer and we want to use that variable as the initializer for some other variable. Now if it is the case then the type of the variable is quite obvious because we have defined the variable on our own which we want to use as the initializer. Therefore the type of initializer is obvious and hence the type of variable is also obvious. So this is one example where the type of the initializer is obvious. And now let's try to understand the meaning of long. We know typing out int, float, double, care, void are quite simple. We can type them out. They have four or five characters or maybe less. Now this is possible and it is quite easy as well but there are some types which are very long compared to these fundamental types. Typing those data types is quite difficult and it takes a lot of time as well. Sometimes we need to reuse these types in our code. It is not recommended to reuse these types. Instead we can use the auto type specifier. When we learn STL and templates there you will observe many different types which are quite long. There you will understand the significance of the auto type specifier. Autotype specifier is mainly used in those situations when the type is quite obvious and when it is long. I hope this point is making sense to you. For now we have used the fundamental types for auto type specifier. In this lecture I have used the fundamental types to explain the significance of the auto type specifier. But we mainly use it for obvious and long types. Now here comes the third point. The third point is overuse can reduce the readability if type isn't obvious. If the type of a variable cannot be deduced easily then specifying auto for that variable is not recommended because this reduces readability. Now why am I saying this reduces readability? This is because if we specify a variable as auto whose type cannot be deduced easily then it reduces readability as we have to do a lot of work from our side to understand the code. We need to deduce the type from our side every time when we read the code. This reduces the readability of the code. That is why it is not recommended to use auto for those variables where the type deduction is not obvious. That's why I've mentioned before that use auto for those variables where the type of initializer is obvious and long. I hope now it is making complete sense to you. So with this we have learned these three points which are quite important about the auto type specifier and this makes us understand the autotype specifier properly. The significance of autotype specifier will be clear once we discuss templates and STL. There we will use the autotype specifier quite frequently. So with this we have understood the second topic as well that is important points based on the autotype specifier and this means we are done with this topic and this lecture. Okay friends this is it for now. Thank you for watching this lecture. I will see you in the next one. [Applause] [Music]"","

In the previous lecture, we understood basics of input and output. We learned how to perform basic input output operations with the help of std C in, stdc out and std end l. These were the concepts we have understood in the last lecture. Now we are in this lecture and the name of this lecture is type conversion in C++. In this lecture we will understand the concept of type conversion. So without any further delay let's get started with this lecture and let's see what are the topics. The first topic of this lecture is introduction to type conversion. First I will introduce you to type conversion. Then we will move to the next topic where we will understand implicit type conversion and in the third topic we will understand explicit type conversion. So these are all the topics we will cover in this lecture. Let's start with the first topic that is introduction to type conversion. So what is type conversion? Type conversion refers to the process of changing the data type of a value from one type to the other. So it refers to the process of changing the data type of a specific value to some other type. This is what is called type conversion. I hope this is clear to you. Now we can divide type conversion into two categories. We have implicit type conversion and we have explicit type conversion. These are the two types of type conversions we have in C++. Now our goal of this lecture is to understand implicit and explicit type conversion in great details. For now we are done with the introduction to C++ type conversion. This means we are done with this topic. Now let's move to the second topic where we will understand implicit type conversion. So what is implicit type conversion? Implicit type conversion is the type conversion which is done automatically by the compiler. So it is the type of type conversion which is automatically done by the compiler. We do not have to do anything about it. Here the word implicit refers to something which is not stated clearly or something which is done automatically. So implicit type conversion refers to the type conversion which is done automatically by the compiler. I hope this is clear to you. Now let's move to the second point. The second point is it is also known as automatic type conversion for obvious reasons. Now here comes the third point. It usually happens when different data types are mixed in an expression. So implicit type conversion happens in those situations when we have an expression with different data types. Now one thing we need to understand that an expression can only be evaluated by the compiler if in the expression we have consistent data types that is data types must be same. But if we have an expression with different data types then implicit type conversion can come into picture and with the implicit type conversion it will be possible to convert the data types. So that we will be having same data types or consistent data types in an expression. When we have consistent data types in an expression then the expression can be evaluated. So that's the importance of implicit type conversion. This can be done by compiler automatically. I hope this idea is clear to you. If it is not clear, I will make this clear to you with the help of an example. Let's understand this statement through an example program. Here in this example program, I have included the IO stream header file and here I have defined this main function. In this main function, I have defined this variable val 1 of type int. Therefore, this variable can hold an integer value and it is currently holding this value 10. After this we have this variable val 2 of type double and it is holding this double value 5.6. Here I have written this statement double expr= to val 1 + val 2. Here we have this expression val 1 + val 2. In place of val 1 we have 10 and in place of val 2 we have 5.6. So we have an integer value and we have a double value. Clearly in this expression we have different types of values. This expression will be evaluated later and the result will be stored in expr. And here with the help of std see out I'm trying to display this result which is stored in expr but before that I'm also printing this message result colon. So clearly when we execute this program we will get this output result colon 15.6. We are getting the result as 15.6. This means the expression has been evaluated. And we already know that the expression can only be evaluated when we have consistent data types. When the data types are same. Here the data types are different. In this case, there is the possibility that implicit type conversion comes into picture. This means implicit type conversion will be performed by the compiler. Now what happens in case of implicit type conversion? As this is the type conversion, clearly one value out of these two will be converted to some other type. Here we have an integer value and here we have a double value. Either the integer value will be converted to double value or double value will be converted to integer value. In this way we will get consistent data types in this expression and then the expression can be evaluated. Now my question is which value will be converted to the other type? This is decided by the C++ compiler and C++ compiler converts lower data type to higher data type to avoid data loss. So C++ converts lower data type to higher data type. Out of these two, one is the lower data type value. one type will be converted to the other and in this way we will get consistent data type values. So we need to remember this rule that C++ compiler converts on its own lower data type to higher data type and this is mainly done to avoid data loss. You will get to know about why I'm saying that it will avoid data loss in a moment. But for now we need to understand what is the meaning of lower data type and what is the meaning of higher data type and how C++ compiler decides which type is lower and which type is higher. So that's the question how C++ decides lower and higher data types. C++ decides this based on the size or range and precision of the data types. By C++ I mean C++ compiler. I may address C++ compiler as C++. So C++ decides lower data type and higher data type based on the size or range and precision. These are the two parameters. Based on these two we can form this hierarchy of data types. Here we can observe that bold data type is less than any other data type. So clearly it is the lowest data type in this hierarchy. Also we can observe that long double is greater than any other data type. So clearly this is the highest data type in this hierarchy. Now why it is the case? It is because of range or size and precision. So these are the two parameters based on which we can form this hierarchy. Now let's try to understand this properly. Here we have this bool data type. Bool data type has the size of one bite. And with bool data type we can represent only two values. There is no other data type in this list that can represent just two values. So clearly bold data type is less than any other data type. That's why it is first in this hierarchy. So clearly bold data type is the lowest data type. Then comes the car data type. CA data type has the size of one bite but it is still greater than bool data type because it can represent much wider range of values compared to bool. With bool we can represent only two values. With CAD data type we can represent values from 0 to 255 or minus 128 to 127. Clearly it has the wider range. Therefore based on the range car data type is greater than bool data type. What about short? The size of short is two bytes. Clearly it is greater than care based on the size. What about int? Int is greater than short because int is four bytes long. What about long? Long can be four bytes or eight bytes. That depends on the system or we can say the platform. But in general sense we can say long can represent much wider range of values if we compare it with int. If the size of long is four bytes then it is same as int. Therefore it can represent the same number of values as int. But if the size of long is 8 bytes then it can represent much wider range of values. Therefore we can say long is greater than int based on the range. And of course the size as well. Now what about float? We know that size of long can be four bytes or eight bytes. But when we talk about float, size of float must be four bytes only. So it can have only four bytes size. But still I'm saying that float is greater than long. Why is this the case? Here size or range is not playing any role. Precision is playing the role. By precision I mean in this case that float can represent much more precise values compared to long. With long we can only represent integers but with float we can represent real numbers. Much more precise values compared to integer. Therefore the range of float is much wider compared to long. So clearly float is greater than long. That too based on precision. What about double? Double is greater than float because double is of size eight bytes and float is of size four bytes. What about long double? Long double can be 8, 12 or 16 bytes long. If we compare it with double, of course, it is greater than double. So this is the hierarchy that we are getting. Now we know which type is lower and which type is higher. This hierarchy is also called the type promotion hierarchy. Why are we calling this type promotion hierarchy? For this we need to understand the meaning of type promotion. First type promotion refers to the conversion of lower data type to higher data type. It is just like promoting lower data type to higher data type. So there is the promotion of type. That's why we call it type promotion. Now why are we calling this hierarchy type promotion hierarchy? The reason is simple. From this hierarchy we can deduce which type is lower and which type is higher. And we can also understand how the type promotion can happen. Which type will be promoted to the higher data type. We can observe this from this hierarchy. That's why we call this type promotion hierarchy. I hope this is clear to you. Now let's pick one example from here. If we compare int with double, clearly int is the lower data type compared to double. So we can convert int to double or we can promote int to double. But double cannot be converted to int. This will lead to data loss. Why am I saying data loss? Because double can represent much more precise values with decimal point. If we convert it to integer then definitely we will lose data. That is we will lose data after the decimal point. So clearly int can be converted to double but double cannot be converted to int. Now I hope it is clear to you as well that why C++ converts lower data type to higher data type. The reason is simple. It avoids data loss. C++ converts lower data type to higher data type to avoid data loss. Here this integer value will be converted implicitly to double. So it will get converted to its equivalent double value. And now we have two double values. We can add them. This will be evaluated. And this will give us the result 15.6. Now I hope it is clear to you why are we getting this result and not the error. There is implicit type conversion going on behind the scenes. So with this we have understood the concept of implicit type conversion. This means we are done with the second topic also. Now let's move to the third topic where we will understand the explicit type conversion. So what is explicit type conversion? Explicit type conversion is the type conversion which is done manually by the programmer. As the name itself suggests, explicit refers to something that is stated clearly or something which is done manually. So clearly explicit type conversion means a type conversion which is done manually by the program. Now here comes the second point. It is used when we want full control over data type conversion. When we want complete control over the conversion of data type, then we can use explicit type conversion. We have different methods available to do this. We have a total of three different methods that allow us to do explicit type conversion. We have named casts, cast notation, and function notation. Named casts is something that we will understand later in this course. Precisely when we will properly understand inheritance and polymorphism then we will understand the concept of named casts. Named casts will be clear after that. So after discussion of inheritance and polymorphism we will learn named casts. Now we will focus on cast notation and function notation. Let's first understand cast notation. Cast notation is the notation which is followed in C programming language for type conversion. So if you want to do explicit type conversion, we can do with the help of cast notation. It is inherited from C programming language. The second point is it is also called C style type conversion for obvious reasons. Now let's take one example program to see cast notation in action. Here I have included IO stream header file. In this main function I have defined this variable pi of type double and to this I have provided this value 3.14159. Here I'm doing the type conversion. This is the type conversion which is done by me the programmer. This is explicit type conversion. Precisely here I'm following cast notation for converting the type of this value to integer. We know that variable pi is holding this double value. Here in these parenthesis I have provided int. Providing int means I want to convert this value to integer. So double will be converted to integer. Higher data type will be converted to lower data type. Clearly there will be data loss. We will get three only from here. 14159 will be deleted or truncated. We will get value three in this variable approx. And here with the help of stdc out I am printing the value of approx. First approx value of pi will be printed and then the value. So when we execute this program we	will get this output approx value of pi three. I	hope this is clear to you. So this is the cast notation. This is followed in C programming language. Within	parenthesis, we need to specify the data type. Now let's move to the	function notation. Function notation uses function like notation for type conversion. It looks like a function. That's why we call it function like notation or function notation. It	is also called old C++ style type conversion because it is followed in old C++ that is before C++ 11. It is not followed right now in this modern C++. Now through an example program let's understand how to use function notation. Here I'm going to take the same example program which we took in cast notation. Here I have used the cast notation. Now we can replace this with function notation. For this we can remove these parenthesis and we can place parenthesis around pi. Here we	will get this type of notation. You can observe that	this is int and then pi within parenthesis. This is the function notation. You can observe it looks like a function call. That's	why this is called the function notation. Here also we will get the same output because this value will be converted to its equivalent integer form and we will get this output. So with this we have learned the function notation as well. We have learned two different notations for doing type conversion on our own. Now we are done with explicit type conversion. But there is one important point I want you to understand. In modern C++ that is C++ 11 or later the cast notation and function notation are discouraged. We do not use cast notation and function notation in C++	11 or later. That is we do not use these two notations in modern C++ because they lack safety and readability. We will understand why it is the case later	when we discuss named casts. For now, just understand that in modern C++, we do not use cast notation and function notation. So, what's the solution for	explicit	type conversion? What are we left with? We are left with named casts. This is what we will understand in our upcoming lectures. we will understand when we discuss inheritance and polymorphism as I	have	already mentioned this.	So with this we are done	with	explicit type conversion as well and	this	means we are done with this topic and we are	done with this lecture two.	Okay friends, this is it for now. Thank you	for watching	this lecture. I	will see you in the	next one. [Applause] [Music]"",,""Hello everyone, welcome to NESO Academy. In the previous lecture, we understood basics of input and output. We learned how to perform basic input output operations with the help of std C in, stdc out and std end l. These were the concepts we have understood in the last lecture. Now we are in this lecture and the name of this lecture is type conversion in C++. In this lecture we will understand the concept of type conversion. So without any further delay let's get started with this lecture and let's see what are the topics. The first topic of this lecture is introduction to type conversion. First I will introduce you to type conversion. Then we will move to the next topic where we will understand implicit type conversion and in the third topic we will understand explicit type conversion. So these are all the topics we will cover in this lecture. Let's start with the first topic that is introduction to type conversion. So what is type conversion? Type conversion refers to the process of changing the data type of a value from one type to the other. So it refers to the process of changing the data type of a specific value to some other type. This is what is called type conversion. I hope this is clear to you. Now we can divide type conversion into two categories. We have implicit type conversion and we have explicit type conversion. These are the two types of type conversions we have in C++. Now our goal of this lecture is to understand implicit and explicit type conversion in great details. For now we are done with the introduction to C++ type conversion. This means we are done with this topic. Now let's move to the second topic where we will understand implicit type conversion. So what is implicit type conversion? Implicit type conversion is the type conversion which is done automatically by the compiler. So it is the type of type conversion which is automatically done by the compiler. We do not have to do anything about it. Here the word implicit refers to something which is not stated clearly or something which is done automatically. So implicit type conversion refers to the type conversion which is done automatically by the compiler. I hope this is clear to you. Now let's move to the second point. The second point is it is also known as automatic type conversion for obvious reasons. Now here comes the third point. It usually happens when different data types are mixed in an expression. So implicit type conversion happens in those situations when we have an expression with different data types. Now one thing we need to understand that an expression can only be evaluated by the compiler if in the expression we have consistent data types that is data types must be same. But if we have an expression with different data types then implicit type conversion can come into picture and with the implicit type conversion it will be possible to convert the data types. So that we will be having same data types or consistent data types in an expression. When we have consistent data types in an expression then the expression can be evaluated. So that's the importance of implicit type conversion. This can be done by compiler automatically. I hope this idea is clear to you. If it is not clear, I will make this clear to you with the help of an example. Let's understand this statement through an example program. Here in this example program, I have included the IO stream header file and here I have defined this main function. In this main function, I have defined this variable val 1 of type int. Therefore, this variable can hold an integer value and it is currently holding this value 10. After this we have this variable val 2 of type double and it is holding this double value 5.6. Here I have written this statement double expr= to val 1 + val 2. Here we have this expression val 1 + val 2. In place of val 1 we have 10 and in place of val 2 we have 5.6. So we have an integer value and we have a double value. Clearly in this expression we have different types of values. This expression will be evaluated later and the result will be stored in expr. And here with the help of std see out I'm trying to display this result which is stored in expr but before that I'm also printing this message result colon. So clearly when we execute this program we will get this output result colon 15.6. We are getting the result as 15.6. This means the expression has been evaluated. And we already know that the expression can only be evaluated when we have consistent data types. When the data types are same. Here the data types are different. In this case, there is the possibility that implicit type conversion comes into picture. This means implicit type conversion will be performed by the compiler. Now what happens in case of implicit type conversion? As this is the type conversion, clearly one value out of these two will be converted to some other type. Here we have an integer value and here we have a double value. Either the integer value will be converted to double value or double value will be converted to integer value. In this way we will get consistent data types in this expression and then the expression can be evaluated. Now my question is which value will be converted to the other type? This is decided by the C++ compiler and C++ compiler converts lower data type to higher data type to avoid data loss. So C++ converts lower data type to higher data type. Out of these two, one is the lower data type value. one type will be converted to the other and in this way we will get consistent data type values. So we need to remember this rule that C++ compiler converts on its own lower data type to higher data type and this is mainly done to avoid data loss. You will get to know about why I'm saying that it will avoid data loss in a moment. But for now we need to understand what is the meaning of lower data type and what is the meaning of higher data type and how C++ compiler decides which type is lower and which type is higher. So that's the question how C++ decides lower and higher data types. C++ decides this based on the size or range and precision of the data types. By C++ I mean C++ compiler. I may address C++ compiler as C++. So C++ decides lower data type and higher data type based on the size or range and precision. These are the two parameters.

Long can be four bytes or eight bytes. That depends on the system or we can say the platform. But in general sense we can say long can represent much wider range of values if we compare it with int. If the size of long is four bytes then it is same as int. Therefore it can represent the same number of values as int. But if the size of long is 8 bytes then it can represent much wider range of values. Therefore we can say long is greater than int based on the range. And of course the size as well. Now what about float? We know that size of long can be four bytes or eight bytes. But when we talk about float, size of float must be four bytes only. So it can have only four bytes size. But still I'm saying that float is greater than long. Why is this the case? Here size or range is not playing any role. Precision is playing the role. By precision I mean in this case that float can represent much more precise values compared to long. With long we can only represent integers but with float we can represent real numbers.

Let's find out. Keywords are reserved words. This means they are built-in words and they have special meaning and purpose in C++. This means we cannot use them as variable names. For example, int, float, return, while, class are all examples of keywords. They have special meaning and purpose in C++ and we cannot use them as variable names. Now what about identifiers? Identifiers are userdefined words. This means they are defined by user and we can use them to name variables. For example, here I've defined this variable marks of type int. This is the identifier of this variable because this helps identify this variable and the type here int represents the keyword. So it is clearly helping us defining this variable. So this is how we can define a variable and this is the identifier of this variable. Now I want you to remember this one thing. Keywords are built-in words and identifiers are userdefined words.

In the previous lecture, we understood basics of IO stream. We understood the difference between IO stream as the library and IO stream as the header file. Now we are in this lecture and the name of this lecture is basic input and output. In this lecture we will understand what is input and output and how we can perform input and output operations. So without any further delay, let's get started with this lecture and let's see what are the topics. The first topic of this lecture is stdc out. First we will understand what is stdc out in C++ and how we can use it. Then we will move to the next topic where we will understand std and l. After understanding std and l we will move to the last topic where we will understand std c. So there are a total of three topics in this lecture which we need to deal with. Let's get started with the first topic that is stdc out. So what is stdc out? STDC out stands for standard character output. STD came from standard C came from character and out came from output. So this represents standard character output. It is used to display data as the sequence of characters to the console. With the help of std seeout, we can display some data as the sequence of characters to the console window. We know what is the console window. When we execute our program in C++, then we will get the console window which is the black screen as the result. In the black screen, we would be able to see the output of our programs. So this is what the console window is. With the help of std seeout, we can display data over there. The third point is it is included in IO stream header file. We know this already. The declaration of std see out is available in IO stream header file. We need to include this header file in order to use std out. I hope this is clear to you. Now let's take one example to help us understand how to use std out in C++. Here is the example program. I have included the IO stream header file because I'm going to use stdcout in this program. Here we have this main function and within this main function we have this line std see out then these two less than symbols then 42 with the help of this line 42 will be displayed on the screen but not as an integer but as the sequence of characters this is what I've mentioned here 42 is converted to a sequence of characters 4 and two although it is an integer But it will be displayed as the sequence of characters. This is what I have mentioned here. The data is always displayed as the sequence of characters to the console. Apart from this, we need to understand the meaning of this specific operator. We have two less than symbols here. This represents an operator. Precisely. This is called the insertion operator. Why it is called the insertion operator? Because with the help of this operator, we insert the value on the right hand side to the left hand side. We are inserting this value to std see out. This will help us display this value on the screen. Because std see out represents the console window. I hope this is clear to you. What is the meaning of this insertion operator? It is the combination of these two less than symbols. And you can observe the direction is from right to left because we are inserting value of the right hand side to the left hand side. That is why this operator makes sense. So we have two less than symbols here. This is what we need to remember. Now when we execute this program, we will get this output 42 on the console window. But this is not the integer. This is equivalent to the sequence of characters 4 and 2. I hope this idea is clear to you. What is std out and how we can use it in our C++ programs. Now let's say that this value represents the age of some person and we want to indicate this to the user that is we want to display some message on the screen that indicates the user that this value represents the age of some person for this purpose I want to display let's say age is 42 in order to display this message we can use insertion operator twice And this means we can chain insertion operator like this. Here I have used this insertion operator twice. This insertion operator allows us to insert this specific string to std see out. And this insertion operator allows us to display this value on the screen. That is it allows us to insert this value in std out. So when we execute this program we will get this output age is 42. First this string is provided to stdc out with the help of insertion operator. That's why we are seeing age is then 42 is provided. We will get 42 on the screen. So we are getting this message age is 42. Now the output is more clear to us. So in this way if we want to display such kind of an output we can use insertion operator like this. Now let's say we want to store this value in some variable and in place of this value we want to use that variable. We can do this as well. We can store this value in the variable called age. This is the name that I have provided from my side. I have initialized this variable to value 42. This variable is of type int. It can hold this value. Now here in place of value 42, I'm using this variable age. This will display the same output. Age is 42. I hope the idea is completely clear to you how we can use std out in our C++ programs. So with this we are done with the first topic that is std out. Now let's move to the second topic where we will understand STD and L. So what is STD and L and why is it useful? In order to understand STD and L and its importance, let me ask you this question. What is the output of the following program? Let's say this is the program and we want to determine the output of this program. Pause for 10 seconds. Take your time and try to answer this question on your own. So what do you think? What is the output of this program? I hope you have solved this problem and you got the output as well. So what's the output? You might be thinking that hello must be displayed in one line and I am a teacher in the next line because this is how the format looks like in the program as well. We have these two statements in separate lines. Hello must be displayed in the first line and I'm a teacher in the second line. But this is not how C++ works in reality. When we execute this program, we will get this output. Hello, I am a teacher in the same line. You might get surprised by this output but this is the output we get. Now why is this the case? The reason is pretty simple here. We are not explicitly telling the C++ that we want a new line after hello. We want to display I am a teacher in the new line. But we are not telling this to the C++. That's why we are getting hello I am a teacher in the same line. We can tell this explicitly by using std end l. We need to specify std end l at the end of this see out statement. We need to specify something like this. Here we need to provide the insertion operator and after this std end l. This will be provided to std see out and it tells we need a new line. After displaying hello, new line will be displayed and therefore I am a teacher will be displayed in the next line. So when we execute this program, we will get this output. Hello, I am a teacher in their respective lines. So this is the output we are getting in the same format we have here in our program. I hope this concept is clear to you. We need to explicitly tell C++ that we need a new line and we can do this with the help of std and l. This object is also available in IO stream. So we need to include IO stream no matter what. So with this we have understood the second topic also that is std and l. Now let's move to the third topic where we will understand std CN. So what is stdc inn? As the name suggests stdcin stands for standard character input. std came from standard C came from character and in came from input. So in represents input. There we had out. Out represents output. In represents input. It is used to read input from the keyboard. STDC in is helpful in reading input from the keyboard. So if we want to receive input from the user that too with the help of the keyboard then we can use stdc in. Now here comes the third point. It works with the extraction operator to put the data in a variable. In case of stdc in we have the extraction operator. If you remember in case of stdc out we have the insertion operator. In this case we have the extraction operator because we want to extract input from the user and we want to place it somewhere in some variable. We have this extraction operator which is the combination of these two greater than symbols. So I hope this is clear to you. It works with the extraction operator to put the data that we receive from the user in a variable. That's the third point. Now, here is the fourth point. It is included in IO stream header file. Just like std see out and std end L, it is also included in IO stream header file. Now, here is a simple example to demonstrate std C in C++. This is how we can use stdcn. I have included the io stream header file correctly and here I have defined this main function. Within this main function I have defined this variable age and I have initialized it to zero. These empty braces indicate that this variable has been initialized to zero. Now after this I have written this line std c in then the extraction operator and then the variable age. Through this extraction operator, we can receive input from the user and we can put that input in this variable age. I'm assuming that user will provide the age of some person. We will receive that age in this age variable because of this line. I hope this is clear to you. After this, with the help of std out, we will get the message on the screen. you entered a specific age. Now when we execute this program, we will see the console window. There we can provide the input. Let's say we have provided this input 40. When we hit enter, we will get the output you entered 40. We are getting the correct output here. This output clearly tells us that the age variable has received the value 40. And this is the reason why we have 40 in place of age variable here. That's why we are getting this output. You entered 40. I hope this is clear to you. So with this we learned how to use stdc in to receive a specific input from the user. This is just one input. What if we want to receive multiple inputs? We can chain extraction operator for this purpose. Let's say we want to receive the gender from the user as well. Then we can chain this extraction operator like this. Here I have defined this variable gender. I have initialized it to zero. Then here you can observe that I have changed the extraction operator to receive more than one inputs precisely two inputs. I want to receive age and gender of the user. Here we will receive age and here we will receive the gender from the user. After this with the help of this statement we would be able to display this message age colon the specific age. Then we will get the new line and then in the next line we will get gender colon the specific gender. Now when we execute this program we will again see the console window and let's say the inputs we provide is 30 and m. These are the inputs we have provided 30 and m. 30 will be received in the variable age and m will be received in the variable gender. After hitting enter we will see this output age col 30 and gender colon m. You can observe the correct output. In place of the variable age, we have this value 30. And in place of this variable gender, we have capital M. This means our program is working correctly. And this shows how we can receive multiple inputs from the user. So with this we have learned the std C in properly and this means we are done with the third topic as well. And this clearly means we are done with this lecture. Okay friends, this is it for now. Thank you for watching this lecture. I will see you in the next one. [Applause] [Music]"","

Let's find out. Pamdas tells the order of evaluation of arithmetic operators. How arithmetic operators will be evaluated is decided by the Pamdas rule. In Pamas, P stands for parenthesis, E for exponents, M for multiplication, D for division, A for addition and S for subtraction. The order of evaluation is from top to bottom. First parenthesis will be resolved then exponents then multiplication and so on. Now let's take an example. Let's say we want to print the result of this expression 5 + 2 * 3^2. We know first parenthesis needs to be resolved but these parentheses are not part of the expression. They are part of the print function. So we need to proceed further and evaluate the exponent. Here we have 3^ 2. 3^2 is same as 9. So we'll get 9 here. Then we need to perform multiplication. 9 * 2 is 18. Then addition comes 18 + 5 gives 23. So the output is 23. It is as simple as that. So this is the significance of the pandas rule in Python. Want to learn Python? Follow our Python programming course."","

In the previous lecture, we understood the fundamental data types in C++. Now we are in this lecture and the name of this lecture is basics of IO stream. From this lecture onwards we will understand basic input output operations that is we will learn how to perform basic input output operations in C++. But in order to understand how to perform these operations, first we need to clear our basics about the IO stream. This lecture is dedicated to understand basics of IO stream. So without any further delay, let's get started with this lecture and let's see what are the topics. There is only one topic of this lecture and the name of the topic is basics of IO stream. So let's proceed further and let's understand what is an IO stream. IO stream is the name of both the library and the header file. The goal of this lecture is to understand the difference between these two. First we will understand what is IO stream as the library. For this first we need to understand what is a library in general sense. So what is a library in C++? A library is a collection of pre-written code usually written by experts. So think of a library as the collection of pre-written code which is already written by someone for us. We do not have to write the code. We can directly use the code whenever we need to. For example, let's say we want to use stdc out. We can use stdcout directly without worrying about how it works behind the scenes. We already have used stdcout to print something on the screen. We used it because the code of std out is already written for us. We do not define the code for std out. There is no need to reinvent the wheel. we directly use std out in our code to print something on the screen. So the code of std seeout is already written by some expert. Similarly, there are other objects as well. For those objects also the code is already written. We can directly use those objects. The collection of all those pre-written codes is what we call a library. I hope this idea is clear to you. If it is not clear then let me clear this concept with the help of an analogy. Think of a library as a toolbox which is the collection of various tools. If we want we can use a tool directly. There is no need to reinvent the wheel. That is there is no need to build these tools from scratch. For example, if we want to use a hammer then we can directly use hammer for a specific purpose. There is no need to build the hammer from scratch. So hammer could be thought of as the pre-written code and the library is the toolbox which has all the pre-written code or all the tools for the purpose of performing some operations. I hope the concept is now completely clear. What is the meaning of a library? Now let's move to the second point. The second point is standard C++ library has many libraries including IO stream. There is one big library called standard C++ library which is available to us. This library is the collection of many different libraries and one such library is the IO stream library. IO stream has tools to perform input and output operations. IO stream is the library which is the collection of tools that allows us to perform operations such as input and output. So with the help of IO stream library, we can perform input and output operations. Here I stands for input, O stands for output and stream means a sequence of characters to read or write. So with the help of IO stream we can use the tools which are input output tools that allow us to read or write characters. I hope this idea is clear to you. So this is the meaning of IO stream library. It is the collection of input output tools which we can use in our code. We do not have to invent those tools. One such tool is stdc out. The other tool is stdc in. We have other tools available as well in this IO stream library. Now we know what is the meaning of ioam library. Let's now understand what is IO stream header file. In order to understand IO stream as the header file, we first need to understand what is a header file. So what is a header file? A header file is a file with declaration of tools. So you can think of a header file as the file which contains many declarations of the tools of a specific library. Now you might be thinking why do we need a header file when we already have library? library has all the code which we can use. Then what is the concept of header file and why do we need it? There is one simple reason why we need header files and I would like to explain that. Header files are needed to avoid errors from the compiler. You know this already if you want to use a specific code then you need to define that code first. Let's say you want to use std out in your code. But the definition of the std see out is not available in your code. It is available in the IO stream library. Now how compiler knows that this specific code is available in the IO stream library. You are simply using stdc out in the code. The definition of that code is not available. So how do we use stdc out? Compiler will generate an error in this case because std out is not defined in the current code. It is not defined in the code which you have written. So this is the reason why we need header files. Through header files we declare the tools which we want to use. So there is one header file called IO stream header file. If we want to use the std see out tool then we need to include the IO stream header file because it has the declaration of std seout with the declaration. We tell the compiler that this tool is available in the IO stream library. So please compile my code and do not produce any error. So if we want to use tools like stdc out, stdc in then we need to include IO stream header file. If we want to use other tools then we need to include the appropriate header files before using those tools because those tools are not defined in the code we write. They are defined in the libraries which are already written. I hope the idea is clear to you. So with this we guarantee the compiler that the tools are available. Don't worry at all. Now here is the second point. IO stream header file allows accessing the input output tools defined in the IO stream library. In the IO stream library we have input output tools. If we want to use these tools then we need to include ioam header file. This is what I have mentioned already. Now how do we include ioam header file? We can include ioam header file in our code by writing this line of code #incclude io stream. Through this command we tell the specific preprocessor to include the IO stream header file in our code so that compiler will not generate error if we try to use the input output tools in our program. So with this I hope it is clear what is the importance of IO stream header file and I hope with this it is also clear what is the difference between IO stream library and IO stream header file. IO library has all the input output tools. This means it has the definition of the input output tools. IO stream header file has the declarations of the input output tools. we need to include IO stream header file if we want to use the tools which are available in the IO stream library. So with this we have understood the basics of IO stream and this means we are done with this topic and we are also done with this lecture. Okay friends, this is it for now. Thank you for watching this presentation. I will see you in the next one. [Applause] [Music]"","

Let's find out. C++ is a statically typed language which means type is known at compile time. And this means the type information of a variable is known to the compiler at compilation time. This means if we define a variable of a specific type, we cannot assign a different kind of value to it. For example, here I have defined this variable age of type integer. Therefore, this variable can hold an integer value. But if we try to assign a different kind of value, let's say a string to this variable, then we will get error from the compiler. We are getting error from the compiler because compiler already knows the type of this variable. This variable is of type integer. Therefore, it can only hold an integer value. If we try to assign a different kind of value to it, then compiler will throw an error. Now let's discuss some advantages and disadvantages of C++ being statically typed. The obvious advantage is early error detection. Type related errors are caught at the time of compilation itself. This leads to early error detection. We do not have to wait till the program runs. Now here comes the second advantage. Faster performance. Type checking is done at the compilation itself. Therefore at runtime there is less overhead of checking the type. Hence this leads to faster performance. Now apart from these advantages we have a disadvantage of C++ being statically typed and it is less flexibility for dynamic behavior. C++ is less flexible because once the variable is defined of a specific type, it can only hold that type of value. We cannot assign a different kind of value to it. So there is no dynamic behavior. So these are some of the advantages and disadvantages. And now we know that C++ is a statically typed language. Want to learn C++? Follow our C++ programming course."","

In the previous lectures, we understood the basics of data types. The last lecture was about finding the range of integer data type. Now we are in this lecture and the name of this lecture is fundamental data types. In this lecture, we will understand some of the fundamental data types available in C++. So without any further delay, let's get started with this lecture and let's see what are the topics. The first topic of this lecture is introduction to data types. First I will introduce you to data types. I will explain what are the different data types we have. Then we will move to the next topic where we will understand fundamental data types in great details. So these are the two topics we have in this lecture. Let's get started with the first topic that is introduction to data types. So what is a data type? We already know this that a data type tells the type and size of data a variable can hold. So with data type we can tell the type and size of data a variable is capable of holding. That's what data type is. We learned about data type already. Now let's understand what are the different data types we have in C++. We have fundamental data types. Fundamental data types are built-in data types. That is these data types are predefined. We do not have to define these data types. And they also set the core of other data types like classes, enums, pointers, arrays etc. That is why they are called fundamental data types. Under fundamental data types we have int, car, float, double, bool and void. These are all the fundamental data types. We will discuss these data types in details in the next topic. For now just understand these are the fundamental data types we have. Then we have userdefined data types. These are the data types which are defined by user or programmer as the name suggests. Under this category we have strct, class, enum and union. Then we have derived data types. Derived data types are those data types which are derived from fundamental data types. That's why they are called derived data types. Now under this category we have arrays, pointers, functions and references. So you can observe these are the different data types we have and the focus of this lecture is on fundamental data types as already mentioned. So we will understand these data types in the next topic. For now we are done with the introduction to data types. Now let's move to the second topic where we will understand fundamental data types in great details. Here is the first fundamental data type int. int is used to represent integers. We already know this that int is helpful in representing an integer. Here is the size of int. Size of int is four bytes that is 32 bits. And with the help of int we can have this range min - 2147483648 to + 2147483647. This is the range we have obtained from this formula. This formula we have already studied in the last lecture. In the last lecture I explained how to find the range of an integer type. Especially for signed integer type we have this range -2 power n -1 to + 2 power n -1 -1. We also learned how to find the unsigned range. We have 0 to 2 power n -1 as the unsigned range. By default int data type is signed. That's why we have this signed range. By signed I mean we would be able to represent both positive and negative values. Here we are representing both positive and negative values. Here we need to use this formula. We need to replace n by 32 here and here and then we will get this specific range. I hope this is clear to you. So with this we learned this int data type but this is not the only data type we have to represent an integer. We have other integer types as well. Now let's discuss them one by one through this table. Here in this table I will list down the types. Then I will provide the sizes of each type and I will also provide the range of each type. Here is the first type short int. The size of short int is 2 bytes and therefore the range is - 32768 to 32767. We can use the same formula here. Now we need to replace n by 16 because we have two bytes as the size for short int. Two bytes is same as 16 bits. That's why we need to replace n by 16 here and here to get this range. Again, short int is also signed by default. That's why we are using this formula. I hope this is clear to you. Now, here comes the second type. The second type is int. We learned already what int is. int has four bytes of size and range is minus 2147483648 to 2147483647. We can use the same formula. Then comes the long int type. Long int type has size of four bytes or 8 bytes. That depends on the platform and the compiler. In 32-bit systems, long int has the four byte size. This is fixed. But in 64-bit systems it can be four bytes or 8 bytes. That depends on the platform. Mostly on Windows machine long int has the four bytes size. On Unix based machines it is of 8 bytes. I hope this is clear to you. If we are considering four bytes long int then the range must be same as the int data type. I hope this is clear to you. Again this is also representing signed long int. Now here comes the fourth data type that is long long int. Long long int has the fixed size of 8 bytes. 8 bytes is same as 64 bits. If we replace 64 here and here, we will get this range - 2^ 63 to + 2^ 63 - 1. 2^ 63 will give us a very big value. I hope it is clear to you. So these are the four integer data types we have. Precisely these are signed integer types. That's why we have these signed ranges. We can also represent them in unsigned form. That is we can have unsigned versions of these types. This means we have four more data types which are associated with integers. We have unsigned short int. We just need to specify the unsigned keyword to tell that we want to represent only positive numbers. Unsigned short int has the same size of two bytes and the range is 0 to 65,535. We can get this range by using the formula 0 to 2 power n -1. We can replace n by 16. We will get 2^ 16. 2^ 16 is same as 65,536. Then we need to subtract one from it to obtain 65,535 here. So we will get this range 0 to 65,535. As mentioned already, this is the unsigned type. Therefore, we can only represent positive values with it. Now let's move to the other type. The next type. The next type is unsigned int. Unsigned int has the same size as int but it can represent only unsigned values that is positive values. Size is four bytes and range is 0 to 429496 7295. I obtained this range by using the same formula. Now here comes the next type that is unsigned long int. Unsigned long int can be four bytes or eight bytes. If we are considering four byte unsigned long int, then the range must be same as unsigned int which is 0 to 429496 7295. Last but not the least we have unsigned long long int. Size of it is same as the long long int which is 8 bytes. But the range is of course different. Here we will have 0 to two power 64 minus1. I hope this is clear to you. So with this we have learned different integer types we have in C++. Now let's take one simple example of the integer variable. Here I have defined this integer variable. This variable name is I and the type here is int. We can specify any other type which is of integer. And here I have provided this value 2147483 647. This is the maximum possible value we can provide to this variable. As you can observe this here we can provide the minimum possible value. If you want we can provide minus 2147483648. This variable is of type int. Therefore it can hold these values. So with this I hope it is clear to you what is the int data type. What are the different integer types we have? Now let's move to the second fundamental data type which is the car data type. Car data type is used to represent characters enclosed within single quotes. We know what a character is. A character is a single character which can be enclosed within single quotes. Size of CAD data type is one byte that is 8 bits and its range is - 128 to 127. If we are considering signed care. If we are considering unsigned care then the range must be 0 to 255. Now you might be wondering why are we having integer ranges here? The reason is clear. We know that internal representation of a character is integer. So we can think of car data type as another integer type. This is just another integer type. That's why we can specify these integer ranges. CA data type has the size of one byte that is 8 bits. With eight bits we can have these ranges. If we have the car data type then it is possible to store integers in this range. If let's say we have unsigned care then the range is 0 to 255. So we can represent these positive values if we want. So it is possible to directly store an integer in a character type variable. I hope this idea is clear to you. We can store a character if we want. that character will be translated to an integer. We know each character has an integer equivalent. You can search online for an ASKI table and there you will find all the characters written and their integer equivalents. So this is something I want to clear. I want to mention one more important point that it is not the case that by default care data type is signed. It depends on the compiler. It may be possible that one compiler has the signed care as the default and the other compiler has the unsigned care as the default. If you want, we can impose signed care or unsigned care by specifying the keyword signed or unsigned before the care data type. I hope this idea is clear. Now let's take one example of the character variable. Here I have defined this variable C of type care and to this variable I have provided this specific character capital P. This will eventually be translated to its integer equivalent. I want you to find out what is the integer equivalent of capital P by looking at the ASKI table. You can search online for the ASI table as S C I. I hope this is clear to you. I really want you to post your answers in the comment section. What is the integer equivalent of capital P. Now we are done with the second data type also. Let's move to the third fundamental data type which is the float data type. Float data type is used to represent a floating point number with precision up to seven decimal digits. So with the help of float data type it is possible to represent a floating point number that is a number with the decimal point and it provides the precision up to seven decimal digits. So if we have a number with seven decimal digits that is seven digits after the decimal point and if we try to store the value in the variable then that value will be intact it will not change. This means after the decimal point seven decimal digits will not change. But let's say we have more than seven digits then after the seventh digit it is possible that we may lose precision. We may not get those same values. This is the meaning of precision. I hope this is clear to you. So with float we get seven decimal digits precision. Here is the size of the float data type. It has four bytes size that is 32 bits. And the range is mentioned here. Range of the flow data type is 1.17549 E - 38 to 3.4282 E + 38. We already know the meaning of E - 38 and E + 38. This is same as 1.17549 * 10 ^ - 38 and this is same as 3.4282 * 10 ^ 38. I hope this is clear to you. This is the range of positive values. We can provide the range of negative values as well by placing minus sign in front of these two values. So we'll get this range - 1.17549 EUS 38 to -3.40282 E + 38. So these are the ranges we get for the float type. I hope this is clear to you. Now you might be wondering how do we get this range? How can we calculate these ranges? We know how to calculate the range of an int type that is integer type. But how can we calculate the range of the float type? This is out of the scope of this C++ course. Understand that calculating the range of the float type or double type which we will discuss later is out of the scope of this C++ course because it is usually taught in computer organization and architecture subject. There you will understand all about the floatingoint numbers the ILE E 754 standard and there you will understand how a floatingoint number is represented. You will also learn about how to calculate the range of floatingoint numbers. So floatingoint numbers can be well understood in the computer organization and architecture subject. Here we just need to see this what is the range of the float type. We do not have to worry about how these ranges we can get. I hope this is clear to you. Now let's take one example of the float variable. Here I have defined this float variable f and to this I have provided this value 6.53 f. This is the float lit. Now we know what is the float data type. Let's move to the fourth data type which is the double data type. Double data type is used to represent a floating point number with precision up to 15 decimal digits. Here we get 15 decimal digits precision which is twice as much of the float. Here you can observe we get the precision up to seven decimal digits. Here we get the precision up to 15 decimal digits. So if we have a floatingoint number with 15 decimal digits then we will get those 15 decimal digits as it is. I hope this is clear to you. Now let's see what is the size of the double. Size of double is 8 bytes which is double the size of the float. You can observe this. That's why the name double. I hope this is clear to you. We get the double precision because we have double the size. Now what's the range? Range is 2.2507 E minus 308 to 1.79769 E + 308. Range is very big compared to float. This is what you can observe. This is the range of positive values. For negative values, we need to place minus sign in front of these two values. We will get this range. Now here is a simple example. I have defined this variable of type double. The name of this variable is D and the value I have provided is 56E - 5. I can store this value. So this is the double type. I hope	this type is also clear to you. Up to this point	we have studied four fundamental data types. Now let's move to the fifth fundamental data type which is the	bold type. Bold type represents truth values true and false. So with	the help of bold type it is possible to represent only two values that is true and false. Size of bool type is one by that is eight bits but it can only represent two values that is	true and false. And here is the example of the bool type variable. I have defined this variable of type bool and I provide true to it. I can also provide false if I want to. One thing we need to note that bool type is used mainly for conditionals and loops. We will learn about conditionals and loops later. There you will understand the significance of the bool type. Now let's move to the sixth fundamental data type which is the void data type. Void indicates absence of data or	no value. So it represents some emptiness or absence	of data. We do not use it to define a variable. No variable can have a void type because it does not make sense. A variable must	hold some value. We cannot define a variable as void. But we can use void data type in other scenarios. We can use it for functions if we want. We can specify the return type as void of a function to indicate that function will not return anything. That is it will not produce any output but it may perform some action. For example, here I have defined this function fun and the return type of this function is void. This means this function will not return any value. This is one use case of the void data type. There are other use cases as well. We will study about them	later. We mainly use void data type for functions and pointers. We will learn about pointers as well. So with this we have understood six fundamental data	types in C++. We learned about int, car, float, double, bool and void. These are the fundamental data types. Now we are done with the second topic also.	And this	means we are done with this lecture. Okay friends, this is it for now. Thank you for watching this lecture. I will see you in the next one.

In case of normal division, we will get 3.5 and in case of low division we will get three. We are getting 3.5 in case of normal division which is the exact value. But in case of low division 0.5 is truncated and we are left with integer value three. Now what happens if we replace 7 by minus 7 in these two expressions. What do you think? What is the output in this case? In this case we will get -3.5 for normal division and minus4 for flow division. -3.5 is expected but minus4 is not expected. We were expecting minus3. we are getting minus4 because flow division always goes down to the nearest integer. When we divide -7 by 2, we get -3.5. Now if we go down to the nearest integer, we will get -4, not minus3. So that's the difference between normal division and flow division. Want to learn Python?

In the previous lecture, we learned why we need data types in C++. Now we are in this lecture and the name of this lecture is range of integers. In this lecture, we will understand how to derive the formula to calculate the range of integers. Now you might be wondering why do we need this lecture? In the next lecture we will understand fundamental data types in C++. There you will understand that different data types have different range that is they have different range of values. Now the obvious question is how to calculate the range of values. This is why this lecture is here. In this lecture we will understand how to derive the formula to calculate the range of integers specifically. So without any further delay, let's get started with this lecture and let's see what are the topics. There is only one topic and the name of the topic is range of integers. Now let's proceed further and let's understand how to derive the formula to calculate the range of integers. In order to derive the formula to calculate the range of integers, we will consider the integer data type of size three bits. So this is my consideration. Consider an integer data type whose size is three bits. Obviously in reality integer data type is not of three bits. I am considering this for the sake of simplification in calculation. We need to derive the formula. So we need to consider a very simple example to derive the formula. I'm considering the data type that is integer data type of size three bits. Now let's consider the different possible combinations of binary numbers that we get from three bits. The possible combinations are 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 and 1 1. These are all the possible combinations of three bits. So this is what we are getting as the result of possible combinations. Now let's assume that these binary numbers are representing only positive integers. So 0 0 0 is same as 0. 0 1 is same as 1. 0 1 0 is same as 2. Then we have 3 4 5 6 7 in the same way. So we are getting this range of positive integers from these binary numbers. We are getting 0 to 7 as the range. 0 is the least possible value in this range and 7 is the maximum possible value. So now we got the range of positive integers and you might be wondering how I got these values. Let's find this out. For this we need to consider the positional weights of these bits. The positional weight of this bit is one. The positional weight of this bit is two. And the positional weight of this bit is four. These are the positional weights. Now we can easily calculate these values. We need to multiply each bit by its positional weight. After getting all the multiplications, we need to add them to obtain the final result. For example, let's say we want to find what is the equivalent integer value of 11 1. We need to multiply 1 by 4. We will get four. Then we need to multiply 2 by 1 we will get two. Then we need to multiply 1 by 0 we will get 0. Now we need to add all these multiplications. We will get 4 + 2 + 0 which is equal to 6. In the same way 1 1 1 will give us 7 because it is 4 + 2 + 1 4 + 2 + 1 will give us 7. So in this way we get the integer equivalents of these binary numbers. I hope this is clear to you. Now let's assume that these binary numbers are representing both positive and negative values. If that's the case then the first bit of these binary numbers must represent the sign bit. Here zero represents the positive number and one represents the negative number. Also the positional weight here must be minus 4. This is true for both positive and negative numbers. Now let's write the integer equivalents. It is quite simple to write. For these four binary numbers, we will get the same numbers here. as integer equivalents we will get 0 1 2 3. What about this binary number? Now the positional weight is minus4. We need to multiply -4 by 1. So from this binary number we will get -4 as the result. What about this binary number here? We know we need to multiply minus4 by 1. We will get -4. Then we need to multiply 1 by 1. We will get one. Now we need to add these two -4 + 1 will give us -3. So this is the integer equivalent of this binary number 101. In the same way we will get the rest of the values as well -2 and minus1. So now we got the range for both positive and negative integers. The range is from -4 to + 3. -4 is the least possible value here and 3 is the maximum possible value. So now we know that if we consider only positive values then the range is 0 to 7. This is the range we are getting for a threebit data type. We chose this number to make the calculations as simple as possible. Now we need to generalize this. We need to derive the formula from here so that we can calculate the range for any number of bits. Now what we should do in this case? We know that with three bits we got two power three possible combinations. We can represent 7 in terms of 2^ 3. We can write it as 2^ 3 - 1. 2^ 3 will give us 8 and 8 - 1 is 7. So we will get 7 from here. Now it is clear that the range must be 0 to 2^ 3 -1. And what happens in case of n bits? If we have n number of bits then the range must be 0 to 2 power n minus one. So this is the formula we are getting 0 to 2^ n -1. I hope this is clear to you. So we got the formula to calculate the range of positive values. Now what if we consider both positive and negative values? If we consider both positive and negative values especially in case of three bits then we know the range is -4 to + 3. Again we need to represent these values in terms of 2^ 3. We can do this -4 could be represented as -2 power 3 -1 3 -1 is in the power we will get -2 power 3 -1 3 - 1 is same as 2 we will get -2 power 2 - 2^2 will give us -4 so we will get -4 and what about this 3 we know that 2^ 3 - 1 where 3 - 1 is in the power will give us 4. From four we can subtract 1. So here we must have 2^ 3 - 1 - 1. This is true for three bits. Now what about n bits? For n bits we will get this range - 2^ nus1 2 + 2^ n minus one -1. This is the range we are getting for both positive and negative values. You can verify this on your own why this is matching with this range. You can replace n by3 and you will get this range. So we got the formula for both positive and negative values as well. So this means we have understood how to derive the formula to calculate the range of integers. And this means we are done with this topic that is range of integers. We learned how to derive the formula to calculate the range of integers. Now we are done with this lecture. In the next lecture we will understand fundamental data types in C++. So thank you so much for watching this lecture. I will see you in the next one. [Applause] [Music]"","
