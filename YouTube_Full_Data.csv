aUg-SL3fS1Q,US sanctions Russian oil companies after failed Putin talks | BBC News,"The US has announced new sanctions targeting Russia's two largest oil companies in an effort to pressure Moscow to negotiate a peace deal in Ukraine.
 
The announcement comes one day after US President Donald Trump said a planned meeting with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin in Budapest would be shelved indefinitely.
 
""Every time I speak to Vladimir, I have good conversations and then they don't go anywhere,"" Trump said.
 
While the economic impact to Russia is likely to be minimal, it represents a major shift in Trump's foreign policy, having previously said he would not impose sanctions until European nations ceased buying Russian oil. 
 
The Kremlin said Russia was ""immune"" to the sanctions.

The police revised down an earlier death toll of 63, saying they had mistakenly included victims who were unconscious and were now being treated.

One of the buses swerved in an attempt to avoid a crash, but in the process caused a ""head on and side collision"" that led to a ""chain reaction"" in which other vehicles lost control and overturned.

His intervention comes as the US attempts to shore up the ceasefire it helped to broker following an outbreak of violence at the weekend.

HyvlAecq3zE,Zelensky ready to join Trump-Putin talks after ‘frank’ White House meeting | BBC News,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said he would be ready to join Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin at a proposed summit in Hungary if he were invited.

The US and Russian presidents announced on Thursday they planned to hold talks on the war in Ukraine in Budapest, possibly in the coming weeks.

In comments released on Monday, Zelensky told reporters: ""If it is an invitation in a format where we meet as three or, as it's called, shuttle diplomacy… then in one format or another, we will agree.”

Meanwhile, media reports have suggested his White House meeting with Trump on Friday descended into a ""shouting match"" - with the US side urging Ukraine to accept Russia's terms to end the war.

5ySuOHWtDZw,BBC obtains copy of Virginia Giuffre's memoir | BBC News,"Virginia Giuffre said she feared she might ""die a sex slave"" at the hands of Jeffrey Epstein and his circle, her posthumous memoir revealed. 

The BBC has obtained a full copy of Nobody's Girl, written by the prominent accuser of convicted sex offender Epstein, ahead of its publication on Tuesday - almost six months after she took her own life.

gb5MqziF8vQ,Trump says Gaza ceasefire still in place as Israel and Hamas accuse each other of breach | BBC News,"US President Donald Trump says the ceasefire in Gaza is still in place, hours after Israel's military said it carried out a wave of strikes against Hamas.

The Israel Defence Forces said it would resume enforcement of the ceasefire, after Israel and Hamas accused each other of breaching the deal.

Strikes began in southern Gaza on Sunday after the Israeli military said ""terrorists fired an anti-tank missile and gunfire"" toward its troops in Rafah, killing two soldiers.

Hamas said it was ""unaware"" of any clashes in the area under Israeli control and said it was committed to the ceasefire, but accused Israel of violations and warned strikes could ""push the situation toward a total collapse”.
