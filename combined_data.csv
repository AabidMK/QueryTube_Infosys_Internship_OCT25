VmZtY4L7-Us,Why studying bees can teach us about human loneliness | Sarah Kocher | TEDxNewEngland,"Social interactions are essential for the survival and success of many animals, including humans. But how does the brain adapt to support these interactions? By comparing solitary wild bees and those in complex societies, scientists are uncovering fundamental biological patterns that illuminate how the 'social brain' develops and evolves to create the diversity of social life on our planet. 

Sarah is an assistant professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at the Lewis-Sigler Institute for Integrative Genomics at Princeton University. She studies socially variable bees (solitary, social, and socially flexible) to understand the factors that shape the evolution of social behavior. Her lab integrates methods from many different areas of biology, from evolutionary and population genomics to neurobiology and field ecology.

Or that connecting with someone, even briefly in a checkout line, can help to improve overall happiness? There are reward centers in our brain that get a little boost whenever we give to charities or we help someone in distress. Social connections hugely benefit our health. But there can also be costs when we lose these connections. Loneliness can increase a person's risk of death by 26% in any given year. We all know that humans are social creatures, but actually many of Earth's creatures lead social lives. Many insects, vertebrates, and even many microbes live and interact in social groups. And for each of these species, social interactions are tightly linked to their individual success. Their social partners can help or hurt as individuals attempt to find food, avoid predators, and secure mates. The thing is, we don't yet understand the mechanisms that underly social behavior. And this means that when these mechanisms start to go ary or even when we struggle with social interactions, we don't necessarily know how to help. But what if we could understand the mechanisms that underly social behavior? Imagine knowing that core set of molecular and neurobiological processes that regulate social interactions. This knowledge could help us better understand where to look when things start to break down. Social interactions are tightly linked to individual success. And in evolutionary terms, success is defined as an organism's ability to survive and reproduce. So that means that natural selection has shaped these traits. And it doesn't matter if we're thinking about humans or primates or even bees. Throughout the course of their natural histories, evolution has fine-tuned aspects of their brains to help them better navigate their social environments and interact with each other. And this set of changes is what scientists often refer to as the social brain. I'm an evolutionary biologist. And the goal of my lab is to understand the mechanisms that shape the evolution and the development of the social brain. Armed with this knowledge, we could learn general principles that give us new ideas of where to look as we develop new diagnostic tools or treatments for our own human social disorders. But how do scientists begin to understand the mechanisms that shape the social brain? Most of the time, we start by making comparisons among things that are the same and then we conduct controlled experiments where we manipulate a single variable of interest while we keep everything else constant. And this allows us to isolate the effect of that particular variable. So you may be thinking about lab studies that we can do using fruit flies or mice. In these systems, you can take a group of highly genetically similar individuals and you can give half of them a drug while you give the other half a placebo or a control. And this allows you to have the experimental precision that you need to understand the effects of that drug on your focal population. But as a result, it also limits the amount of variation that you can study. And this is a problem because we can only learn so much from studying things that are all the same. In the case of social behavior, a narrow behavioral range limits the scope of the questions that we can ask. Mice, for example, exhibit some forms of social behavior like mating and maternal care, but they all share a similar behavioral repertoire. So what if we want to understand what generates the potential for social interactions to arise in the first place? Then we would want to be able to compare and contrast individuals that live in social groups with those that do not. Unfortunately, most of the model systems that we currently use are limited in this respect. While we've learned a massive amount from studying these systems, they don't adequately capture this range of behavioral variation. And that makes it hard to identify that set of essential ingredients that are needed for social behaviors to arise in the first place. So what if there were another way? What if instead of comparing things that were the same, we could start by contrasting things that are different? Let's say that you want to learn how to make a a truly excellent cookie. Which is going to be more useful for you? 20 nearly identical chocolate chip cookie recipes that use the same ingredient set and vary only in the proportions of the ingredient that they're using or 20 wildly different recipes that use different types of sugars and different flavors and different add-ins. Miso chocolate chip anyone? By comparing and contrasting these wildly different cookie types, you can start to identify new groups of what we call same differences. And these same differences can teach us what makes a good cookie. For example, if you were to compare and contrast dark chocolate walnut with white chocolate macadamia nut, you might be forced to conclude that sweet and crunchy makes an excellent dessert choice. And by casting a wider net, you can learn what it is that makes a good cookie in general. We can apply the same approach to biology as well. Let's say you want to understand how animals adapt to extreme environments. Maybe you would start by comparing animals that live in the Arctic to those that live in the desert. You can then identify traits that are shared among the Arctic living animals and contrast those with traits that you find in the desert living ones. Arctic environments are extremely cold with lots of ice and limited vegetation. And examples of animals that live here include polar bears, arctic foxes, and seals. In contrast, desert environments are extremely hot with limited water and very sparse vegetation. And animals that live here include camels and fenic foxes and kangaroo rats. When you compare and contrast these different groups, you might notice that the Arctic mammals have a dense layer of fur and a thick layer of fat that surrounds their entire bodies. This allows them the insulation that they need to stay warm in the freezing cold. In contrast, the desert mammals have a thin layer of fur and they actually concentrate their fat in specific body parts and like camels that store fat in their humps and this allows them to avoid overheating in that extreme heat. Desert animals like the fenic fox have these huge ears that they can use to dissipate heat while the arctic fox has really small ears to help them retain it. And desert animals are active mostly at nighttime to help them avoid the scorching sun, while Arctic animals can be active in both daytime and nighttime. So, we can learn quite a lot by comparing groups of animals with similar traits and contrasting them with those that are different. We can use the same approach to understand social behavior better, too. By comparing groups of animals that live in social groups to those that do not. And through this process, we can start to identify sets of traits that are shared among the social organisms and not found in the social ones. And this set of same differences can help bring into focus what it is that makes the social organisms unique or different. And this helps us identify that set of features that have been refined by natural selection over time to shape the evolution of the social brain. I use this approach to study a group of wild bees known as sweat bees. Unlike many of the commonly studied model systems, sweatbees exhibit a wide behavioral range that includes both social and solitary individuals. Some sweat bees live in social groups where you have a reproductive queen and non-reproductive workers, and others live and reproduce independently. Throughout their evolutionary history, sweat bees have gained and lost social behavior a number of different times. And this generates a lot of natural variation that we can use as a lens to compare and contrast their genes and their brains and their behaviors. When we compare social sweatbees to sweatbees that are solitary, we've identified a core set of genes that have been shaped by natural selection as social behavior was gained and lost. And some of these genes are thought to play an important role in hormone binding and transport of that hormone into the insect brain. We've discovered that social sweat bees have higher levels of this hormone in their brains compared to solitary sweat bees. We've also zoomed out and we've looked in ants, which is another lineage of social insects that diverged from bees over 180 million years ago. Again, in the ants, we find that variation in the hormone levels in their brain is correlated with natural variation in their social behaviors. And we also know that hormones can regulate social behaviors in vertebrates as well. I mean, we've all met a teenager. These observations suggest that there may be overarching commonalities in the mechanisms that regulate social behaviors across vast evolutionary distances. And this suggests that from bees, we could learn general principles that could apply to our own human social behaviors as well. Evolution teaches us that many of the genes that regulate the insect brain perform similar functions in the vertebrae brain. We actually share 80% of our genes with cows and nearly 50% of our genes with fruit flies and with bees. Through our own work, we've discovered that at least some of the same mechanisms that regulate social variation in bees are also associated with variation in human social behavior. For example, when we compare genes that vary between social and solitary sweat bees of the same species, we find a significant overlap with genes that are linked to autism in humans. These results highlight how conserved mechanisms can shape variation in social behavior across vast evolutionary distances. that span from insects all the way to mammals. And they give us an important thread that we can start to pull on to begin to unravel what those mechanisms are that make the social organisms unique. And they help us to identify that set of features that have shaped the evolution of the social brain. Of course, we know that our behaviors are more than a product of just the genes that we carry, but it's also the environments that we experience. And it's really that interaction between genes and the environment that generates individual variation in behavior. We know that the environments that we experience as children can strongly influence the way that we behave as adults. And we know that different parenting styles can have really strong influences on an individual's social skills in adulthood. So if we really want to understand what makes and breaks the social brain, we need to understand not only the genes, but how these genes interact with the environment and how these interactions get encoded into the brain. And since we've already learned that we can understand social behaviors better by studying bees, why not compare and contrast how social and non-social individuals differ in their responses to social experience? We're already starting to do these experiments now to see if social individuals are more sensitive to their social environments compared to their solitary counterparts. And we are also interested in identifying which regions of the brain are the most sensitive to these differences in social experience. So far, we've conducted these studies in bumblebees, which all live in social groups. And when we isolate bumblebees from the colony, it changes the way that they interact with other bees. Insects use their antenna as their sensory windows to the world. And we think that internal contact is an important way that bumblebees exchange information with each other. We've discovered that uh bumblebees typically interact through something that looks like an antennal handshake. They approach each other face to face and then they briefly contact their antenna together. But when we isolate bees during a sensitive period in their early lives, they become much less specific in the way that they interact with other bees. Instead of these short, direct face-to-face interactions, they actually become much less predictable. It's as if you would meet someone the first time and you would go to shake their hand and then the next time you try to shake their face. We've also discovered that isolated individuals have much higher levels of variation in how their brains develop compared to bees that are reared in social groups. And we've identified a set of genes that vary in expression levels depending on social experience. And some of these genes are the same genes that we identified earlier that are linked to hormone binding and transport into the brain. Social experiences strongly impact behaviors in a wide range of animals and isolation can increase aggression and decrease sociability in species as wide ranging as spiders and mice and primates. And in humans, we know that early life social deprivation is linked to a higher risk of neurodedevelopmental and mental disorders in adulthood. So by studying the effects of social experience, we can gain a complimentary window that helps us understand how the social brain develops. To do these experiments, we've had to build the resources from the ground up. You can't order sweat bees on the internet and there are no breeding facilities. So we have to go outside and we have to find them and study them in the natural world. And this has been challenging work, but it's been totally worth it because we're gleaning exciting new insights into the pathways that are associated with social variation in the system. Our next steps are to understand how these pathway how these pathways function and to understand how they respond to different environmental inputs. And of course, we want to compare and contrast how social and solitary individuals respond to these differences. Through this process, we can start to identify that core set of mechanisms that make social organisms unique. And this can give us exciting insights into the underlying blueprint of the social brain. Social interactions are crucial to the lives of so many species. And when these interactions break down, the effects can be extremely costly. By studying animals that already vary in their social behaviors, we can learn exciting new things about that set of same differences that make social organisms unique. And this can give us new insights into the fundamental blueprint of the social brain that can apply to many species from insects potentially all the way to people. We can learn so much by studying the variation that's already out there in the world as long as we're open to it. Thank you.",1

When suddenly someone interrupts you and says, ""What the are you speaking? Is it Jamaica?"" I watched as the middle-aged Caucasesian man's face contorted with disgust and a doineering audacity as it interrupted my conversation in Euroba at a water park in Philadelphia, Mississippi. In that moment, I watched as a stranger's face became a map of prejudice and my identity became an anomaly. My Euroba language, a taste of home, was no longer a song to this man's here. It became a threat and it looked like my existence was at threat to him. Imagine a world where everyone sounded the same, flat, monochrome, without texture. It would be like painting a masterpiece with one dull color. In that kind of world, there wouldn't be the rich melodic richness of accent painting the canvas of human expression. Yet, we are somehow moving towards this monotony where some accents are treated like symphonies and others are called sensory overload. Like someone recently point out pointed out on social media, I'm a Nigerian scholar in Mississippi. I come from a country with over 520 languages where English is the official language as a result of colonial legacy by the British. Now back home we have our own complicated relationship with accent where some children who come back from abroad with British or American accent are treated like sophisticated or more intelligent. Now, a research shows that accents and languages in standard French and re and creole shows a complicated social and um a dynamic power play where some accents are treated as proper and others are treated as foreign. But who decides what's proper and foreign? And what does this relationship tell us about power, prejudice and the society and privilege? This hierarchy of accent followed me to the University of Mississippi. She needs to speak in American accent. A voice gives me migraine. Some students wrote in my TA evaluation. The irony, the same student had said that I needed to speak louder. But here I was realizing that the problem was not volume, but it was that I didn't sound like them. Here was I from a country whose official language is English, being told that my English was not English enough. Encounters like this are why I believe that celebrating accents and languages does not pose a threat to anyone's identity. Rather, it opens up a world to cultural appreciation and deeper understanding even to some of the food we eat. According to a research by Alen Moyer, it shows that accent enables linguistic profiling where some qualified personnel are denied for the job that they qualified for because of how they sound. Yet another research by Ellen Btock at York University shows that bilingual have um better way of solving problems. They are good at multitasking and getting things done things done. Yet we have turned this cognitive ability into a perceived deficit where some accents are deemed proper and some are deemed fake and some accents are seen as a measure of anyone's intelligence. This is why I started a classroom exercise. On the first day of the semester, I write a jangadi on the board. Ajang badi is a name of a vibrant community in Lagos. I ask my students to pronounce it. They stumble, the laugh, the try again. But in that moment, I tell them, just because you cannot pronounce this word does not mean that you're unintelligent. It only shows that your linguistic capabilities have limitations. In that moment, something remarkable happens and something shifts with the students. They realize that navigating a different sound system from the earth is a way to explore other linguistic word. Ajang then becomes more than a world. It becomes a mirror to check our unconscious biases and in that moment a body does what years of lectures cannot do. It challenges linguistic biases and it lets students see in real time that accents and languages is not just about perfection but that it's about connection. Look at Wles Shinka the Nobel laurette who is also a Nigerian. He writes in English but he bent the English language to carry the weight of the Euroba philosophy so that when he writes phrases like even a tear veiled eye preserves its function of sight he is not just creating poetry it's about preserving word views and he uses the English language to show that language is not just about um mere communication but it can also be used to preserve world views and is also creating a linguistic fusion. This kind of fusion can be seen in our everyday lives. Consider the Mexican Korean cuisine or the Indian Chinese cuisine and how they create a form of cultural and cuisine creativity. Now consider gumbo that quintessential southern dish with the name coming from West Africa. Kumbbo the fil powder coming from Chaka India the rule from French every bowl of goombbo tells a story of cultural coalition and the making of American south here's what's remarkable the same person who would eagerly devoy a gumbo might still cringe at the West African word that carries the word across the Atlantic. So, next time you want to talk about an accent, focus on the power of communication and clarity. In recent times, we are seeing how the celebration of linguistic diversity with um Korean drama taking the global stage. Um, Nollywood taking showcasing the Nigerian culture. Bollywood capturing its audience's attention. Um, social media banter such as wisdom is chasing you but you are running faster showcases the poetic genius of the Nigerian people. Now this tells us that language can be used for cultural appreciation. But accents do tell more than stories. They are stories evolving with the environments that we immerse ourselves in. For instance, Lupita Yongo once said that she felt like she was losing herself when she lost a Kenyan accent. Yet we have people like Chimamanda Adiche and Sophia Vagara who use their accent daily and authentically showcasing that global impact and accent can coexist and that accents are not obstacles and should not be a measure of anyone's intelligence. So the next time you hear me speak in my Nigerian accent or you hear an American accent slip into my Nigerian accent, it's not because I have suddenly become fake or proper, it's because I am a product of my environment and our environment changes us and tells the story of our journey. So, here's my invitation to you. The next time you hear an unfamiliar accent, treat it like a dish on a friend's dinner table. Lean in with curiosity. Dip your fingers. Ask questions. Savor every note and texture of their voice. Because every accent is a recipe passed down through generations. Every unusual pronunciation is an ingredient that adds depth to our collective human expression and experiences. Because in the end, accents do not diminish our humanity, they refine it. So, next time you hear an unfamiliar accent, are you brave enough to listen? Thank you.",1

mother on a trip to Las Vegas we were staying at the Venetian Hotel it's uh this uh beautiful hotel that actually replicates Venice from Italy and it has this ins Side Plaza with a canal and the shops and you can even take Gondola rides and my mother and I were coming out of the elevator and uh she was looking at the sides and she says it's getting so dark so early and I said what do you mean she says look it's it's already Sunset and I said um you see those uh little black dots on the sky those are spring lers we're still inside and she looked at the ceiling and she looked at me and she said and why did you have to tell me who then you let me enjoy it for a little while longer what my mother had experienced was an illusion a subjective perception that doesn't match the physical reality now when we talk about illusions outside of the laboratory we uh mostly think of those cases in which the discrepancy between perception and reality is largest but the fact is that we almost never have a perfect correspondence and which means that all or at least most of our experience is partly illus we never have a perfect match so we're going to go through through a few examples so that uh you can experience exactly what I mean if you look at this image you can see a grid with a number of vertical as well as horizontal lines they're actually horizontal now you may be thinking those are not horizontal lines those are oblique but that's the illusion that we're dealing with and the illusion is given but these little black and white squares that you see at the intersections of the bars we're going to get rid of them just by blurring the image a little bit and as the image gets blurred and those little squares become harder to see now you can face the truth the bars are perfectly horizontal in reality and you can actually if you don't believe me you can achieve the same effect just by blurring the image by squinting your eyes here's the trick even though now you know and you have proven to yourselves that these bars are actually horizontal rather than oblique that knowledge doesn't help you it doesn't help you at all the illusion is basically hardwire in your brain much as you try you cannot see those bars as horizontal now Illusions are happening all the time and they affect our visual system in in fact most of the Illusions in the sensory domain that we experience are visual Illusions now the visual system is the most complex of our sensory systems and it has the most Illusions which already tells you something about maybe these Illusions are actually helping us and they're not errors as they're often thought about but we also have Illusions in other senses we have auditor Illusions tactile Illusions and we have cognitive Illusions themselves that affect our thinking and our decision making our memory all sorts of cognitive processes let's talk a little bit more about visual Illusions this is an illusion that affects our perception of brightness you can see two sets of chest pieces white on top black on bottom or is it if you remove the background you can see that in fact this are the same exact chest pieces up and down for our brain there are in fact no absolute terms we don't have black or white everything depends on context and contrast same with color here we have a picture of two colored birds again I'm not telling you the truth what we're looking at is a black and white picture of birds with a colored GD superimposed now pixel by pixel you can see that color is very scarce in this image every most most of the pixels are by far on gray tones but our brain is taking the color information out of the grid and is using it to fill the rest of the Contours of this image now we often hear about AI hallucinating content and generating false information based on patterns more than facts the fact is our brain generates most of your experience we only take small snapshots tiny portions of reality and we construct not reconstruct we construct the rest we make it up so to speak we have talked about brightness and color now let's think about shape this illusion if we can turn it down a little bit thank you this illusion comes from the best illusion of the Year contest that I that I post annually and what you're looking at is an actual mirror like you have at home and an actual 3D object this is not AI generated it's not photoshoop this is an object that you can hold in your hands and what you're looking at is a matter of perspectives which is true the reflected image on the mirror or or the object in front of it well both of them are equally true and equally untrue as well again a matter of perspective I'll let you ponder that for for a little bit but we have actually the video has revealed the secret behind the illusion uh itself so it seems incredible and it really takes advantage of our assumptions about simple objects such as mirrors um appearances can be deceiving so and with that let's take a look at these beautiful pictures of beautiful people I want you to look at the very center of this image keep your eyes on the cross and these are the same people that you all know and love but they become very ugly very quickly you can look at them directly I'm not changing anything it's all happen happening in your brains right now look at the cross they become really hideous look at them directly they're gorgeous again what is happening here well again there are no absolutes for your brain even beauty is not an absolute and this all depends on contrast and comparison for each single pair of these images your brain is making a very quick comparison with what happened immediately beforehand and so somebody who has a regular size no nose is going to look in comparison to what came before like they have a huge nose and so on and so forth so so it's just very hard to know what's real and we can even get a sense for it ourselves right here and right now I want you to uh look at the very center of this image is important that you don't take your eyes away from the center because what we're doing right now is are adapting your motion sensitive neurons of your visual system to the directions of motion that are actually happening right now and we need to do this for about 30 seconds or so so keep looking at the center don't look away and so what's happening as you do this exercise is that the neurons in your visual system the neurons that are sensitive to the opposite directions of motion have not been adapted so they're going to respond uh more strongly in comparison now before the video your turns off again I want you to look at the face of the person that is sitting right next to you do it right now and and you should see something interesting so why is this happening well this is happening because even though we don't know exactly why it is that we experience Illusions rather than the truth we know a few principles and this principles come given by the fact that we don't have enough neural resources to process all the reality that is out there we're constantly bombarded by sensory information as well as by our own thoughts and memories and imaginations and plans and so forth we just don't have the neural machinery for all of that we're limited by the size of our brain and the size of our brain is limited by the birth canal and so we don't have enough neurons neuronal connections brain areas we have to pick and choose very carefully what we're going to extract from the world and we're going to take a lot of shortcuts one of them is feeling perceptual as well as cognitive gaps all the time we're filling in blanks with information that may be right or wrong we also impose order structure even though our environment our social and physical environment and inputs can be very disorganized we artificially organize them in our brain we impose our own order like in this illusion here we can see a GD in which only the center looks organized the two flanks are very disorganized but we're going to organize the whole thing right here right now in your own brains look at the center choose one of the intersections choose one of the crosses fix your gaze as cisely as you can and in just a few seconds your brain is going to take that nice orderly information from the center and apply it to the sides so that the whole grid becomes organized again you are the one doing it the physical grid is as disorganized as ever so we fill in blanks we impose order and we tell stories we tell stories to all people we tell stories to ourselves about how the world and even we ourselves work there was an experiment conducted in 2005 by a a group of scientists that came up they discovered the concept of what we call now Choice blindness what does this mean this is the general structure of the experiment experimental participants were given a choice between two pictures of real people and they had to pick the one that they thought was most attractive so people would pick whatever one they like best and they would point at it then the the scientists would turn both pictures um face down and they would ask the participant to grab the picture they just chose what the participants didn't know was that the scientist had been trained by a professional magician to conduct the slide of hand maneuver so when the participants picked the picture they thought they had chosen they ended up with the opposite picture the opposite of their choice now about 30% of the time people didn't realize they're having a swap so that's already kind of scary but but that wasn't even the worst part the worst part came when having pick the wrong picture without realizing they were asked okay so why did you choose that picture why did you think that was more attractive than the other photo and remember that's not the picture they chose they chose the opposite picture and you might think well these people obviously they didn't choose that picture they might be saying well I I don't know I I I I cannot think of anything I have no idea that didn't happen that didn't happen at all people came up with all sorts of reasons why they made that choice that they didn't actually make they would say well um well actually she she looks like this Aunt of mine that I'm really close to and that's why I chose her uh or like I really like her earrings that's why I made that choice even though the picture that they chose had no earrings so yeah liar liar pants of fire that's not why you chose it not at all so and they would they would lie to the experimenters they would lie to themselves presumably without realizing and so that very interesting because well it tells us that uh first we don't think and then they and then we act and uh it we may very well be doing the opposite at least some of the time we act and then we try to figure out why we did the things we did but also we try to interpret our own behavior from a third person perspective much like we're trying to guess the reasons for somebody else's actions like well that person didn't say hi to me in the morning is she mad at me maybe she have her coffee and we do the same thing to ourselves about our own actions we're we're just guessing why we do the things we do but I also see Reason for Hope because often times we organize about choices like should I move to a different city or uh should I uh spend the rest of my life with this person should I take this job offer and the fact is it doesn't matter it doesn't matter because whatever you choose you're going to come up with all sorts of reasons to tell yourself that I was the best choice that was a perfectly reasonable choice so we can we can just relax it's the fact is Illusions are here to stay and even if we wanted to get rid of them we couldn't and we wouldn't want to get rid of them because Illusions help us Illusions make us more effective they make us quicker they make us uh react more more effectively to our physical and our social environment Illusions also make us happier because for instance romantic relationships those that are most successful are the relationships in which people idealize their Partners they think that they're better looking that they're smarter than they're better people than they really are the um in a in mental health the fact is when faced in a gambling situation in the laboratory people who are depressed estimate their odds much more accurately that people who are not depressed people who are not depressed are unrealistically optimistic and that's a good thing for your mental health Illusions also help us um estimate distances in a sort of adaptive way from an evolution perspective we consider that a distance is longer when we estimate it while wearing a backpack than when we don't have a weight when we're not carrying a weight estimated in distance or we estimate that people that are holding a weapon are stronger and taller and scarier than the same exact people when they're holding a tool instead so so Illusions are helpful they're not uh error of our perception they're intrinsic to our experience and to the way that our brain works you and I and none of us have ever lived in reality you haven't even been there even for a visit all the reality that you have experienced has been mediated by your neural hardware and software so um learn to love your Illusions they're good for you they're here to stay and they are in fact what makes us human thank you,1
UxiiUkQeP4Y,What If Our Approach to Aging Is All Wrong? | Heather Durenberger | TEDxMinneapolis,"We recognize adolescence as a pivotal stage of human development, yet, we overlook an equally disruptive transition - the shift from independence to dependence in later life. Heather Durenberger introduces the Adolescence of Aging, a psychologically distinct stage that we must acknowledge, not only to support our aging loved ones but to prepare for our own inevitable journey. 

Heather Durenberger is a nonprofit strategist, mom of four, and daughter navigating the real-time demands of supporting her parents, while working to shift the national conversation around this overlooked life stage. She is the co-founder of “People in the Squeeze,” a movement and podcast amplifying the voices of those caught between raising children and supporting aging loved ones. Alongside co-founder Jayne Dow Larkin, Heather co-authored “Thriving in Chaos: Navigating the Challenges of Aging Parents,” a best-selling guide to spark change and offer practical support for adult children in the thick of caring for aging parents. A proud Twin Cities resident, Heather brings lived experience, humor, and heart to a topic that touches nearly every family - and deserves far more attention.

But what if I told you there's another adolescence that we're not prepared for? Imagine trying to pry the car keys away from your 79year-old dad who sometimes drives like Mario and Dreddy and other times like he's in bumper cars. It's as if he's taken the Thelma and Louise going off the cliff approach to aging. This is the moment that no one is prepared for when our aging loved ones need more supports and they think we are the problem. Fast forward 10, 20 years when our own bodies begin to age and we need more supports. Adult children of aging parents live in this emotional tugof-war between safety and autonomy, logic and denial, love and pure hair pulling frustration. It is happening every day quietly behind closed doors in our country. Well, that changes today. Introducing the adolescence of aging. This is a turbulent life stage when our fiercely independent aging parents start needing us yet resist help at every turn. I am a daughter who knows this stage intimately. It started nine years ago with a phone call. My mom was in crisis, the victim of financial elder abuse north of $1 million. That moment put me in the squeeze. You know that place where I was trying to balance career, kids, and caregiving in a world that acts like it doesn't exist, but it does. And 37 million adult children in the United States are stuck in it, overwhelmed and wondering, ""How did I get here?"" We expect teenage rebellion, mood swings, and even temper tantrums. But we're surprised when our elders begin to act like mean teenagers with checkbooks and better medications. Adult children show up to help and we're caught in this tangle of emotions, of frustration, fear, and powerlessness. In grad school, I researched dopamine, especially around reward, motivation, and stress. I got an MBA to understand how people behave in systems, families, workplaces, and communities. What I didn't expect was my academic curiosities would one day serve as a lifeline for some of life's most personal and chaotic moments. We prepare for having babies, puberty, and even retirement. But what if there's an equally disruptive transition from independence to dependence that has no name and no playbook? And let me tell you, it's stunning. Not only in the behavior, but how lonely this moment feels. This isn't just my story. It's our story. This is a natural stage of development that no one is talking about. There's real psychology behind what we have coined the adolescence of aging. Eric Ericson and his wife Joan wrote about the ninth stage of development. Dr. Mark Franco wrote about the five stages of aging. Both map the slow, sometimes sudden shift from independence to end of life. Yet somehow this research and conversations still hasn't come to the kitchen tables. And it's not just psychology, it's neuroscience. The preffrontal cortex, the part of the brain that's responsible for weighing risks, multitasking, and even self-regulation. This is one of the last parts of the brain to fully mature in adolescence and young adulthood. Research is pointing it might be the first to decline as we age. So, just like teenagers slam doors and make bad choices, our aging parents may begin to act similarly, not because they're trying to be difficult, but because their brains are changing. Which is why the adolescence of aging isn't just a metaphor. It's a way to understand, prepare, and respond with compassion where words like aging and dementia fall short. We begin with the 3Ds that define the adolescence of aging. The first, defiance. It's the number one question that we get. What do we do about the car keys? Balancing your parents' safety with the need for independence and control. It's tricky. It's not just about transportation. It's about identity and who gets to decide. My lived example, I heard I'll drive until I hit something. That something was a semi. For adult children, we are surprised by this meanness and negativity from our aging parents. We feel guilty asking questions. We are hurt by the defiance and confused by who our parents are becoming. The second attribute, denial. It shows up as a defense mechanism, a way to push back against the uncomfortable truth that roles are shifting. They're not ignoring the reality to be difficult. They're holding on to a version of themselves that still feels capable, independent, and in control. My lived example, that fall, I just tripped on the carpet. Or the doctor says I'm fine. He just wants to run a few more tests. Or, I don't need a hearing aid. You just mumble. Adult children are like, ""Uh, mom and dad don't need help. Falling is normal."" Or, ""Dad doesn't need a walker. He says it makes him look old. He's 87 years old."" Denial leads to self-doubt. We begin to question ourselves. Am I crazy? Am I overreacting? Am I taking away their agency? The third attribute is decline which shows up in waves of physical, cognitive and emotional changes. Sometimes gradual, sometimes like a freight train. My lived example, a phone call from police. My mom had been found outside in the snow barefoot. She had been there for hours. She didn't know how she got there. She didn't know what happened. It happened so fast. She said it was jarring, like she was waking up in someone else's story. For adult children, decline is allconsuming. From multiple emergency room visits to figuring out rehab to finding home care, it's exhausting. One minute you're googling home care at midnight in a group text with your siblings and the next you're explaining for the fifth time why a mandatory evacuation zone means everyone and with good reason. Decline isn't failure. This is a natural stage of development that no one talks about and we were never taught to expect. The outcome is the fourth D. a quieter felt disempowerment. But don't let the quietness fool you. When aging parents lose control over decisions, routines, and even small things like what's for dinner, it can trigger deep emotions, shame, grief, even anger. That's why sometimes my loved ones went from zero to nuclear. It's not just about what's happening. It's about what it represents. A loss of agency and a loss of self. For adult children, in an effort to control this new chaos that comes into our world, we try to outmaneuver risk before it turns into a crisis. Here's the problem. In an effort to try to keep them safe, we can strip away what matters most, the right to choose. For aging parents, too much control disempowers. For adult children, too much freedom courts danger. This is the tension we walk. It's not defiance, denial, and decline. It's developmental. That's why Jane, my business partner, and I wrote Thriving in Chaos: Navigating the Challenges of Aging Parents, so families will have a playbook. We started People in the Squeeze, a voice in the movement to raise awareness and to change the way we experience the challenges of aging parents. Because when you're in the squeeze, it can feel like you're the only one stuck between career, kids, and caregiving. People in the squeeze is for all of us caught in the messy middle navigating hard conversations and secondguessing every decision. It's a reminder that it's okay to laugh, cry, and even lose it many times before breakfast. When you're deep in the adolescence of aging, it can feel like everything is happening to you. You can't change your parents diagnosis. You can't force a sibling to engage. You can't stop professionals who sometimes don't have the time or patience your loved ones deserve. Our bodies and minds can be hijacked by the stress, often called the fight, flight, or freeze response. That's activated by the amygdala, the part of the brain that's responsible for threat detection. And under stress, this can cause us to flip our lid, temporarily shifting resources away from our thinking and brain towards immediate survival needs, which limits our ability to respond with care and compassion. That's why we created the PACE model as a way to center yourself in the storms of caring for your aging parents. The first step, P, pause, take a breath. A, assess, look around. What are you seeing? What are you feeling? C, choose, respond with intention. E, embrace, move forward with clarity. When you take a moment to pause, you can calm your brain, gather your senses, and most importantly, breathe. Breath is your body's reset button. It's the most powerful tool we have to reset and regulate from the stress response. Pacing yourself slows things down. It creates space. It asks questions. It considers other possibilities. And most importantly, it leads with compassion. Here's how pacing yourself showed up for me. On a trip across the country to visit my mom after a long day of travel and time with her, I decided to step out and spend time at my niece's volleyball game, only to get a call that mom had fallen and was being taken to the emergency room by herself. Knowing her limitations, I couldn't imagine her navigating the chaos of the emergency room by herself. I rushed to the facility and took her to the emergency room. I hadn't eaten all day. My phone was dead and my nerves were shot. When the staff said, ""If we need you, we'll come and get you."" As they took her back, I thought, ""Oh boy, you have no idea. I took this moment to take a small break from the chaos. I stepped outside. I looked at the stars. I stretched and I took a deep breath. I even made a tick tock in the parking lot to remind myself and others the importance of pausing. I assessed and realized my mom's needs were shifting. I chose to focus on what I could control. I chose to not lose it with the facility staff over mom's fall and I chose to not add to the evening's drama because yes hard things are happening but in the middle of all of it one thing remains in our control how we can respond. You can decide sometimes every day, every hour not to let those hard things define the temperature of the room. And sometimes it begins with a single breath under the stars. Here's another learning. This journey doesn't just impact you. It shapes everyone around you. It's what remains after the diagnosis or even after the funeral. This is the imprint you leave behind. It's the relationship with your siblings. The memory your kids carry of how you showed up for hard. What did they learn by watching you? This isn't about perfection. This is about protection. Protecting the ones you love and protecting the professionals who work very hard to care for our aging parents. We can't always change the circumstances, but we can choose how we show up. If you're in the squeeze now, here are some practical first steps. You don't have to have it all figured out. You just need a place to start. The Adolescence of Aging gives you a road map. Say it out loud. I'm in the squeeze. I want us to try it. On the count of three, we're going to say it together. 1 2 3. I'm in the squeeze. Excellent. Now, find someone to tell your story, the real messy story. Begin to have conversations sooner, even if it's sticky, tricky, and sometimes icky. Begin to normalize it's okay to not have it all figured out. Practice asking for help, not because you're weak, but because you're strong enough to know you can't do it alone. Those tips are for us in the squeeze right now. But this conversation is bigger than that. Today you have a chance to help us shift this story. You can help make this better by talking about the adolescence of agings with others. Just like we did with adolescence, we can build language tools and supports. We began this journey not as experts but as overwhelmed daughters. We thought we were alone in this and we realized we aren't and neither are you. What if we had systems in place that supported families through this life stage? Imagine knowing what's coming, saying, ""I know where I am. I know what to expect and I know my first steps."" Because here's the kicker. The adolescence of aging isn't about age. It's about the shifting capacity of our aging loved ones. And if it feels real, that's because it is real. It's not just emotional, it's biological. So when mom says, ""I'm fine. I've always driven that way."" It's not stubbornness, it's human development. And just like with adolescence, the first battleground is driving, money, and decisions. So, let's call this what it is, a natural stage of development. Let's name it, normalize it, and build the safety rails we'll need. If not today, then for tomorrow, and maybe, just maybe, we can go back to being daughters and sons.",1

So, I decided to start being organized, and it changed everything. First, being organized saves time. When I pack my bag the night before, I don't have to rush in the morning. I can eat breakfast, relax, and even talk with my family. It feels so calm and peaceful. Second, being organized keeps me calm and happy. When my desk is neat, my brain feels clear, too. It's easier to think, learn, and smile. And third, being organized helps me do better at school. Now, I can find my books easily, and I never forget my homework. My teacher doesn't have to remind me anymore, and that makes me proud of myself. So, why is organization important? Because it saves time. It helps us do better at school, and it keeps us calm and happy. Start small. Tidy your desk, pack your bag the night before, and see how great it feels to be organized. If I can do it, you can, too.

I come from Orange Primary School to talk about a very serious topic, racism. Now, imagine a picture of art full of colors. If racism continues, those colors would fade out, making the picture look plain and boring. Not good, is it? Past experiences in my life have shown me that I'm I don't belong to this world, that I'm not a part of it. I stopped trying because I thought it was a waste of time and that there was no real purpose to it. I felt left out and angry, but I didn't know what to do. Luckily, my dad noticed and he encouraged me every single day. My colors came back and I was happy. I always gave my best and I always tried. But we all don't have my dad, do we? This is why we should all be that person to encourage everyone else to always try their best. So if you can greet somebody and tell them they matter, cuz truth is they do. And even a small smile helps. That positivity can create a better world for all of us. Now, racism also hurts the economy because it holds back productivity and innovation. This limits access to education, healthcare, and fair wages. Now, if I just took what I said 2 seconds ago and simplified that, what I'm trying to say is that families are losing their privileges just because someone was being racist to them. Now, if you ask me, that's pretty absurd. like they will just feel left out and not try just like I did before. And talking about feelings, have you ever felt that you can't do anything just because someone said so due to your skin color, race, or religion? Well, if they did, let me tell you one thing. The words that come out of their mouth, you shouldn't be able to hear them. Matter of fact, you shouldn't be able to feel them cuz you should be yourself and you do you. But if you're a kid, listen to your parents cuz it might not end well for you. Now, trust me when I say that if one person smiles, everyone smiles. See, people are already smiling. This is how we can make a funner, safer, and better world for all of us. So be what you want to and keep a positive mindset. And if anyone tries to ruin that, you ignore them and listen to your hearts. Thank you.",1

Lights, camera, and action. All right. Now, just what if you just close your eyes and recall your favorite scene from a film? What do you see? Maybe it's the shimmering lights of the city on a wet pavement. Maybe it's just the way a single tear rolled down an actor's cheek. If you remember these scenes and you can recall it till now that is the magic of cinematography and the usage of cinematography was done by the cinematographer obviously and that's where the cinematographer wins because the main goal of a cinematographer is to deliver the audience a scene that is so good that they remember it for a long time. Good afternoon everyone. My name is Moazali Khan from Great Ajax Solit Global Schools and today I'm going to speak on a very underrated topic but interesting which is script to screen. All right. So first there is cinematography. There are multiple names for cinematography but the first one is the art of motion picture photography. But that name it's just like saying a chef's job is to heat food which obviously isn't. There is so much in cinematography. There is first thing the main thing is choices. A cinematographer chooses the lights, frame, movements, locations even in the scripts. So there's so much to cinematography as you can see. But people don't recognize it for some reason. It is embedded in the world somewhere. There's many less people that talk about it. All right. So it's the diff cinematography is the difference between a just a random clip of the sea and this scene from Titanic where the Titanic is sinking and there is a lifeboat which which contains people in it. Now it is supposed to be a negative scene and it is but there is the reflection of the sky and the ship uh on the seabed. Now notice how beautifully and how perfectly how detailed the scene is and it's a negative scene. So that is cinematography. So now let's go deep and do more research. All right. What is a cinematographer's job? A cinematographer's job is to convert the director's narration into visual into visually moving pictures, creating scenes with his unique abilities and creativity. A cinematographer blends his technical skills with artistic intuition to deliver and serve the best scene that the audience can visually see and be visually pleased with. It's not just about creating a scene. You have to look at the location, frame, movement, even the camera angle and the camera too with the model of the camera and even the camera lens. The cinematographer has to be that detailed and experienced. Now moving on, let's talk about where do we learn cinematography? It's such a big art. Just go watch your favorite film. Now a question may arise in your mind. Moz, what are you saying? We we can learn such a big of and a beautiful art just by watching a favorite film. No, you can't. But the basics obviously you can. Now go to your home, watch your favorite film. Don't just watch it. Observe it very keenly. Observe the scene. Observe what the scene is about. Observe the objective of the scene. Observe the music that is playing in the background. If it's an emotional scene, obviously there will be a soft, very elegant uh music playing in the background. And if it's an action scene, there's obviously very much a camera movement. There going to be multiple camera movements, cuts, intensity, pressure. There's going to be so much of things that you can notice if you just observe it. And you just realize, oh my days, I was missing out on so much. I was just watching it and not observing. I could have learned so much just by watching my favorite film and watching my favorite scenes. Now what how can we bring a film to life? How do we make a film? There are three main procedures. First is pre-production. Then there is production. Then there is post-p production. In pre-production, there is making of scripts, title, casting, and taking per permissions from the government. If if you're shooting on a public location and and just deciding the visual style, how we're going to take the first shot, second shot, they're going to visually memorize it and create it with their creativity. Then comes the production, the main thing, the actual shooting where there are actors on the set, there is a whole crew on the set, there are schedules made for particular people, for the actors and for different kinds of people. And there the cinematographer works closely with the uh with the director and just me just creates mesmerizing sequences. Then finally comes the post-prouction. In post-production, there is editing, color grading, creating additional music uh and background scores to add into the film as an element. And then there is distributors contracts. Then finally there's the premiere. Then the audience can watch the film and enjoy. All right. Now notice the picture of this. This represents now this is a topic called framing what you see in the shot. Now look at this. Look at the position of the character. This is the classic movie called Matrix. Many of you might know it. Now this character his name is Neo and he's stopping bullets by his bare hands. Now if you if you go through cinematography this define this is defined as if the the character's position changes the story. You know if the character is standing in the middle in front of the camera in the middle of the shot that means the character is very confident powerful and you know he's in charge. So that is exactly what is going on. Now notice the uh background is partially blurred out so you know you can just see the character and you know be pleased with it and and the and you can see that how powerful he is. He's stopping bullets from his bare hands and he's in the middle. So that's what defines it. Now my favorite and also the cinematographers's favorite topic, light. Moz, are you serious? Light is the favorite topic of you and cinematographers. Yes. You know why light can speak without any words. It is such a beautiful language that you can just define a scene just by light. Even if you mute a scene and it and it is defined beautifully, very perfectly in detail by light by just light, you can be very visually pleased. All right? So there are different kinds of specific lights for specific situations. For example, if there's a harsh light in the scene, on the character or in the background, that means that the character is menacing. He's powerful. He's the man in charge. He he's the man that you listen to. He's the big man. And if there's a soft light, that means the character is vulnerable. He or she is stubborn, hesitant a little. And if there is a golden light, golden light has so many varieties that you can use in. You can use it in dancing sequences, you can use it in action sequences, you can use it in mostly anything. Like there are so many scenes that you can see golden light. But mostly goal light is used in nostalgic scenes where the character is experiencing nostalgia or the audience has must feel nostalgic. All right. Now this is the movie Godfather. The director of the film Gordon Willis hid Marlon Brando's eyes in shadow. He casted a shadow on him. Why? Why you may ask? As you notice, there is a shadow cast in in his eyes that makes him look, unreadable, mysterious, dark like he is the big man. You can't you can't decide if he's the antagonist or the protagonist. He is made in such a way people most people can't understand him. That's the character that the director and the cinematographer has created just by the usage of light. That's the power that the light can use and that's why it's the most powerful language in cinematography. Now moving on, camera movement, how the story breathes in an action film. Obviously, so many of you have watched action movies and so many of you love action movies. Me too. I love action movies. of whenever you see an action scene, a fighting sequence where two two of the characters are are in a fighting sequence, they both just are angry at each other. They're furious. Do you see the camera still on a tripod? Even if you have placed your camera on a tripod, you can't move it around. The movement is so limited. That is the reason people use and the directors use handheld cameras. Handheld cameras can make you feel the action. It makes you live in the action. It makes you feel like you're in the action in the film. So that is why. And now notice this scene. This is the film, a very very uh beautiful film called 1917. Now, now just notice this scene. Observe it for a moment. What do you see? You're seeing a scared soldier running uh running in just plain brass. And there's an explosion behind. But there's something unusual that you see, don't you? The other soldiers, majority of the soldiers are running another way. And he's running towards the camera. Why? All right. Now, let me do a brief breakdown of this scene. In this film and in this scene, he's running to his colonel to give to pass on some sensitive information coming from the high command. Now he's scared because he can't find the colonel. And now his country and his border is in danger. And now, as you may see, it's not obviously a tripod because he's running and and he's not that fast to run as f as fast as a car. So obviously they're using a cameraman. And look at his expression, the actor's expression, how it defines the scene. And when there's breathing, stumbling, falling off, screaming so much more in the scene just because of a handheld camera. If if it was a still camera, they couldn't have done so much more in the scene. It would it would have been a very boring scene. It has so much definition. It is so well defined that you can feel that you're you're watching this film and you know how what soldiers go through, what soldiers went through in our history. All right. So now how to frame feelings in the film? All right. Whenever a movie is released, what do you see on the internet or social media? You see the reviews of people passing on you you sometimes see negative comments that the actors have not performed very well that the sometimes it's the actors have performed very well and they praise them. So now it's even the cinematographers uh uh job too to frame feelings into the film. Now how do they do that? There are so many things that you can frame feelings into. First, the most used one and the most common one is light, music, background score. And the main thing is the actor's performance. A cinematographer and the director just gives you a theory. They they say you have to cry in the scene because of this and that blah blah blah. But you have to create that thing in your mind. How am I going to cry? How is my face going to look? How's my facial expressions going to look? So that's what you decide and you act. That's why there's so now example in the film that is a mean every one of you I can confirmly say that this movie is a very classic movie and a nostalgic movie for sure it's my favorite film now this scene you might have remembered that Ishan is crying in his hostel's restroom why he's missing his mother and he's so lonely there's no one present to you know console him or just be it's going to be Okay, Ishan, I am with you. Everything's going to be fine. There was no one with him at that moment. Now, now look at this picture and look at Ishan's face. He's crying and there's a tear that is about to fall from his chin that defines that he's so sad. And obviously, as I've said before in the speech, there is a cold blue light in the background and you can see the cold blue light and the reflection of it. So that defines that he's so lonely and now and he's in a very uncomfortable position. He's not in a comfortable position as you can see. He's he's in his hostel's restroom. And if you remember this scene perfectly. Now there's a song called Mary Ma. Now there's a lyric going on defi defining that he's missing his mom. He he's scared of the dark and so much more. Now now you can just see the acting and the direction, the narration and the visual. You know how visually pleasing the scene is, how well it is defined. Just see it. Tears. It looks that he is sad and he was just 9 years old. That guy was just 9 years old and he's going through so much. All right. Now I would just like to define a a small photo a image from the movie Padmawat directed by Sanjalila Bansali. Now look at Reanir Singh and look at the background. The background is blurred out. You can you can partially see the characters. The these are his soldiers and his name in the film is Alouden. Now look at him. He's giving an evil smirk. You can just you know identify how evil this man can be. How how brutal, how cruel, arrogant he is by his smirk. Just that can define. Now that is an actor's job and that is the reason he got an award after that film for that film. And you can see how how nicely the uh the director has presented the character how well it is defined. Now this now this job was done by the cinematographer and the director for sure but even the actor played it very well. All right. Right. So in the climax, what I would like to say is see the world differently, man. Like whenever you see a film, don't just sit there and be like, ""Wow, what a story."" Observe it. Observe it keenly. Be, ""Oh my god, the music, the soft music, the lighting, cold blue light, that that means he's lonely."" And if if it's just a music, if it's even a song, even a song can define how what the character is going through. the lyrics, the music, there is so much more. And music can play with your emotions. Remember that. So yeah, cut. It's a wrap. Thank you everyone.",1

My topic today is how cyber bullying affects a child's learning and wellbeing. Imagine a quiet family home after school. The sun is setting, dinner plates clink in the kitchen, laughter drifts from the living room, and for most the day is over. But for Charlie, her phone pulses with notifications. crew messages, mocking group chats. A photo was posted online without consent. Soon everyone saw it and she was labeled as loser Charlie. The memory of what happened that day still feels so fresh. I was scrolling through my feed seeing the usual stream of memes and selfies when I saw it. A photo of my friend Charlie posted on social media without her consent. Her face was twisted into a funny expression tad with a cruel caption calling her a loser. She got comments like, ""You're so ugly. Go and die. The world would be a better place without you."" My stomach dropped. I tried to reach out to rewind time, but I couldn't. I felt trapped as if I were watching my friend being attacked from inside a locked room. Because this problem wasn't just an online incident. It followed her into her thoughts, her learning, and it even crept into her schoolwork. The next morning, she walked into school and everything had changed. Eyes follow her, whispers, rise like a tide. People point, eyebrows, facial hair, small things. But under the spotlight, they felt enormous. The classroom that used to feel safe becomes heavy. hardp pounding words and said, ""She shrinks."" In the weeks that followed, she couldn't stop thinking about how she looked. Her reflection became a constant source of anxiety, which led to drowning out thoughts of school. She began skipping classes, offering excuses, and her grades started falling. Imagine a once bright student who loved coming to school, now avoiding it, avoiding interaction, avoiding herself. Her change in behavior was noticed. Teachers and parents stepped in which then intervened and she was referred to a counselor. Slowly with support, she learned to speak about her feelings, rebuild her confidence, and talk about her fears. But the emotional scars left behind would take time to heal. I used to believe cyber bullying was a rare situation. But after I saw what happened to Charlie and so many other people, I realized it was anything but distant. I saw how one thoughtless post, one of a comment can shift someone's entire world. Suddenly, they worry more about their appearance, lay awake wondering if people are laughing unseen. And at school, what once was a place to grow now becomes a place to shrink. It's hard to raise your hand when you're fragile. Hard to learn when your mind is elsewhere. So, what can I do starting out to make a difference? Creating the school community group dedicated to creating a safe and supportive environment for all students. We would focus on important social topics such as cyber bullying, mental health, peer pressure, and helping students in distress through open discussions, awareness campaigns, and peer support. We would aim to build the positive change in our school community. We would also emphasize on what respect looks like online and what to do if someone crosses the boundary. We learn, share, and help each other. Cyber bullying isn't just a cage issue. It's the mirror of the world we're building. Let's build a safe digital world where kindness drs our cruelty, where every voice is heard, where no one feels alone behind a screen. We all have a role to play, so let's choose to be the reason someone feels like they belong. Thank you.",1

(Clears Throat) Good afternoon everyone. My name is Chiara and today I want to tell you how sport, especially gymnastics, changed my life. Before I started doing sports, I was pretty shy and I didn’t know many people. And I didn't always feel confident. But then I joined gymnastics and everything started to change. At first I joined just for fun. I didn't think I would be very good at it, but I kept trying. Little by little I got better at handstands, cartwheels and balance. It was challenging, but also exciting. And and. Every time I learned something new, I felt proud of myself. Sports taught me more than just skill. I learned how to be patient, how to work hard, and how to keep going even when things were tough. It also helped me stay healthy and strong. And I have more energy now and feel much more better inside and out. One of the best parts is that I made friends through gymnastics. We helped each other improve. We laughed, supported each other and had so much fun. Some of my closest friends are people I met through sports, so sports for me didn't just make me stronger, they helped me become a happier person. I'm really thankful for what I've learned, and I hope more people can experience the joy and well-being of sports too. Sports aren't just about winning trophies or breaking records. They are... And the courage. They are about growth and joy and the courage to keep trying. Also, for children with special needs, sports can be a powerful tool that opens doors to new possibilities. The problem is, kids aren't confident in themselves and don't have these opportunities to build confidence. So to build confidence that kids need in life skills. Hear them out. If you give them a sport that they don't, they don't want to do or don't have interest in, they will not be confident and will actually lose confidence in themselves and sport. (Clears Throat) And will not want to do sports again. (Clears Throat) And if you just ask them what sport do you may want to do? They will want to play. They will want they will build confidence and be confident in themselves. What can I do to help these kids without confidence? I know that some kids don't have the time or support to join a sport. I want to help those kids. I can make a change by starting a free sports club in school and encouraging kids to join. It will support children by giving them a safe space to try new sports. My goal is to build confidence of others. Thank you for listening. (Crowd Cheering)",1

Have you guys ever felt alone or abandoned? So today I want to talk about something that many of us don't talk about enough. The emotional struggles of children. You see, people often think that childhood is about fun, play, and carefree living. And yes, childhood would be those things. But everything is not that simple. We live in a world where children feel judged and misunderstood. We hear phrases like, ""You're just the kid. What do you have to worry about?"" But let me ask you something. If children don't go through real problems, then why do so many children feel anxious or even scared sometimes? If everything is so easy, then why do so many children cry silently locked in the rooms, feeling like no one understands? So many children go through tough times in silence. And today, I want to explore why. Here are the many reasons why children feel these ways. Children often fear that if they express their emotions, people will laugh at them or even ignore them or say they're being a little bit dramatic. They might they might think they might say that. What if they think I'm weak? What if they don't believe me? That fear stops them to speaking up. So instead of actually opening up, they they lock their feelings inside them. Many kids feel the need to meet high expectations, get top grades and behave perfectly. But perfection is impossible and the profess and the pressure to be perfect can be heavy even when mistakes happen and they always chew. Children start feeling like failures. Expecting more can make them feel like they need to be outstanding which can actually turn into pain. Children often fear that when they're trying to when they're trying to be be perfection, they might think that, oh, I have to I have to sound more. I have to go try harder. But all of this can is can really build up on many parts of a children like their mental health, like their mental health or even many parts of their body or the and then because of that children can fall into depression. Now I would like to talk about of the problems with children when act when they actually happen like parents spending quality time with their children not helping them out during hard times and which makes them feel like alone that they can't express their emotions or actually be themselves. Now I like to talk about my personal recount. So there was a time where everything when I felt like everything around me was falling apart. I felt lost and I didn't even feel hurt. I felt like I couldn't be myself and I laughed. I smiled at school with my friends but inside I felt hurt. So one day someone simply looked at me and asked how how was I really? That one question, that one changer moment had changed everything about me. And for the past few weeks I finally felt heard. That's when I realized how powerful it is when someone actually notices and actually look up look ups you. Now I would like to talk about of how you guys can fix this problem. Parents spend quality time with their children. Always ask if they are okay cuz bonding with their the child can make them feel like they actually belong here. And also truly connecting with your children can make them feel like they actually can be themselves and then they can express their their their mood or always awesome if they are okay. Child are not just marks on paper because children might be failing tests because they're fighting silent battles at home. These can come from school bullying, pressure or many other arguments with maybe family problems with with this ch children. These all these problems can create a huge impact on them which can affect their learning and their well-being which can also affect their future and past life. Now, I would like to say I can fix this problem. I won't just bury all of my problems within myself. I will go out to someone and talk about my own feelings, too. I I have the need to express myself to others like a family or even a friend. If I don't have anyone to talk to, I can always write them in a journal. I can always start meaningful conversation with others. I can look out for others and always ask if they're really okay since someone asks me that and it changed everything about me. I can do the same for someone else. I can always remind myself that I don't need to be perfect. I can allow myself to take mistakes and we take breaks and take mistakes because we are all human and we all make mistakes throughout different stages of our lives because just by taking all that perfection can really build up a lot of lot of rocks on someone or even our children which can also affect them a lot. Now I would like to say about how I think that this this should like stop. Firstly, I think that children should have the need to express themselves. Always think that they're the they might always think that they're the ones feeling this way, but many kids are feeling certain ways and we want we need to create a better world. We can actually fix this. As I come to the end of the speech, I want all of us to think about that many kids go through different times and hard times in their stages like like emotional struggles which affects their mental health and many other things which children actually fall upon. Many of them think that they can't be themselves or I always have to be outstanding which can actually affect them and which they might think that oh I have to do this and I have to do that. But it's really hard for children, especially kids who are younger than us who always need someone with them and because they always think that they can't be themselves. So here's my challenge to all of us. I want all of us to think that think that children always go through different stages and we know that because if you're feeling this way, I I want you to think and say I can go up to someone and actually express my problems. I can go up to them and tell them about everything I have been through because taking that brave important step can actually make someone feel like they truly have been heard and that can actually they can actually be themselves.

My name is Mariam Masmal and I'm from grade 10. Before I begin, I want you to imagine a room, a room similar to this. It's buzzing with energy and it's filled with great minds, innovators, and entrepreneurs. They're pitching ideas, closing deals, changing the world, the usual. But now imagine half of the half of these voices disappear into thin air like they never existed. Not because they weren't smart enough or not because they weren't ambitious enough, but because the room was never built with them in mind. This is what most women in business feel every single day. Invisible by design, not by choice. I know this might sound like a cliche. You've heard it before, right? Times are changing. Women are rising. the gap is closing. And while yes, it does look like that on the surface, if we dig a little deeper and take a look at the numbers, it reveals a whole different story. Last year in 2024, over 50% of business graduates were women. Amazing. But then how do you explain that only 10% of Fortune 500 CEO positions were held by women? or a howly 2% of capital venture funding worldwide goes to women at startups. And for women of color, this number drops below 1%. This isn't a coincidence. This is this is not a gap. It's a canyon. And no, it's not it's not a coincidence. It's a reflection of our structures, policies, and the way our system works or doesn't work. That pushes women to the sides and holds them back. Let me be loud and clear though. This isn't just a women's issue. It's a human issue, a social issue, and most importantly, a business issue. When women are left out, businesses miss out. We keep telling women to lean in to be more confident. But what about the system they're leaning into? What if the ladder they're climbing never actually reaches the top? You see, injustice doesn't always scream. Sometimes it whispers. It whispers in performance reviews with comments like, ""She's too aggressive. She's too emotional. She should smile more."" It whispers in job interviews where women get asked questions that men aren't. Are you planning on having any kids? Are you married yet? It whispers in salary negotiations where women are offered less and are told to be grateful. It whispers in boardrooms where a woman pitches a creative idea and here's silence. These aren't just random moments. There are patterns. And do you know what patterns tell us? They tell us where exactly the cracks in the system lie. Unfortunately, this issue goes deeper than just business. It starts way early before the boardrooms in our classrooms, our homes and our media. Little girls praise for being nice and quiet. Little boys praise for being bold and confident. Little girls are even told to shrink themselves in order to accommodate for the others. Little boys are just told to be brave. Even in 2025, girls in many parts of India still get to hear this from their parents, their supposed modern parents that say, ""Of course, we'll send her to school, but not too far. She should totally focus on her career, but not too much because she still has a career to manage. You see, this pressure builds. It builds every day, and it destroys dreams before they're even formed. So, what do we do? Let's stop telling women to fix themselves and start fixing the system. Firstly, let's redefine leadership so empathy, collaboration, and emotional intelligence are seen as strengths, not weaknesses. Let's rebuild hiring practices. So, you aren't judged based on your future family plans, clothing choices, or how likable you are. Let's create workplaces where women and all underrepresented groups feel safe, valued, and valued and heard. Let's start these in our classrooms. Encourage the girls to speak up, to take risks, and normalize failure. Encourage our boys to value fairness and equality, not just competition and control. Because equality doesn't start in a boardroom. It starts with how we raise the next generation. This isn't just about CEOs and high-rise glass skyscrapers, luxury cars. This is about women in in our everyday life. The women in our life. Indian women carry so many expectations. They're expected to manage their household, take care of the kids, all while having a job. More often than not, women give up their ambitions to women give up their ambitions for the for the greater good. For some, this is a choice, but for most, it isn't. Let me tell you all about a story about someone who's really close to me, my aunt. She started working at the age of just 16 and by 18 she was in Dubai in a small spa scrubbing floors and washing feet. One day she overheard the business owner saying that he was looking to sell because the business was going bankrupt. Of course, uh my aunt had great ideas to save the sinking ship. However, she had no financial backing. She was young, female, and had no credit history. Fair enough. Eventually, she got the money with the help of her family. Fast forward 10 years. Now she owns multiple branches across the country and hires other women. She created opportunity when there was none. She carved out her own table and pulled up chairs for the others. Similarly, there are hundreds there are women who have changed the entire game and defied the odds. Take Falgari Naya for example. The founder of Nika created the company at 50. Today she's the biggest today Nika is the biggest beauty brand in India. Kiran Mazmadasha founded Bio Bio Bioon and her garage. Today she's a bioon pioneer. Even globally, Whitney Wilford created Bumble so women could make the first move. Rihanna, yes, the singer built Fendu Beauty to represent all skin tones because she knew what exclusion felt like. Unfortunately for hundreds of women who succeed, there are thousand others who don't. Their dreams are dismissed, silenced, and buried under the weight of bias. Let's not forget about the young ones though. Thresha prahu at the age of 13 invented rethink a tool to prevent cyber bullying. girls even at this moment are are launching baking businesses, coding clubs and and learning trade all from their bedrooms. Imagine what they could do if the world didn't limit them. So silencing women and acting like it's not a problem is not survival. It's not progress. That's just survival. Bravery isn't always loud. It's about showing up in places again and again that weren't made for you and choosing to stay. So today, I want to ask you, what would our world look like if every girl with a dream was told, ""Yes, we see you, we hear you, and we fully support you. What would our economy look like if half of the sky wasn't missing, but fully shining?"" This starts with us. with the conversations we have, with the people we uplift, with the leaders we choose, with the changes we demand. Because the future of business and of our world is not just women, it's not just men. It's equal, fair, and beautifully ours. Thank you.",1

No, just kidding. I won't do that. But what if I did? Would people just forget about it? Or would it be the most embarrassing things that happened to my life? You know what? Sometimes life feels exactly like that. You want to run away, but deep down you know that running away won't fix anything. And that's when you face the big choice. Do we stay or do we run away? Well, that question brings me to the bigger question. When life doesn't go your way, when life goes wrong, what will you do? You've got three choices. You live with it. You try to change it or do you blame the fate for it? Well, I know most of us have felt all three. For me, I've blame the fate, too. When I fail at something, I would say things to myself like, ""It's not my fault."" Maybe the universe just hates me. And that's easy for me to say that because I think that blaming the fate is easier than taking action. But according to a French philosopher Jane Paul Sarte believed that we are condemned to be free. He believed that we as a human are not born with a fixed purpose. We're not born with a fixed destiny unlike object you know like a knife it's made with a fixed purpose it made for cutting things but human are made with human made for themsel to define themsel for what human are made to take their own choices to take their own action so What if we're just go with the flow? If we are just go with the flow, it's like we're going on a river with no paddle. Going wherever the current takes you. Comfortable maybe. But is it meaningful? I'm not sure. Well, you keep moving. Sure. But you don't choose where you're going. And maybe one day you might look up and think about it. You might wonder, wait, how did I end up here? And how can I change the direction? But then if you pick up the paddle, you can choose wherever the direction you want to go. And there is when the change comes in. Changes are scary but powerful. Changing things is hard. We need to face your fear breaking pattern and sometimes we disappoint people who expect us to stay the same. But change create new chance and that small change matter. Why? Because there's this one tiny thing called the butterfly effect. is from a scientist called Edward Lawrence where it came from the early 1960 where Lawrence once trying to predict the weather with a computer. Then he changed a tiny bit of the number and round it off a little and suddenly the computer show a whole different outcomes. And there is when he realized a small chance that we make can make a big difference with that. It teaches us that maybe a small tiny decision that we make can lead to the biggest outcomes. For example, you skip one study session and then it leads you to a bad grade. But then you switch your study area. You meet new friends. One of them become your best friend and one of them somehow can become your future boss. See a small spark today can be fade later. In my experience, one I joined a public speaking club at my school even though I was really scared but then they gave me a permission to speak. I almost said no, but then I said yes. And that small yes brought me here in this stage with you all as my audience. And that's what we call the butterfly effect. It's not just a scientific things. It's a reminder that our tiny choices can lead to the biggest outcomes. So which is it? Is our life determined by our choices or by our fate? A philosopher called Baroo Spinosa once said that our life is like a script. So is it like page 10 successful page 23 heartbreak page 45 plot twist. Is it like that? Well, it's comfortable to think like that. It's comfortable to think that the universe already know the ending. But what if we are not just the actor of our story? What if we're also the writers? What if we also the director of our own movies? So in the in the at the end, maybe I could have just ran off the stage. Maybe that could be fate. But instead, I chose to stay. I speak and I change. And here I am sharing this with you all. Well, at the beginning, I joke about running away. You remember, right? But then maybe I could have let the fate win. But by choosing to stay, I learned something new, something important to me. That maybe the fate writes our script. But it's our choices that gives it a meaning. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for listening. I'm Akila.",1

At first, these moments feel random or even like a setback. But what if I told you they might actually be the beginning of something greater? That's the idea of a butterfly effect. This idea comes from the science of complex systems. In the 1960s, meteorologist Edward Lawrence discovered that small differences in initial conditions like a butterfly swing flap could alter weather patterns weeks later. In other words, small causes can have big effects just like in our lives, relationships, and the world around us. Now, I know what you're thinking. I'm just one person. What difference can I possibly make? We live in a world where social media and cable news constantly show us problems that feel too big. Climate change war injustice and it's easy to believe the individual doesn't matter. Now, but researchers Nicholas Chryus and James Power discovered that small things like habits, emotions, and kindness spread through social networks up to three degrees of separation. This means you your choices can not only affect your friends but their friends and even their friends friends. And and here's an example. Gre Greta Thunberg was just a teenage girl protesting and go on climate change and that led to millions of people to follow her and protest. And that tiny ripple, it goes in both directions through action and through silence. Like the butterfly, your absence will be felt in ways you can't imagine. Even doing nothing, it creates ripple effects. Now, here's a real example. Before her success, JK Rowling was just an unemployed single mother living on public assistance. Then the idea of a young wizard popped into her mind. She didn't have a book deal or fame or even money. That tiny spark became Harry Potter, a global story that inspired millions. The series has sold over 600 million copies and has been adapted into eight successful movies. Have you read the third edition? I really liked it. Now, let me share one of my sparks. Back in third grade, I started journaling. At first, I wrote small things like math tests was hard. I felt nervous. But slowly, I started asking questions. Why was it hard? Did I study enough? Was I pretending I understand fractions? That habit helped me slow down and understand myself better. Later on, I picked up the guitar. I didn't have a goal. I just liked how it sounded. At first, I couldn't even hold a single chord properly, but I kept going. A few minutes a day turned into a few songs, and eventually it became a way to focus and express things I couldn't always put into words. The butterfly effect doesn't happen in one day, but over time, even small bad habits and mistakes can build into a storm you can't escape. This is explained by what economist Alfred Econ called the tyranny of small decisions. when small individually reasonable choices accumulate over time and lead to unintended often harmful outcomes. For example, a 30-year longitudinal study by the Finnish Institute for Health and Warfare found that repeated unhealthy behaviors like smoking, inactivity, poor diet drastically increase the risks of chronic diseases and mental health disorders later in life. It's like raindrops falling. They're quiet, unnoticed until they flood the whole landscape. By the time the storm hits, it's too late. And it's hard to trace back to one moment because it was many moments combined. Before Harry Potter became a global story, it was just a thought JK Rowling had on a train. Before I ever stood here speaking, I was just a kid writing about my feelings in a journal and struggling to play a single chord on a guitar. None of these seemed important at that time, but looking back, these moments carried more weight than we realized. So what choice will you make today that your future self will thank for? Thank you.",1

Maybe your classmate constantly got better scores than you. Or maybe your sibling continuously got praised and you didn't. This feeling of helplessness is no stranger to anybody. These demeaning little annoyances if continuously experienced snowball into this butterfly effect which leads to major consequences in the future. This effect in psychology is called learned helplessness. So what is it anyway? Learned helplessness is a state in which a person after continuously experiencing uncontrollable bad situations believes that they have no control over their current circumstance even when chances to change it do arise. Sort of like a butterfly effect in which small tiny little changes if continued can cause and lead to major changes. So where's the scientific proof for this? You say how's this not just some baseless psychological theory? Well, in 1967, an American psychologist named Martin Seligman performed an experiment. He put dogs into three groups. Now, dogs in group one, they were simply put in a harness and later released. The dogs in group two and three, they were given these slight electric shocks as stimuli. But for dogs in group two, there were this there was this lever in which they could pull and stop these shocks. But for group three, that lever was inaccessible. So to the dogs in that group, the shock seemed inescapable and uncontrollable. Later on, all dogs were given these shocks and group one despite having not experienced this was managed to escape with the level revol. And the dogs in group two, they managed to escape as well. But group three, despite there being a way to stop this, they simply sat down and whined whenever the shocks came. next. Yeah. Uh, but they're just dogs, right? Where's this scientific proof where they're just dogs? It can't be compared to humans, right? But despite that, there's still plenty of real life examples of this effect happening. Maybe a student, after failing numerous times on their tests, believes that it's a useless endeavor to study. Or maybe someone in an abusive relationship feeling trapped and in un and unable to leave despite there being chances to do so. Or maybe a smoker after trying many many times to quit, believes it as a useless endeavor because they failed. Now let's take this a little closer, a little more personal. Take me as an example. When I was in elementary school, I was surrounded by extremely smart classmates. They all got straight A's. They won competitions. They earned awards. Belittleled me. Well, sure, I was fine. But after seeing everything my classmates did, I felt discouraged. So I simply closed it by with my talents. I never tried to aim higher, never tried to win any competitions and never tried harder. Now you all must be wondering is there any way to overcome this effect to undo this learning of helplessness and make a change for the better? Well, there are a few ways now. First of all, we should always focus on what we can control instead of what we can't. Once more, I will take myself as an example. Later on, the final year of elementary school rolled around, and I knew I had to focus this time. No more lamenting over a simple grade difference between me and my friends. So instead of doing that, I focused on what I could change and what I could control. My own grades, my own studies. I studied harder to get into the junior high school that I wanted. And now here I am following a program organized by my first choice junior high school delivering this speech in front of you all. But besides that, we can counter the effects of learned helplessness with good tiny consistent habits that we do every day. We have to study every day, even if just one question answered. Or maybe we can write every day. Write that story even if it's one sentence every day. Make progress on that project even if it's 1% every single day. If you practice this tiny consistent good habits every single day continuously, it'll pay off in the coming weeks, months, and even years later. So, learned helplessness is one of these effects where it stems from tiny continuous little changes. So, what's interesting about it is that it can be changed and countered in just the same way. During this speech, I put tiny little droplets of food coloring in this bowl. These tiny consistent little actions change the whole thing. Now it's not clear water anymore. It's red. So that goes to show, right? Consistency can go a long way. Whether it be good or bad, like the butterfly effect in which a tiny little butterfly flaps its wings can either cause a destructive tornado or with turbines to power cities.",1
V5Mnviy6JTM,The Power of Silence! | Ms. Kavya Rawal | TEDxYouth@JGIS,"What if silence wasn’t a void — but a voice?

In this deeply moving and introspective TEDx talk, RJ Kavya Rawal, a well-known radio jockey, explores the profound impact of silence in a world that never stops talking. As someone whose life revolves around sound and conversation, she shares how her greatest lessons didn’t come from what she said — but from what she didn’t.

Through real on-air experiences and honest reflection, RJ Kavya reveals how silence can heal, connect, and humanize us. She reminds us that in the rush to say more, do more, and post more, we often forget the beauty of simply pausing — of truly listening.
 “Because silence isn’t the absence of sound… it’s the presence of meaning.” Kavya Rawal is an accomplished radio professional, voice artist, and content creator based in Ahmedabad. With a background in Psychology and Mass Communication & Journalism, she combines academic insight with a natural flair for storytelling. Kavya began her career as an evening show host at Fever 95 FM and now hosts the popular morning show on 104 Mirchi Love Ahmedabad, where her distinctive voice and engaging style connect with thousands of listeners every day. She has interviewed celebrated figures across film, music, sports, and digital media, and has anchored numerous high-profile events. As a seasoned voice actor, Kavya has lent her voice to thousands of ads, films, and campaigns. A guest lecturer, competition judge, and prior TEDx speaker, she continues to inspire audiences with her authenticity, resilience, and dynamic presence.

Good, good, good evening. My name is Clavia. What a lovely evening to be here. What a great great great event. So many amazing people out there. I see a lot of familiar faces. I see a lot of beautiful students. How amazing is that? Let me stay silent for a moment. I don't talk like this. Everybody I meet, they get to know I am a radio talkie. All they want me to do is speak like a radio talkie. Radio talkies do speak, but radio talkies also stay silent. Today we are going to talk about the power of silence. How important is it? How amazing is it? How necessary is it? And at the same time, how unnecessary is it? Talk about relationships. That silent treatment, right? I'm sure all of us we have done that. I'm very much single at the moment. I have not done that. There's a noise that was unnecessary noise, right? Never mind. We are going to talk about a lot of amazing things. Monu's what does it mean? Silence is a great source of power. Powerful are those people who can be silent. Powerful are those people who can be silent at times where they wish to speak, where they want to speak, but at the same time they chose to be silent. There have been times when I wanted to sleep but I did not. Why did I not have the chance to speak? The answer is no. I have all the chances to speak but I do not. We should be valuing emotions in this world of social media coming from a social media creator herself. I saw it on my standby outside. I am also a creator. Yes, I am. But creators also need to be silent at times. I'm sure all of us right here. We use a lot of social media. We want to pick up our phones, put something on social media. You felt something bad, you should. You felt something good, you should. But at times, as everybody has heard and said at times, silence is really powerful. We should be staying silent at times. Well, I will not be silent. It is my bread and butter button to speak. So, I need to speak. Here we are. The illusion of silence. Relationships. With a show of hands, can I see how many people are here in a relationship? Wow. I see my people. Lovely. Lovely. Great. I'm sure a lot of people have given them silent treatment in relationships. Is it necessary? Yes, it is. Being somebody who has done professionals with psychology, I understand how important it is to stay silent at times. Unfortunately, we don't really understand that our words hold a lot of power. They hold a lot of amazing things. But at times it's really important to understand that our science is equally important and it's equally beautiful. Let's come to the second professional science. I'm sure everybody here is working. They have a business. They have their own thing going on. What if a lawyer stays silent? Would he be able to work? Yes. No. We can speak. That's fine. It is going to go on YouTube. That's not right. What if a lawyer stays silent? Will he be able to work? No. Right. Of course. But what if a lawyer stays silent in front of a client? He will be able to work and increase his fees at the same time. See the power of silence. I will be having a lot of jokes. They are also my bread and butter. So, let's also talk about that. Let's talk movies. Any Bollywood fan here? >> Bollywood fans. I see a lot of fans. See a lot of fans. Amazing. I'm sure there are so many songs out there. You've seen the word. So let's talk about movies. Let me talk about movies because that is my background. Also, I meet a lot of celebrities. There have been times when I've read celebrities. I wanted to ask them questions which would really bother them. I did not. Why? Because I chose to be personally correct instead of being professionally correct. It's important. Now, all these three points were important. But at the same time, let's talk about my experience which is really, really, really close to my heart. Every morning, I go to my office at around 7. It's 700 a.m. I have to start my show at 8:00. The moment I enter the studio, it's all silent. I have my team with me, but I want them to be silent. What finding I get a call on the landline number of my student. The person speaking I would figure out that she was somewhere in her mid30s. The moment I pick up the call she said hello. I said hello ma'am how are you? She said that I've lost someone. That really made me sad. Losing somebody is really sad. I'm sure people here have lost people. But at the same time, I had a chance. I did not choose this opportunity as my content. I could have done that, but I chose to be. Can I say what? I'm glad you are with me. It's really important to choose your silences. It's really important to understand how important it is to not speak at times. I see so many people right now going on social media. I see so many people bashing people on social media. Somebody from our panel they ask me that don't you get trolling on social media? I am a social media creator. I do. Which is sad right? At times it is important to stay silent. I am a gentle. I have been taught to speak things out loud. I have been taught speak your mind out. You don't have to keep quiet. But at times I choose to keep quiet. Even if I don't have to, I will stay quiet because it is important. It's good to be a good human before being a good professional. Are you guys going to promise me to be that? >> Please, please be kind. It's really important in a world where everybody is trying to get content out of everything. I am a content creator. I am a radio junkie. I go meet people. I go get content out of them. But at the same time I also try and understand and pause because I'm not there professionally. I want to be there personally. I want to understand them. It's really important to meet people the way you should. It's not a very long time that we are going to be here. Please be kind. And that's all I want to tell you. Pause. It's really important to pause at times. When was the last time you sat with your own self? Can somebody tell me that? When was the last time you sat with your own self? You did. You are a lucky person because I don't see a lot of people doing that. It's really important to sit with your own self in silence with your own self. You have to pause in order to understand that you have to be here and be kind with the people that are around you. But at the same time, start with your own self. It's important to be kind to each other. So whenever I end my show, I say one thing that please, please, please be kind to each other. That's the least and the most you can do. Today as I stand here I want to request that your silence holds a lot of power. When I'm here all I want to tell you is that you need to pause understand and just remain there. It's important to be silent. Your silence holds a lot of power. There are times when you're sitting with an old friend. You have just fought with their friend. There is no ation happening and after a while you just order their favorite coffee. The fight is solved. You did not speak word. It's all silent and it's all happy. Wherever I go on my show, wherever I go on air, all I want to say is that I want people to be happy. And where I say this, I actually mean it. What does happy mean for you? Does it mean having a lot of friends? The answer is no. Does it mean having a lot of friends? The answer is no. Does it mean that I have traveled the world? The answer is still. It means that I'm happy. I'm content with what I have at the moment. It's really important to earn people than to earn money. I might not have a lot of money in my pocket right now. I'm sure I'll have a lot of people in my pocket right now. All thanks to the good silences that I have. I'm happy that I'm here today and being a radio talking. Look at the irony. I'm talking about silences. Prayers led that I will be talking about silences. When I got to know that it's silence that I wish to talk about, I was really glad because never do I get a chance to be silent on air. If I go silent on air, it is called radio silence which is not something which people look forward to. But being silent in my life at times which would really be important for me and the people I have around me personally personally I would want to be silent. Now I know this would be the shortest tech talk that But then I would want to drop the mic but quietly. I would want to practice what I preach. Thank you very much. And today as I lean I want to request you with folded hands. Please be kind to each other. That's the least and the most you can do. And please utilize your silence in the right fashion. Please make people around you happy but start with yourself. Thank you.",1

I mustn't mention any names, but I'm sure you know the ones they run with. Binder. They have the word bumblebee in it. Cupid. Now, most of the times these apps just lead to disappointment and regret. But I'd like to tell you a small story about a successful relationship that was formed online. It was between two young people, a city girl and a village boy. It all started with one chat. Eventually they started chatting more and more and after a while they hit it off. They started dating and eight years later they married and had me. My entire existence wouldn't have happened if that one chant wasn't sent My existence hinges on that one spark. This spark is akin to the butterfly effect, which states that the small flapping wings of a butterfly can cause a storm in outer corner of a world. This term, coined by meteorologist Edward Lorenz, states that in each and every complex system, the smallest variable, the smallest change, can have the largest impacts on the whole. I'd like to take our daily lives. For example. We live our lives through big and small moments. We do our routines. We wake up, we brush our teeth, we eat breakfast, and we go to work or go to school. Oftentimes we have this tendency to disregard these small routines, INS these small habits as trivial or insignificant. But these small routines are the basis that builds our progress. I'm sure each and every one of you has had goals before, and with those goals come failures. But failing is a natural part of the cycle. Just like how Rome wasn't built in a day. Progress isn't achieved perfectly. It's a curve constantly going up. Sometimes there's plateaus, there's drops. But as long as it is progressing upwards, even the smallest amount of progress is progress. There's this Japanese philosophical concept that I wish to touch upon to you is called kaizen. The kanji translation is improvement, but the full meaning of that phrase is Cumulative effort. Cumulative effort for the greater good. First used by Toyota to create more efficient employees and increase productivity. This concept can be used in our daily lives too. There are four main pillars in this concept is cycle, which is plan, do, check and act. For every routine you're going to make, of course you're going to have to plan it out, right? So let's say you want to have a better habit of reading. You should start that by doing 15 minutes each day. Fully dedicated to reading. After planning that habit, you should start doing them for a short amount of time to see those results come in to see those improvements. The next is to check check on whether you've improved or whatever you've downgraded from your previous self. The last step is ack ack on your solutions. Act on that schedule. I'd like to take an example from myself. Say last year I got into the school's Olympiad team and I didn't really have a habit of studying, but I tried as my mind. I made a small study schedule. It wasn't very demanding. It was only around ten minutes a day. But with those ten minutes, I managed to get into the National of Science National competition in Indonesia, although I only passed around city level. But that proves that even with the smallest amount of progress, you can still achieve your goals. Small increments are easily discourage. these small steps, because these progress isn't visible to our lives, isn't visible to our eyes. But I just want to make sure that even if you only do 0.1% every day, each and every day, as long as you're fully dedicated to that schedule, to that routine, it will eventually add up to something greater. Now, I want to ask you a question. Are you forever going to be locked up in your own mediocracy, lamenting on what you could have done? Or are you going to start small? Start from the smallest steps. Start from that 0.1 and ramp it up from there. Because with the smallest of steps, with the smallest of seeds, it can bloom into the greatest flowers of progress and fruits of your labor. Thank you for listening. And that's all for me.",1

Before you know you are on YouTube short and your start laughing at funny random me all in just a few minutes or so you thought. Is it trend or threat? Today I want to talk about scrolling addiction. How it can creeps into our life steals our time and reshape our attention. and what we can do to reclaim control not only of our screen but our dreams. What's happening behind your gadget screen? Your gadget with apps are not a communication tools anymore. They are learning machine. An algorithm tracks your preference, tracks your search history, learns your content. They are make a persona. They try to keep relevant to you and somehow they know what you want before you do. FYP infinite scrolling autoplay videos is designed to keep you engaged, stimulated and excited. No, what's happening inside your brain? Every single tap, every single like, every single swipe triggers your brain to activate brain's reward system. When your brain receive a stimulus which is something exciting, your brain responds it. Your brain produce dopamine. Dopamine flows into the another part of your brain. When your dopamine hit a nucleus circumbent which is happy spot in your brain, you will feel happy. You feel good and you enjoy it. When dopamine rest at prefrontal cortex which is responsible for taking action, self-control and decision making and planning. Your brain will record it. Your brain will remember it. What kind of content, what kind of activity that can give you a hit of the pine and later your brain provoke you to repeat it again, again and again. When you scroll through social media excessively, your brain is overstimulated by dopamine. It makes reduce sensitivity of happiness and then you need more dopamine to get the same level of happy. Then your brain will call you to take action again. Scrolling, scrolling and scrolling. You start addicted. You start scroll unconsciously. Scrolling is not a habit anymore. They cruise and need serious response. Let's talk about the symptom. Vision problem, insomnia, difficulty to sleep, focus difficulty, more aggressive, social isolation and zero interest in physical activity. So what we can do to fix it? There's a good news.

Second, time limit for a habit. And the third dopamine detox. screening before scrolling. Please ensure that you feed your brain with meaningful content. Don't feed your brain with meaningless content because when you feed your brain with meaningless content scrolling to become dumb scrolling and it leads you to get brain wrote. Okay.

Let me begin with a picture. What do you see? A kid with a messy room. Right. Then the mother. What do you think she says? We hear this a lot. probably like, ""Please clean up your room."" Or, ""You should learn to put your things in order."" And the kid replies, ""Okay, mom."" But then he delays again and again. We all know what happens next if your room is messy, right? You're lucky. If mom doesn't yell, sometimes she just gives an advice. But here's the thing. Behind the advice, there's a hidden purpose. A mother isn't just asking for tidiness. She wants to guide her child to learn responsibility and build good character from small habit. This is what we call the butterfly effect. Small actions that leads to large and unpredictable changes in the future. You know butterfly wings is fragile and easily broken, right? Yet in the cuary, even something delicate can trigger a chain of events that far greater than itself. The butterfly effect happens in our lives too. I experienced my butterfly effect when I was a teenager and the spark was an advice from my older sister. Back then, I grew up in a small town in central Java and had a very simple dream which was becoming an English tutor after graduating from high school. And that was it. Nothing big. Then one day my sister gave me a piece of advice. She said, ""Go study at university if you want to change your life."" I was thinking about the advice and I decided to move to Jakarta to pursue a degree. Then I did it. I chose to study human resources management as my major. But here is the interesting part. That one advice didn't just get me into college, but it triggered a chain reactions. What happened next was I became an English teacher finally. That one job opened doors for other opportunities. I became a reporter of TV stations, an editor and writer of a magazine for kids. Later I found myself working in one of the biggest mining and energy companies in Indonesia. That made me curious how could these changes happened in just six years. So I started reading about the brain and discover something fascinating. Our brain has this incredible ability to rewire itself. Scientists call this neuroplasticity. Now think of the brain as a vast network of wires. Every time we learn something new, our brain forms new connections between neurons. Neurons are the tiny nerve cells that send messages to our in our brain and body. This makes the existing neural pathways grow stronger or weaker over time. The connections that we use grow stronger while the one we ignore fade away. This whole process allows the brain to adapt, learn and change. That explains why the moment I took that advice seriously, my brain began to change with consistency and positive daily actions. You know, small advice creates new pathways that grow stronger until it shapes an entirely new visions for our life. You know, research shows that encouragement, advice, and mentoring has the same kind of transformations in people's lives. Back in 2008, scholars conducted a large meta analysis. They pulled together 173 studies from schools, workplaces, and your programs and the results were compelling. I love this fact. So, people with mentors showed better outcomes, stronger motivations, better well-being, and greater career success than those without mentors. So the result is clear that mentoring isn't just about guidance but it's about transformations not only in terms of habit character and knowledge but also the directions of someone's life. Now let's go back to that messy room story. If the kid listens to his mother advice, if he's willing to act on it persistently over time, he will be more organized and more disciplined and he will realize that one day what shaped him actually his mother's advice. Okay, here is the important part. Let's talk about it. I'd like to share with you three things I have learned along the way. The first one is this is about something they're very important. How do we change an advice into something truly life-changing? So this three things are the first one is be positive. When we receive an advice, try to be positive and see it as a sign that someone believes in your potentials, someone believes in your strength. And the second one is be open-minded. You know, uh advice might not fit your original plan, but just explore it, research it, and find best mentors to help you grow. And the third one is be persistence. Advice just words until you act on it persistently. And persistence takes hard work. clear plan for the next steps as well as the discipline to keep moving forward. Okay, before I close, I want to say that I believe these three things are the bridge that turn an advice into something extraordinary in our life. Okay. Now think about one advice that you once received from your parents, your teacher and friends. Hold it in your mind and then write it down and ask yourself, what if I take this advice seriously? What future could it open for me? If one simple advice can change my life, imagine what it could do for yours. Thank you.",1

At the same time, he highlights how individual agency, community bonds, and purpose contribute to well‐being. The talk suggests a balance: it’s not enough to have policies that function; a society also needs culture, connection, and opportunities for meaningful participation for people to truly flourish.

If you like, I can pull together key takeaways or quotes from the talk (if available) to flesh this out further. Timo Harakka is a Finnish Member of Parliament and a prominent figure in national and European policymaking. He served as Finland’s Minister of Transport and Communications from 2019 to 2023, where he played a key role in advancing digital infrastructure, sustainable mobility, and the transition to carbon-neutral transport.

With a background in journalism and a strong voice for innovation, Mr. Harakka has championed digital transformation, 5G development, and ethical AI governance across Europe. He has also been a strong advocate for climate action, pushing for smart, green transport solutions and resilient communication networks.

Combining deep political experience with a passion for future-oriented policy, Mr. Harakka brings insight into how societies can embrace technological change while safeguarding democratic values. He continues to serve actively in Parliament, shaping legislation on digitalization, labor, and the environment.

Attention is not just about getting to a book faster or reading without drifting off. It's the foundation of almost everything meaningful in life. Because without attention, we can't learn. We can't create new friendships because we're not really listening to each other. We can create art, music, even new ideas. Figuring out who we are, what we value, what matters to us. All of that requires the ability to stay present with our own thoughts. That's why I believe attention is our superpower. And right now, it's slipping away. We live in a world designed to scatter our focus. Messages beep, videos play, and ads pull us in again and again. But it's not by accident. It's by design. Big tech companies profit from every second of our distraction. So next time you're sitting down to do a task and then you're an hour deep in Tik Tok or YouTube, it's not cuz you're weak. It's because the system is set up to hijack your focus. I know this because I've lived it. Six months ago, I would sit down to crack a math problem as a preparation for an admission test. I'd sit down to study, realizing an hour has gone by, and I haven't solved a single problem. And to be honest, it was something I learned in the fourth grade. Even when I wasn't on my phone, I'd feel this constant itch like a phantom buzz in my pocket. My mind would keep drifting back. Did I miss a new real or a video? That scattered feeling soon started to bleed into everything. I soon found it harder to do activities I once enjoyed. Even movies felt long. I realized I wasn't just wasting time. I was losing the ability to stay with something while I really enjoy it. The day I realized how far this had gone was when I couldn't sit with my little sister and read her a bedtime story without drifting off. I felt guilty because I wasn't really there. That's when I realized attention is not just about school work and productivity. It's about the time you spend with the people you love, the relationships and connections you make. My attention is a valuable thing and if I don't protect it, I'm handing away the chance to fully live my life because we live in one of two worlds, real or virtual. So, what can we do about it? What works for me best is treating attention like a ritual, like combing your hair or brushing your teeth. When I study, I put my phone in another room, not just on silent, but out of reach. I'd give myself permission to do one task, whether it be reading or school work. At first, it felt impossible, but then when the timer rang, I realized I didn't want to stop. I had fallen into flow again. I also started adding offline time into my week. For me, that's reading or art. At first, I kept fidgeting around, but then the calmness came in. That's when the new ideas started to come in. And that's when I felt like myself. Our attention is who we are. If we don't protect it, we lose more than just minutes to a screen. We lose the chance to fully live our life. But if we protect it, if we resist for it, we gain back the power to do incredible things. To learn, to connect, to dream, to create. In my personal experience, my relationship with my younger sister has improved immensely. We rather live moments together than pass by them. Now, we better understand. We better communicate with each other. And these small rituals might not change the whole system, but they change me. And that's a start. So the real question isn't can we take back our focus. It's will we choose to? Because how fulfilling your life is, how great your future is going to be really just depends on how focused you are at the moment. Thank you for your time.",1

That something is bullying. Bullying isn't just teasing or joking around. It's intention. Four years ago, every day I would come home telling my mom I have been bullied. And that was nearly every day. I tried many stuff as if ignoring the stuff they said, but nothing worked. Well, I'm not the only one who got bullied. There are many other people who got bullied are getting bullied now. So, how do we change that? How do we create an environment where everyone feels seen, heard, and supported one? Well, one solution is creating a safe group. A group where students come together, share their experiences, and know that they're not alone. In this group, no one is judged. Everyone listens. People who have been through bullying can share their stories, their pain, and their strength. This group isn't about complaining. It's about healing. It's about finding strength in each other, learning how to speak up, and building a community that says, ""You matter. We've got your back."" Whether you've been bullied, seen it happen, or just want to help, this group is for you. Together we can create a space where no one feels alone. Because the first the because when we talk we heal. When we listen we support. And when we stand together doesn't stand a chance. Thank you.",1

Well, watch out friends because I, Klein, I'm about to change your life. Okay, everyone, nod your head if you think no believe you can change the world. I want everyone's heads nodding because no matter what someone says, no matter who says it, you can change the world. There's a typical day in my life. Go to school, come home, bring iPad, then split. I put a younger sister and it hurts me so much that I can only spend that much time with her. Then I do study dinner study sleep. Now, back to before, we aren't useless. We are a powerhouse fueling fun, curiosity, dreams, and imagination. Just because we frolic around or play video games way too much doesn't mean we're useless. And so we can be leaders. To be a leader, we need those qualities. Firstly, you need to believe in your dreams. Some kids dreams are full of rockets and stars while others are living in a castle with a princess. I don't know. I'm just a kid. Never mind, reader. Anyways, why do we have dreams? Aren't they just some random thing we randomly made up? No. If you think that, you should be ashamed of yourself. Dreams are little buddies that stick with you, urging you to go on. But when parents get in the way, it can get a bit difficult. Don't they tell you to do something? My dad has been trying to turn me into a doctor. But even though I say no, he won't stop. I don't blame him. He's only looking out for me. It's like when they will let you go the bushy way, but direct you into a perfect brain. So what happens if you follow our dreams? Well, those dreams turn into something bigger and you'll get more wishy lines basically. So leaders need dreams so that what they're doing is for a purpose. Well, I know I'm still searching for mine. Curiosity. Curiosity is a very powerful tool to have. Most adults these days are barely asking questions, which is where we come in. Due to our developing brains, we have one question in mind. Why? It's such a small word. They have so much power in it. And you know what they say, size doesn't matter. Since most of you don't believe me yet, it's time for some real proof. Who was when an apple fell on his head? Newton. This one word soon led to discovery of gravity. Something no one would have known was a thing if he hadn't asked why. And since we are the next generation, it's time to step our questioning up a notch. You can be a leader with imagination. Okay, I know it sounds silly. Even I can agree with that. But like curiosity, it's sharper than a sword. Let's take Japan. Little problems get the solutions just because the inventor has imagination. They can think, ""Oh, what could I do to fix this problem?"" For example, the rain stopped and umbrellas. Well, Japan's inventors used imagination and thought of umbrella dryers. Look at how convenient that is. But remember, it's not just Japan. It's kids too. Let's do a few examples. What about Louis? At the age of five, he was infected with blindness. And as a teen, he invented Braille. Something 6 million million blind people use today. And what about Chester Greenwood? He invented ears. And also Jacka. He created a life-saving test for pancreatic cancer at the age of 15. That's right. I said 50. Believing in yourself. Did you know that one in 10 Australians suffer from the fact that they might not fit in by being themselves? Well, if your class is doing something wrong, don't hang back on the slide. Step one. The main reason you won't is because you'll be called a snitch. Am I right? Well, why do you care? You did the right thing. They're the wrong ones. Okay, let's do an example. Let's say your friend is bullying someone. From experience, you'd say, ""It's okay. They're my friend. I can't just them."" But you're wrong. You have to just because they're doing something wrong. Tell them that doing something wrong in your presence will be fine and you won't do anything about it. >> So, how can believing in yourself help you be be a leader? Well, I believe it helps foster more trust for people around you and creates a message that being yourself is okay. My solution now before you doze off, let me say the last thing I need to say. I know how boring it can get listening to people talk and talk and talk. I know if I were there in the crowd, I'd be sleepy at this moment. There's not much I can do. I know that. But raising awareness and making or joining new moon leadership clubs is as big as a step as the first person to step on a moon. Okay, that might be a bit of exaggeration. Anyways, I could also write newsletters and student forums. I would love to have others join and thank you for listening.",1

Um, in the tradition of TED, I know that we usually get right into the speech, but I wanted to just take a moment to really thank the the teachers and the organizers for giving me the opportunity and the reason to come back to my ultra matter altra alma matter my school after 28 years. It's it's really a pleasure to be stepping back on this ground and to be sharing wisdom, which sounds very old by the way, but yeah, I hope I hope the little minutes that I'll be sharing with you today will inspire you on the lessons and the journeys that I've known. So, yeah, three words, brave, kind, and wise. What does this mean? So, as I was mentioning, exactly 28 years ago, I was sitting where you were sitting in this demonstration room where the chairs flipped up and I was about to graduate. And in those times, we went through this incredible examination called the entrance exam where one day we'll decide the journeys of your life. And you know how that works, right? 28 years ago entrance exam. Yeah. So, um you go through this fear about what I've done through my life would lead to this moment and would the choices I've made be the right one and would it make me happy? But I can certainly tell you this in your life. You're going to be going through a lot a lot of choices, a lot of path, a lot of fork in the road because life is not a Tik Tok video. Life is actually like a very long Korean series. Life is actually a very, you know, a trilogy. Life is actually a very long novel with many twists and turns and many roads to take. But with each chapter, you learn something and that's something that you have to embrace. But what I learned is that there's always three things that you should take with you throughout these journeys in your life. First one, courage. The courage to be brave. Oops. Is my mic still falling? This these ISO max are always a little bit difficult to function. Am I okay? You're still with me? >> Okay. Courage to be brave. And courage to be brave doesn't mean you're not afraid. It means being able to face your fears, right? Being able to know that what you're going through doesn't feel right. and then exercising that courage, the courage to be changed. I'll tell you my first story. So, right after that entrance exam, that one exam that changed your life, I went into law school, four years of law school, two more years of master school of law in the in the US. I went to a top 10 um law school in the US. I don't know why I dropped that. I went to Northwestern. But actually, I just wanted to share with you that. So, after Northwestern, I went into legal practice for another five years and that was 10 years of legal experience. At the beginning, it was exciting enough. You know, I got I got to help people. I got to convey my points. I got to stand, I got to make speeches, but more on a parallegal terms, you know, it was on paper. So after a while, I felt that it didn't really quite fit me, but I was already invested in my legal practice for so long. So why was I ready to make that change? Because I think that in the end, life is about having the courage to know what is right for you and to know to move on when something is not right. That's real courage. My second lessons to you all is kindness to others. I learned this again when I made the second change in my career was when I moved from being a lawyer into being in marketing and communications. It was very short-lived this marketing and communication but it was because I knew that I had a gift. I knew that I was a great storyteller. I knew that if I knew the story well, I was going to be able to tell the story in a way that others will understand. But however, after a while, you begin to realize that you might need change just because you need excitement. And that's when I hop to HR, human resource. It might not sound the most glamorous or the most prestigious, but I can tell you that it could be very re rewarding. In marketing, you tell stories. In HR, you listen to them. And that's when I learned, oh, by the way, I moved into HR right before COVID 19. Maybe you don't remember but COVID 19 was the day when the world was under a great certainties and people put a lot of resemblance on leadership on leading three people through crisis and that's when I learned that the best leaders are not the one with the brightest idea or the the one that has the smartest grade on the paper but they were the ones that listen. They were the ones that listen with their eyes, their ears, and their heart because then they would know that who is going to be helping them on this teamwork journey to pull us through. And I realized that the leaders who were the great listeners were the ones that people wanted to work with. They were the ones that the people wanted to talk to and they were the ones that people were willing to work walk along with. So I take this with so take this with you. Kindness with empathy listen with an open heart will open doors for you and take you great places. And last wisdom of knowing. Wisdom from knowing doesn't mean that you need to know everything. But it means that you need to have this consistent journey of wanting to learn. Knowing that there is a world out there for you to learn, to explore, to be inspired, to be absorbed, and also to discover. Because when you have the knowledge, you will know what is right and wrong for you. And that's when you're able to make judgment on what will make you happy. I I leave this picture up here. I don't know if we still have what we called English excerpts books, right? That those were back in the days. But this is my one of my favorite book. It's Wizard of Oz. Maybe you know it by the formerly revamped story of Wicked, but it talks about this girl Dorothy, this young women rising. She was going through a journey and she met three males. The lion, the Tin Man, and the Scarecrow who wanted to have courage, who wanted to have a heart, and one who wanted to have a brain. because each of them thought that with this one particular attributes all their problem would be solved. But in the story as the story goes Dorothy discovered that the three attributes of courage to be brave, wisdom from knowledge and kindness from the heart is really what got her through and what got her friends through. So girls, I leave you with this. As your journey goes through life, I hope you have the wisdom to know what is right and wrong from you for you. I hope you have the courage to take actions to change. And I hope you have the kindness and empathize and be there for your friends and your family and those that cares to take you along on your journey. And most importantly, the world doesn't need any copy. The world needs you. The brave, the kind, the beautiful you. Thanks girls.",1

You're woken up by the sound of a church bell in the middle of a grim village. The year somewhere around the 1200s. You're wearing a t-shirt and jeans with a useless phone with no internet. There's no electricity or nothing of the ordinary and you're definitely not prepared. Welcome ladies and gentlemen to medieval England. Can someone from our time really survive back then? And what will it teach us about our own time? For starters, knowing a few old English phrases would be a big help. Slay me. Don't kill me. Or not. I'm not a witch. What about food, you ask? If you're not a nobility, expect bread, bread with soup, bread vegetables, and occasionally bread on top of bread. Medieval society ran on the feudal system, which means your day-to-day life would greatly depend on your social class. If you've ever played chess, you would know that the king is one of the weakest pieces on the board and relies on the support of others. Much like medieval monarchs who depended on knights, nobilities or peasants. During this time, much of your daily life will be devoted to the church. Beyond a place of worship, it functioned as a powerful institution that guided daily routines, oversaw laws and orders, and played a crucial role in shaping political decisions. In those times, your biggest threat wouldn't just be the bad hygiene, but also the thriving diseases. With the bubanic plague just around the corner, and you better hope there's an extra mass in your pocket since tuberculosis was responsible for claiming countless lives during those times. Infant mortality, complications during birth, and other infections were also an everpresent danger. In those times, medicine relied on superstition, religion, and belief or treatments such as herbal remedies, blood letting using leeches or drilling holes in your skull. All practiced without sanitation or anesthesia. In those times, falling ill meant certain death. While today modern medicine allows most people to survive diseases and infections that once wiped out entire communities, providing treatments, surgeries, and vaccines. In the meantime, society has also changed in ways that most of us barely even notice. Regent social hierarchies once controlled every aspect of life. But now most of us take for granted the freedom and opportunities that were once reserved only for the elite. In seconds we do what it took entire centuries to build, discover or conquer. Power flows through wires, water flows through pipes, and information travels instantly across the globe, most without having to lift a single finger. Today we can carry the entire world in our pockets. But to our ancestors, it would have been pure sorcery or just bending the laws of nature itself. Still, countless of problems remains to be unchanged. Rigid social hierarchies continue to determine who thrives and who struggles, while poverty, discrimination, and injustice shapes far too many lives. People still die from preventable diseases and access to care is often limited by wealth, location, or systemic neglect. We still live in a world where gender besides paychecks, power, or even safety, where sexism gets brushed off as just a joke. It's not progress when women still have to fight to be heard. And now Your worth isn't built on skill or effort. It's built on cloud, likes, and followers. People sell their dignity for a digital applause feeding an algorithm that will never love them back. As we remember how far we've come, we must also face how much remains unchanged and how fragile our progress truly is. History isn't just what's behind us. It's a prophecy of what's to happen if we don't commemorate the past. We're bound to repeat it. Every every mistakes we deny is a warning we waste. Every every truth we contradict weakens us. And every sorry, injustice grows when we do nothing. Freedom slips away when we fail to protect it. and system falls apart when we look the other way. If we don't face what's coming, the same mistakes will hit us all over again, harder than ever. The question isn't if it will happen, it's whether we'll do something before it's too late. Thank you.",1

So, first off, hello you guys. Just sit back, relax. If you're sitting like here, like lay back and relax because this is an inspiring talk, not an educational talk, right? It's called controlling time, managing life, and hanging tight to your goal. So, have you ever felt like this? Like you want to do everything at the same time? You want good grades, but you still want to go hang out with your friends. You still want to watch your favorite band concert, but then you know like you still have your academic like goal to achieve. This is you. You're like ready to go, but your goal is still like hanging to you like this villain pulling Superman cave. You know, sometimes you feel like you want to duplicate yourself and like do everything at the same time, but that's only delusional. It's only happen in your mind. So you might be thinking that is your time missing from your equation because you know when you have like no time you will say like I have no time. I have nothing to do. I have like no time to finish this. But in reality can I ask you like how many hours in a day? 24 right? Nobody said 25 26 or like 23. So now that you know that you can't say you have no time, we have equal time and now you and the time is like holding your hand back together. Think about your goal right now. It can be like academic goal or like for parents it can be fixing your sleep schedule or like tidying up your desk, mastering your instrument skills or like waking up early trying to do a public speaking. Okay, I'll give you like 10 seconds to think about your goal. Okay, let's grab your goal in mind and let's get started. First, I would like to change your mindset that everything takes time. You see this sign, the Michelin stars? This is a sign given to a best restaurant in like the world or the best hotel. Did they give you this like you made them katu like fried rice? Did they give you this at the first try? No. Right. It takes time. It takes time to build up your like your recipe. Build up my confidence to speak right here with you guys. Like it's like try to think of like fixing fixing your sleeping schedule. Like you sleep 1:00 a.m. every day and then you want to sleep at 10 p.m. for example. It takes like two to three days to do it. Mine takes like five months to fix from 1:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. And now I'm still like my under eye is still a panda. So it it's working. It's working little by little. Okay, this I left you with two remarks with this. First is that everything takes time. Don't pressure yourself. Just like step back, keep going like that. And second is like everything takes time. Don't rush to the last minute. Especially academic goals like for example finishing your assignment. You need time to plan. Okay, you might be familiar with this concept as a quote say Rome wasn't built in a day by John Haywood. But do you know the extension of this quote? It's called but they were ling brick every hour. So this leads to my next uh topic that one is more than none. The brick every hour is like doing one every day is more than doing nothing. It's like an effort built to achieve your goals. It's like doing one every day is better than do 99% like unstarted plan in your head. Thinking of your goal as a plan as a little plan. Do you pour like a whole bucket of water every day and expect it to grow like a tree in the middle of the building? No. Right. You have to like pour little by little water every day to let it grow. It's like your goal to achieve your goal. This is my favorite quote from M Lutter. You don't need to see the whole staircase. Just take a first step. The whole staircase is is like a you know process that finishing your assignment, waking up early like that. But you have to take the first step first. If you ready to see the process, when will you reach the top if you don't take your first step? Next mindset is over. Let's go to practical habits. First is do it now. You know everything takes time as I said but do it now. It's me like start whatever you are planning to do right now. This is me. It's not any student. This is me in the past like plenty of time and then oh oh my god only one day left and then still plenty of time you know one day have 24 hours right I'm counting down my hours like I'm counting down the new year eve like that and then missing work you see this habit of do it now can stop you from this habit can stop your procrastination and laziness can fix your habit too from the last day of work You'll be like this before like but now not only finish in time but finish before time and have one day left to view your mistake achieve better grades academic comeback. Yay. Okay. Next. Repetition. Repetition is like your action. You do it again again and then it became habits. For example, waking up early every day for like a year a month can increase your habit. Even though just like five minutes early it's early you know uh my case reading for me back then at your ages sitting there is like so struggling just like five pages of short story can like kill me like that but right now I'm in the faculty in chilongan which requires a lot of reading one week requires a lot of one book like this take up no you have to read it in one week so right now does it bother me no because I do it repeatedly only one page per day one sentence in the book per day helps me a lot achieving a goal right now I'm not struggling with reading anymore and you can do that too next is like recommendation of planning tool because planning tool help you to track your work track your process of doing things for example like this is a recommendation app but I recommend the Google calendar the most because it's linked to your mainstream and you can see the color of what you're gonna do tomorrow what are missing. Okay. Next, uh my from seniors to junior parts because I was once a student like all of you and I was once in a stage where I'm like have nothing to to do. You know, I have no plans in a day. Take this as like a tap on your shoulder, not a scope from your parents. Because all of the idea I get from this talk is from my mistake, from what my parents always told me to do. take every opportunity and try everything. For me, I apply as a candidate for a class president and look what I am now. I got the position and now I am the my faculty president of my year. So, no need to cl opportunity. It can practice your soft skill, your hard skill, every skill like this. I really like this quote from the uh series The Office. You miss 100% of the shot you don't take. If you don't take it, it's over. It can practice your hard skill, soft skill. Like my friend Mey said, going to Quadball team, try it out. You can practice your hard skill in your sports. Standing here talking TED talk like you guys, you can practice public speaking, right? It can gain you opportunity to meet new people, new friends and also build immunity for your future world like being tired and then you come back and said oh I did this before I can do it and you do it. Next problem is your perspective. I think problem it from the dictionary it's mean like struggling like that but I think that's the phrase your mind builds you to think that it's a problem. Think about Romeo Juliet and every novel we read. Without a strict dad and without like Juliet drinking a poison and die, would it be fun? Would it be Shakespeare today? No. Conflict build fun in life. Will it as a experience and a color of life more than a struggle you like a rock you fail every day? Will it as a color and walk past it? Thank you.",1

Like most children, I started to chatter in my native language of Thai since the age of two. Most parents starting to introduce their children into another foreign language, which would be English, the most popular because of how globally used it is. But for me, it started with Mandarin as my first ever learn foreign language. Well, it's not this kind of Mandarin. Of course, it's the language that the Chinese speak with complicated writings and weird tonal pronunciations. Both Thai and Mandarin are tonal languages, so I kind of like have an upper hand on learning um the Mandarin very well. Most of the time I would be quizzed on how to pronounce animal names or fruit names by my mom using many colorful flashcards. Every night three-year-old me would messed up in pronunciation in a lot of ways. For example, the word my. How would a foreigner first pronounce this word? they would probably just pronounce it in a straightforward tone like my or something. But in Chinese and Thai, in Thai, we have five tonal pronunciation and in Chinese four. For example, the word my in Thai that means no. My in Chinese that means to sell something. But in an opposite pronunciation in Chinese, my is to buy something instead. One of the perks of diving deep into learning uh learning a language is how much it supercharges your communication skills. Not only does it lead you into the reach of native level fluency, but also it helps us to become more effective and precise communicators. When you wrestle with your new tongue, you incredibly turn into all those little details while learning a language. The tones, the feelings, and even the cultural vibe behind those words. When you carefully little by little build up the grammar, structure it in a perfect way and know a variety word of vocabs, you starting to absorb and process information quicklier like you have become one of the locals. Every new skill learning especially for learning a language starts from memorizing. Little by little you memorize each word that slips into your ear or from your mentor. The hippocampus one of the part important part of the brain that includes with um the long-term memories and short-term memories. It converts the short-term memories from from multiple times of practicing into long-term ones. Before you know it, you will have a variety of word bank synonyms where you can use it for essay writing in a very professional way. Once you realize on when you are fluent in a language, you are incredibly have like a superpower. Any foreign phrase that slip into your ear, the brain immediately translate into something you automatically understands without thinking much. The sorry, the constant workout between switching between the mother tongue and the foreign tongue enables us to boost for cognition. Not only does it strengthen one's muscle memory but also to improve one's ability of analytical thinking. It not only also improves one's mental agility but opens a unique window into how others can see the world. Because language is deeply tied with culture, I would say that learning it helps us to understand different people's perspective better. When you have this understanding, it foster empathy inside a inside an individual, breaks down the cultural barriers between two foreign people, and enriches deep appreciation in cultural diversity within the community. Right now, a lot of businesses seek for collaboration across borders and trying to expand their companies into a wide variety international market. The demands for interpreters or highskilled multilingual people are higher than ever because these people plays a vital role into bridging the cultural gaps. The cultural misunderstandings can be hap that can be happen within two different cultures and that can lead to a long-term professional success in uh in the company. Yes, understanding how different cultures under understanding how different cultures think can open a gateway to new business ventures and help in building up one's country economy a lot because like USA we have a lot of collaboration with that country as well. it will build up the economy very fast. Now, not hurting if one day you want to move out of Thailand and live in another country where that suits your preference even more. Like for example, if you're a winter loving people, can I see some hands of like people who have their favorite season as winter a lot? like you see moving to maybe Switzerland or Sweden, France or even Japan and Korea. Top destinations for Thai people to go travel back and forth there during the Christmas times and the New Year's Eve. Once you realize on how much actually you know some simple phrases from those countries, it can help you when you're stuck in a situation like there's no people who speaks good English or the translator does not really help you that much because it does not uh translate what you may be really meant on that context. text the skills that I've learned from learning a language all these years. It taught me one thing and it made me be memorable in memorized in learning different more languages. Right now I'm started to learning French because like it very suits my interest in growing and expanding my new knowledge learning a language. The skill you gain from that, you carry it for life. Thank you.",1

The belief that if you visualize your dream life, speak it into existence and act as if it's already yours, the universe will deliver it. Manifestation has become everywhere from self-help books to social media videos promising you success, wealth, and happiness. But here's the real question. Does it actually work on its own? >> Well, psychology today point out that manifestation is a just a form of magical thinking. The idea that thought alone can shape reality. Well, but with our action, most dream remain just as a dream. Right? And psychologists warned that if you rely only on manifestation, it can actually backfire you. When goal don't magically came to reality, some people may feel guilt, self-lame or even depression. Some may even neglect real solution like medical treatment or financial planning. For example, thinking that positive thoughts will eventually fix everything. So that's why planning and effort are matters. The research show that optimism and self-efficacy, the belief in yourself ability to succeed are linked to the achievement. Right? And from a neuroscience perspective, manifestation isn't just magic. It's about reinding your brain. When you focus on something you truly want, your brain start to prime itself to notice opportunities, action, and people that can move you closer to your goal. The more you think about your intention, the more you convince yourself that it's possible. And that belief doesn't just stay in your head. It's draining your neural pathway that drive your motivation and behavior. Well, Dr. Jones James Dodie called this embedding your intention or in other words, you're teaching your brain that this goal matters so much that you would literally do anything to turn it into reality. But here's the deal. Unless we act, nothing changes. I have seen this in my own life for a long time. I only wish I always admire confident people and wonder if I could ever be like them someday. I doubt myself constantly again and again. Well, I know that feeling. I once tried manifestation in a very literal way by making a vision board. Of course, a friends introduced it to me. So, I filled mine with picture of books, students studying and certificate. Well, I'll admit it. I felt a little bit shy and embarrassed at first cutting those picture out. It seemed almost silly that putting those picture on could change my future, but I want something to remind me of what I'm working toward. >> So, did it work? >> Well, at first it gave me motivation, but I quickly realized that only looking at those picture wasn't enough. Those images doesn't magically raise my grade or anything. My real progress still came from what I've always done, which is studying late, pushing through when I was tired, and refusing to quit. That's not exactly like my turning point. My turning point was being in the student council. At first, I applied into the red team, but I got placed in the purple team instead. Well, it wasn't my first choice, but it was start. I show up and kept working hard step by step and then therefore open the doors. I eventually got invited to be secretary of the red team with a path to become president. So this this experience has taught me that even when you start from where you unexpected consistent action will keep moving you forward. Well same here by grade 10 I wasn't even sure I would earn single academic certificate that year. Life had become busy and I was surrounded by my genius peers. But I remembered my vision board and thought to myself if I want those images to came to reality I need to act. So I kept going day after day and in the end I earned six certificate far beyond what I expect but and that's when I realized the board gave me vision but that my action was what turned it into reality. So both of us have have learned the same lesson in a different way. >> Yes. And here's how I see it. Manifestation without an action is just like planting a seed and expecting it to grow without watering it or giving it sunlight. Visualization can ignite passion. But only deliberate action can nature grow. Exactly. But manifestation still matter. It show us what we are truly want. So the lesson is clear. Dream vividly. Visualize your goal. But pair those dream with persistent effort and careful planning. The universe may listen to you but it definitely not going to do all the work for you. Every step you take no matter how no matter how big it is or small it is matters. Dream like a fire but action fuel the flame. Your journey toward the achievement begin with your first step and continue with every step you take after that. So we challenge you. Don't just manifest. Manifest with action. Dream boldly. Act deliberately and take ownership of your journey. For that reason, manifest means nothing without action. >> Yes. So your future is in hand to you. >> It build through the step you take after that. Thank you. >> Thank you.",1
WmWYMFQpfFk,"Lessons from Markets, Money and Human Behavior | Akhil Awasthi | TEDxIIMCalcutta","In this thought provoking TEDx talk, Akhil Awasthi explores what it truly means to redefine normal using the ever changing world of markets as a reflection of human behavior. From liberalization to digital transformation, he traces how our ideas of value, success, and identity evolve over time. Through relatable examples and reflections, Awasthi shows how change in finance, technology, and life challenges us to question our assumptions and choose whether to follow the crowd or define our own version of normal.

 Akhil Awasthi, Managing Partner at Tata Capital Growth Fund (TCGF), leads with a strong track record in Private Equity, overseeing fundraising, investing, and exits across five funds. After joining TCGF in 2009, following an MBA from Delhi University and Harvard's
AMP, Akhil has excelled in strategic investments across sectors such as IT, healthcare, and manufacturing. Known for his mentorship and big-picture thinking, he also serves on several prominent boards, including Star Health Insurance and Igarashi Motors.

As you would have gathered from my introduction, I'm from the investment side. I deal with markets as they are understood. Stock markets, equity markets, private markets and that's what I'm going to talk about. What is normal out there? How does redefining happen? And maybe a few pointers of what could be of interest to people who are not even uh keen or to pursue a career on the equity side, what they can take away from there. So let's kick this off. So just understanding the concept of market uh it's exchange an exchange of an object for another object. Conceptually you need two people to make an exchange and you need two objects. I have something that I value. You have something that you value. But both value what the other has more and therefore the exchange takes place. When multiple people are exchanging objects that's the marketplace. Now we introduce the concept of money. Money is a store of value. It is also measure by which we can exchange objects and take something today and buy something else tomorrow. So it helps facilitate uh this uh actually I should not look that side because I'm very seriously look people are very serious out there. So money is money is a medium which enables you to exchange any object. Then you have the concept of credit. You can borrow you can pay over a period of time and start using the object today. Obviously the concept of EMI you can start using a car car immediately pay for it over a period of time. Then there is a concept of asymmetric payoff. You pay a small amount today but like the lottery you can win a jackpot. So there's a concept of asymmetry. So these are all basic fundamental concepts that are part of market. The difference between market and marketplace is in marketplace there is just exchange that is happening in a market multiple people want to buy and sell the same object and the difference in value that they ascribe to that object that is what gives the price and that is what happens in share markets when multiple multiple people want to buy the same goods that's why I took some time on this slide. Now that we have come to markets, markets can be rational. Oh, we'd love to have have that happen. They have to be rational means they will be proportionate which means a positive event would have a positive reaction and a negative event would have a negative reaction. They have to be proportionate. Which means that suppose a company misses its earnings by 5% and the stock comes down that amount should be the same as if it was making its earnings by 5%. And then stock price goes up. So they have to be rational. So these are the two concepts are there. They have to be directionally same and they have to be proportionate. But unfortunately market also has moved. It has exuberance. When it is feeling happy then everything is rosy and people are willing to pay higher and higher price usually for a financial benefit but sometimes just for the heck of it. And the reason why I'm using this example is if I buy a painting which till last year was costing a million dollars but today is costing $20 million. and I buy it today. I might or might not have profit but I'm buying it because there is some emotional satisfaction for me and sometimes they are absolutely downcast. Even gold you would have seen as an up and down. People don't value gold all the time. Today is bad times for diamonds. Everybody is saying lab grown diamonds have come so real diamonds will you know should not have any value. You know three or four years ago that precious ring that was bought for you know couple of lakh of rupees today you can buy it for 20,000 rupees. So value also changes and you know today the diamond market is downcast while the stock market is up. This what is what happens when markets redefine themselves. They change the data. that changed the measure. If I talk about stock price, a 100 rupee price, you might see normal because it's been there for a long period of time. Then it goes to 110 or 120. You say, ""Okay, fine. This is now the stock is getting higher priced. It is becoming bullish."" But if the same stock was 1,000 rupees and it went up by 20 rupees the same delta absolutely 20 rupees it's nothing on a base of 1,000 rupees 20 is nothing because the datim has changed. So this is why when the markets redefine themselves, there is some critical measure that gets changed. It is not as simple as this example that I quoted about 100,000. It is more complicated than that. But this change is what redefineses the normal in the marketplace. Therefore, a moody market, not a rational market, a market that redefineses itself over a period of time. You can do two things with it. You can either be a disciple of it, which means a follower when everyone else is on the bandwagon, you also rush in. Or you can discipline the market by saying, ""No, I will be unique. I have my system. I have studied equity analysis. I know how to read profit and loss accounts. I know the industrial dynamics. I know the macro. And therefore, I will discipline this market. You can discipline the market or you can be a disciple of it. The choice is yours. Now, some history. I wanted to set the base of what we were talking about prior to this slide. And now we will talk about how BSE Sensex as a measure of equity markets performance has performed since 1991 and how and why various things have happened that have caused the market to be exuberant, the market to be redefined and specifically a few instances where the markets have crashed and therefore uh things have sort of come back to normal emotionally. uh but but never in absolute price. So the first circle is the first bull market that I saw. This is the early bull market of 1990s. 1991 we had a budget which was called the liberalization budget. I hope you can hear me because when I talk like this the mic is better but I can't speak like this. So I hope you can hear me. So 1991 we had a budget uh it was called the liberalization budget. You know suddenly uh licensing was abolished and the political events set tone for markets to be expectant of something better is going to happen. We didn't quite know what but we were certain something better is going to happen. Then the next round happened which as you can see is the second part little bit big here but the index is going from roughly about 4,500 to 5,500. So remember what had happened last time we had said liberalization has happened. We had said that price to assets is the right measure and then the market collapse. When the collapse happens the old things go out of the window. markets collapsed. Another feature that is common for both these markets was for a certain period of time brokers were heroes. Each phase I will tell you who was the hero in that market after the event happened. So in this case broker were EOS and the next event is let's say post 1995 to 2000 2003 uh it story is well known but like there are there are goods there are bad but important thing that is happening from equity markets is mutual funds in private sector had started in 93 three starting to gain scale. That's one. The second is National Stock Exchange started in 1992. More companies getting listed there. National Stock Exchange is a completely digital stock exchange. No trading physically, no settlement physically, everything was digital. You buy something through the press of a button on a computer screen. You transfer money digitally and you receive stocks in your account. So that anomaly gone. Mutual funds came in. They said we need clean accounts. So suddenly all the habit about accounts gone. You need to close accounts in a certain period of time. You had have to have them in a standard manner audited by one of the large accounting firms and present the clear picture including cash flows and then of course gradually this system of declaring half yearly results, quarterly results came in. Equity analysts gained prominence with the information coming in there. Now you had the ability to analyze the theory of stock analysis was always there discovered in the US and then adopted for India. But the equity analyst could now call out that this stock even though it is IT services is better than the other stock even though both are in the same business. So stock ticking becomes important as compared to style investing. Who are the heroes? If you look back and look at economic times or business standard of those days, you will find that fund managers are the heroes. This is the first time fund managers became heroes. But what is happening within India is that the government has started for example the national highway program. The telecom sector mobile licenses were privatized and mobile is becoming common. But economically the market got the queue. Financial markets embraced the shining theme completely. As an example, there was a new generation private sector bank uh which got started valued more than State Bank of India by the end of the bull market clearly on the exuberant side. And then of course things were happening on the side. What was happening? Interest rates rates were going up. Government was borrowing more and more to spend on various programs and gradually there was only a limited supply of money. Interest rates went up back to from sub6% to somewhere around 9 to 10%. In international market they had their great financial crisis went up. All these leverage acquisitions meant that companies started going bankrupt. Similar thing had happened in real estate and the markets came down. and then the sideways grinds 15,000 around 15,000 2008 to 2013 14 market doesn't do much so here as I was telling you wind turbine companies and you know some new generation financial services companies even though they are discredited what has come into vog is consumer companies because they are free cash positive and they are still growing so there are there are companies of uh in two wheelers high-end motorcycles for example starts going up uh even FMCG companies get a large array of their international products into India because Indian middle class is becoming bigger their turnover becomes bigger after a long time Maggi turns around Maggi has I mean Nestle has done has written articles on that so suddenly you The sector rotation has taken place. New sectors have come into place. One of them is FMCG and consumer durable sector but the market appears that it is at the same level. As an individual you could have made money by being in the right stock but at sensex level things are not. So 2013 to roughly pre- pandemic 20 decent uptake 15,000 to 40,000 in terms of scale market capitalization everything it's now and each good run the accretion to market caps is is in trillions of dollars most importantly the digital rails are established so now you can do transactions very very differently and at a much lower cost and at a much higher scale. private sector did the break of the VC funded businesses scaled up you know at the famous uh acquisition by a large US corporation of India's one of India's largest uh uh marketplaces digital marketplaces and this is the first time you know otherwise this acquisition of India based consumer business funded by venture capital was always $50 million $100 million foreigners have come and always this is the first time a billion dollar transaction has taken place and then of course the NCT provisions this is where existing businesses even uh uh the Tatas have bought companies now we are in the present 40,000 to 80,000 today I think this is the latest chart 78 925 on 8th November what is the present mode of Present mood of the market is okay. We have seen good times but we have seen better times. Nothing to worry about but yeah kind of I'm okay. I'm not not super excited and not downcast. Is economy growing? Is technology radically changing? Now the only time I have seen technology make a big difference in Indian stock market is when I talked about the n example and said that settlement became real time prices became real time otherwise technology is great you can write reports much faster much better after hearing a earnings call through chat GPT but is it making the market better superior in any manner that I don't But technology is definitely changing and it can give me new places where I can put my money. Maybe it can give me an interesting story. And you can see that if you are following the stock market that there are businesses with no profits or very minimal profits trading at over 100 times, 150 times sales. And that is because of the fundamental belief that one technology moves only one way and that is forwards. Technology moves only one way and that is cheaper. And ultimately India is a large country. Anything addressing the Indian consumer has to account for the 1.4 billion people that we we are with increasing purchasing power. And then finally what is the measure by which you would use to value these stocks. So everything has been done. I mean now you are measuring on price to sales. We talked about enterprise value to aa this market is price to sales because there is no other measure. The only real thing about these business is that there is a price and there is a turnover below that things are not clear at this point of time. So in this construct my thesis is that the Indian consumer and Indian consumer means all of you in a few months going into the job market becoming the upper middle class of India. You will decide what is going to happen to to this market with your behavior as consumers on the consumer side. This is how I think that consumers have changed. So 1990s is you know at my generation you know first get educated then get a job. Yeah. When you get a job you are a lifer. My measure of success is I become CEO of the same company that I started as a management frame after my MBA. I mean you you can look back interviews you know you can see a lot of such interviews people saying with pride that you know what this is the company I started off as management training workplace is fixed. You go to office, do your work, but when you come back home, you are home. Then there are three things that you do with your money. One is you have holiday but you go to your hometown, you meet your parents. That's the concept of holiday. The guilty pleasure is taking some time off. My routine is such that you know if I'm doing nothing maybe watching a movie a big thing that's my time off and when I take loan I'll only buy a house you should buy an appreciating asset so even my father would tell me in very stern voice which I invite totally that son only take loan when you are buying a house otherwise don't take too much hiatus and who this changed in 2005 Now education but continuous education people started taking the stamp of you know Harvard business school like I have taken advanced management program thank you for saying that that I am graduate I'm not a graduate of Harvard business school I have a certification by Harvard man uh business school in advanced management program ambition higher is bigger than loyalty changing jobs to get ahead lot more travel now because you can see private airlines have come much more easier to travel things like that trip is fivestar it's very I mean if I have to eat out now these restaurants and all are passing you go to a fivestar that is where that's how I want to celebrate my birthday loan house is okay but car is also okay now car is also defining in some way my status in Who am I? I never lose touch with my friends from college because we are all network. They are frequent alumni get togethers and of course my friend and my uh family colleagues friends all this is identity. Identity is where I work my network and my family. This is the most difficult and I am out on a limb about him. You guys know much better about the 2020s consumer. Education is now continuous. I mean even when I was asked to give this talk I looked up videos of TEDex speakers to figure out some tips education. You go for a friend's wedding, you learn a few steps. Not like our times where everybody goes gets up and start dancing and making a fool of themselves. Today people do serious or some kind of choreography and like this gym with a trainer. I want to learn I want to go to Maldives but only after I have learned scuba diving because I actually want it. So very different. There is no work life balance. I mean people want work life balance but work and home are so mixed together that it's one seamless entity. You may work for 5 hours, 2 hours homework and then 3 hours work and then you know all these things. I can't believe where are you spending or likely to spend your money on experiences. When you go for holiday experience, guilty pleasure is luxury items specifically something that can enhance your digital identity and unfortunately the cost of education has gone up. Cost of many things have gone up. So loans for education, loans for holiday, loans are reality. you're doing yourself at the same point of time at same point of time you're taking digital friends digital identity as I said as important as anything else so just coming back just remember when you look at the market the market has to have a reason to go up that's the rule it has to have the money to go up that is the money supply that is what it will take it up it has to have a measure by which it will measure the assets the stock prices it can be price to assets in one era P to growth coming back price to sales or digital market potential excuse me and finally remember money chases performance and performance chases money. What I mean by this is that once the market gains momentum more money flows in. So you just have to have enough salience in a new idea that people start noticing which is performance. And once that performance comes more money just starts coming in. And if you are in a asset management business like mine, once you have performance, once you have gained money for your clients, they will give you money. Performance chases money. Money chases performance. Performance chases money. Thank you very much.",1

So, I'm going to introduce you all to a new sport that I'm pretty sure that many of heard of. However, you may be more familiar with it than you think. Some would say that it's a combination of basketball, dodgeball, and rugby allinone. This sport is called quad ball. And the basic rules go like this. It's played in an outdoor field. There are four balls in total consisting of one quad ball, which is a volleyball, and three dodge balls. There are three hoops on each side of the field and the goal is to score through the opponent's hoops. There are four positions. Chasers, keepers, beaters, and seekers. Chasers try to score points with a quad ball. Keepers prevent the opposing chasers from scoring. Beers use dodge balls to temporarily knock out opposing players. And seekers come in later in the game and they try to catch the flag from the flagr runner, which is an official with a ball attached to the back of their shorts. And most importantly, we have to play with brooms in between our legs at all time. And as some of you may have already guessed, yes, this is Quidditch from Harry Potter. But more on quadball later. The story started all the way back when the CO 19 pandemic was at its peak. I was in 10th grade at the time and classes had to be held online. Of course, I enjoyed being the comfort of my home, but after a while, it started to get boring really quickly. And back then, I wasn't much of an outdoor person. And by outdoor, I just mean leaving the house. Even as someone who'd rather stay at home all day, I'd been craving a new adventure like never before. I'd become too comfortable and I knew that I needed to give myself a challenge. The solution to this, move to America and become a foreign exchange student. Of course. Yep, I know. Big move, especially for a home loving introvert like me. Something to note about American schools is that they are really big into sports. My school offered American football, basketball, baseball, and softball. As someone with zero sports experience, I wanted to challenge myself even further. And thus, I decided to join a school's basketball and softball team. With no trials required, I was automatically on the team. Hooray. To put it lightly, my basketball experience was not the best. I found the practices very intense. I didn't even know the basic rules of basketball. I felt overwhelmed and pressured as I was the weakest player on the team. I had trouble keeping up with my teammates and I'm always picked last. My negative thoughts started to spiral. I'm not strong. I'm not good enough. What am I even doing here? I wanted to quit so many times because it really exhausted me mentally. However, I didn't quit. As the season went on, things became less intense and my athletic abilities also improved. So, I was able to make it through the basketball season. Hooray. Thankfully, my softball experience was so much better. After all the hardship from the basketball training, softball was so much more tolerable. I learned the rules along the way and I practiced as much as I could. Despite never having even heard of the word softball, the hardship from basketball had prepared me mentally to accept the new challenge. And fast forward a year later, I am now back in the United States pursuing my undergraduate studies. And this is where I discovered quad ball. At first, I was a little hesitant about joining another sports club, but I decided to give it another chance anyway. Luckily for me, everybody on the team was super friendly and they're really fun to hang out with as well. We would invite each other to events, parties, or just casually hang out. In other words, we're like one big happy family. However, it was the inclusivity of the sport that interested me the most. This is a co-ed sport, meaning that anyone of any gender identity can participate. And a few like me don't even like sports. I was still not a particularly good athlete. Yet my team welcomed me with open arms. In fact, they all made me realize that I didn't need to be the best of the best in terms of sports. Everybody was ready to support one another and we all cared about each other regardless of our skill level. In fact, the pressure of needing to be good enough for the team for me just disappeared. And since this is somewhat of a newer and a more obscure sport, everybody needed to learn the ropes along the way, unlike basketball or even softball where some people are more familiar with the rules than others. So after another year with sports, am I a good player? No, I am still one of the weakest players on the team. I know that sports is definitely not my thing and I know that they're going to be much stronger quadball players than me and they're going to be put on the field before I do despite being newer. But that's okay. I may not be good enough to be put on the field, but I'm getting a little better and better every practice. And I wouldn't be if I didn't join the quad ball team in the first place. So, what do you think I learned through this experience? One, don't strive to be perfect, but strive to be proud. Nobody is perfect or ever will be. So instead of aiming to be flawless, aim to be a better person than yesterday. The way I like to think of it is this. Picture yourself a year back looking at you right now, as well as all the things you've achieved so far. And then keep aching yourself down further and further as much as you'd like. And you can do this as many times as you want as well. And just admire your current selves and how far you've come. From this day forward, continue to inspire yourself to become someone that makes you proud. Two, embrace hard things because you know it will change you for the better. I have a confession. I don't like public speaking. Just four or five years back when I was still studying at the school, I would have never imagined myself giving a TEDex talk because I knew that I wasn't the best English speaker in my class, nor was I the most confident student. In class, teachers would show as many TED talk videos, and I would think to myself, ""Wow, those people are so confident. I can only wish to speak as perfectly as they do. Is this TEDex talk hard to do? Oh, absolutely. But is this TEDex talk perfect? There is no such thing as perfect. However, I am really proud to be sharing my experience with you all right now. And I know that my younger self is going to be really proud to know that I'm standing in front of the big red sign. So, what makes quad ball so magical? After a year of running around with broomsticks in between my legs, what did I learn? Well, if there's anything that you've been wanting to do or if there's an opportunity offered to you right within your grasp, then just just do it and take your chances. If you know that you'll be able to take on the challenge, then give yourselves the challenges that you will be thankful for. And remember, continue to make yourself proud and let you become the best version of yourself. Thank you very much.",1

Have you ever popped double the dose of ibuprofen at the slightest sign of a headache? Or have you ever failed to finish the entire course of your antibiotics? Although these two practices are quite common, they can lead to resistance. Since I'm going to be on the front lines of this battle in the future, I want to start to make an effort right now in fighting antibiotic resistance in particular. Now, you may ask, why has this become such a big problem all of a sudden? Well, actually, antibiotic resistance has been around since antibiotics were first introduced as a treatment option. But it is only recently that the problem has been starting to get out of hand. Now being considered an official global concern by the World Health Organization. In regards to agriculture, which may seem insignificant and distant to us, but I promise you it is anything but that. In the farming industry, antibiotics are used excessively for grow promotion and weight gain. A cause for concern is that this practice is utilized widely in lowincome communities and so developing countries. So how does this affect us? I'm sure almost everyone in this room consumes pork. Pigs that are raised in these conditions have traces of antibiotics embedded into their fat layer. To think the delicious fatty part of a steak someone may be having may be making them resistant to a lifesaving medication. I first became intrigued by this topic from my research with a Thai university. My research was on the efficacy or the effectiveness of the non plan on interroccus vealis a bacteria. One of the more notorious aspects about this bacteria is that it is found in nocomial infections. Infections that are found in hospital environments. To think that even in seemingly sterile and clean environments like hospitals, this bacteria manages to survive and even thrive enough to infect patients and cause complications. To add insult to injury, enterus vealis is resistant to several antibiotics, ones I would choose not to mention in his talk because that would simply take too long. This resistance turns a simple routine surgery recovery into a debilitating process with risks of serious infection. One of my concerns that I recognized is the contrast between some countries in the usage of antibiotics. While in some countries physicians are more strict or tenacious in the prescription of antibiotics while in other nations antibiotics are prescribed pretty regularly and some are even available to be purchased over the counter in certainarmacies. The frequent and unregulated use of these antibiotics could be exacerbating the rate of antibiotic resistance in that particular region. Now, I'm sure your next question would be, ""How does this even affect me?"" Well, in hospitals, when a person comes in with a bacterial infection, the most standard approach of care would be to prescribe them an antibiotic. However, if that antibiotic if that bacteria is antibiotic resistant, the treatment options for that infection would decrease exponentially, giving more time for the infection to spread and for more complications to arise. Now imagine yourself on that patient bed. Your doctor is telling you sympathetically that need to change out your long list of medications for the nth time for a new equally long one in hopes of clearing out your infection. This repetitive, draining, and discouraging process is something I do not wish upon anyone. But sadly this is the reality of some people living with these unrelenting infections. Basically my goal in speaking today is to bring awareness to this silent growing problem. So tell your friends, tell your family, tell everyone. We need to bring awareness to this massive issue before it is too late. I don't want to imagine a world where a simple cut or scrape could imply serious complications or even death. And I'm sure you do not want that as well. Thank you.",1

My name is Samiha Anisa from class nine Ajax. And today I would like to take you all on a journey of not just something that you can see around you, but rather a journey through the human mind, the science from the eyes of education, the science behind how our brains learn, remember, focus and stay motivated. It's about understanding the human mind so we can design education in a way that truly works. Today, I would like to talk about five major psychological challenges in education and solutions that can transform how we teach and how we learn. Like this. The first challenge forgetting One day I was sitting in my class listening to a lesson about a topic that I had never explored before. At that time, I found it really interesting. I was engaged in the learning and I found the facts easy to remember. A few hours later, I could still recall most of it, but two days later, when my teacher was reviewing the lesson and asked me a few questions, I stood up with a clueless expression on my face. And at that time, I was really confused because just two days before, the information was buzzing about in my brain. But then it had just vanished. Was it because I wasn't smart enough? Or could it be that our minds don't learn the way our classrooms always teach? In the late 1800s, German psychologist Hermann Ebbinghaus conducted experiments on himself to see how quickly information fades. His research produced what is now known as the Forgetting Curve, a steep downward slope showing that within just 24 hours of learning something new, we can lose up to 70% of it if we don't review it. Imagine pouring water into a leaky bucket. That's our brain when we don't reinforce our learning. And that's exactly what happened with me. But why did it happen? The brain's memory system works like a survival filter. Every day we're flooded with information, conversations, notifications, sights, sounds, and much more. If our brain stored all of it permanently at one time, we'd be overwhelmed. So it keeps what it thinks is important and discards the rest. The problem is, our brain doesn't know that today's math lesson will be important for next week's test. The solution lies in something called the spacing effect, reviewing lessons regularly at timely intervals. A day later, a week later, a month later, and so on. Each review acts like adding a coat of varnish to wood. The information becomes more resistant to fading. I once met a student preparing for a medical college entrance exam who stopped cramming chapters in one sitting. Instead, she broke them into smaller parts, reviewed them regularly, and used flashcards on exam day. She didn't just remember definitions, she could explain concepts confidently. And that is the power of psychology applied to learning. The second challenge low motivation. If you ask my students why they study, you'll often hear answers like to get good grades, to make my parents happy, or to avoid failing. Psychologists call this extrinsic motivation. Motivation driven by external rewards or punishments. While this works for short term tasks, it often fades when the reward is removed. You might study for a test, but once that test is over, the knowledge loses value in your mind. The stronger and longer lasting force is called intrinsic motivation. Learning because you are curious, passionate, or find personal meaning in the subject. When we are intrinsically motivated, learning becomes a self-sustaining process. The brain even releases a feel good chemical called dopamine, making the process more enjoyable. Yesterday in my class, I conducted a survey and I found out that out of the 28 students present, 26 of them were extrinsically motivated, whilst only two were intrinsically motivated. So how can we boost intrinsic motivation? First of all, by varying the teaching method. I once saw this in my math class, where my teacher replaced textbook exercises with a project setting up a school carnival within a set budget. Students had to calculate costs, predict profits, and design marketing strategies. Suddenly, math wasn't just abstract numbers, it was about food stalls, ticket sales, and music bands. Engagement skyrocketed because the learning felt alive. The third challenge short attention spans. I'm sure that we can all relate to the situation where we are sitting in a class. The teacher comes in and starts explaining the lesson. At that time you think, okay, what are we going to learn today? You try to focus as much as you can for around 10 to 15 minutes, but after that, your attention shifts to the clock. You start wondering when will the lesson be over? When will the bell ring? When can I have my lunch? When can I meet my friends? And this is exactly what studies have proved that the average learner can only really focus for about 10 to 15 minutes before naturally, the mind begins to wander. In our modern world, with technology advanced and social media feeding us instant rewards, our attention spans have become even shorter. For example, I end up opening my Instagram every few minutes just to check if I got a message or notification. Eventually, I'll tell myself I'll just take a quick five minute break. But of course, that five becomes a 50. As some of you might think, this is not a sign of laziness. In fact, this is how our brains have evolved for thousands of years. Humans needed to shift their attention quickly in order to survive. A rustle in the bushes could mean danger. So we were wired to notice new things quickly. Basically, in simple words, we were used to shifting our attention more often. That same mechanism now makes a long lecture feel mentally exhausting. The solution? Break information into smaller parts and again varied a teaching method also known as the Pomodoro effect. After explaining part of a topic, shift to a short discussion, a story or a visual, even a one minute pause for effect can re-engage the brain and help maintain focus. When I was younger, I learned the solar system when my teacher made us physically become the planets, each revolving around the sun in the center. The movement, the laughter, the novelty all work together to fix the concept in our minds. Weeks later, we could explain everything in detail in our own words because we had not just learned it, but lived it. The fourth challenge. Oh, sorry. My bad. The fourth challenge. One size fits all. Teaching. In 1983, psychologist Howard Gardner introduced the theory of multiple intelligences, the idea that everyone is smart in different ways. musical bodily kinesthetic linguistic logical mathematical interpersonal, intorpersonal, and many more. However, much of today's education only focuses on linguistic and logical mathematical reading, writing, and numbers. When we fail to recognize different learning styles, we are unintentionally sidelining students whose strength lies elsewhere. Imagine asking a musically gifted student to learn history only through reading, or a physically active student to sit still for hours and listen to long lectures. We're not teaching them in the way that they learn best. The solution is to diversify Versify these different learning styles. Once when I was learning about ancient Egypt, we were given options for a project. Write an essay. Create hieroglyphic art, build up a model of a pyramid, do a short play, and many more. Each path led to the same learning outcome, but everyone engaged in the way that suits them best. Everyone was creative, enjoying and most importantly, invested. The fifth and final challenge. Learning difficulties. Conditions like dyslexia, ADHD and autism are not indicators of low intelligence. They are just different ways of processing information. However, much of today's education system is only built for the average learner, leaving others behind. Psychology, on the other hand, offers powerful solutions. Examples for dyslexia. Audiobooks. Text to speech and speech to text tools and colored overlays can help make reading less stressful for ADHD. Breaking tasks into smaller steps, incorporating movement breaks and using timers can help maintain focus for autism. Visualize schedules, predictable routines, and sensory friendly spaces can help reduce anxiety. I once had a friend with dyslexia who struggled with traditional writing assessments, but when allowed to record her voice verbally, she demonstrated deep understanding of her learning. Her challenge was never about intelligence. It was about finding the right way for her to express what she knew. So what does all of this mean? It means that education is not about just delivering information, it's about delivering it in a way the mind can absorb, retain and enjoy. It means that forgetting is natural, but space, repetition and remembering can fight it. That motivation thrives when learning is meaningful, that attention can be renewed with variety, that one size fits all teaching fits almost no one, and that learning differences are not deficits. They are different paths to brilliance. Education should not be the act of pouring facts into a bucket. It should be the act of igniting a fire, a fire full of curiosity, creativity, and lifelong learning. And that fire shines brightest when we teach and learn not just with knowledge, but an understanding of the human mind. Thank you.",1

So, um I had a big plan of what I'm going to say, but I just changed sort of a lot of things in my mind of what I want to share with you because I see a lot of you know great stories. So I think what I can share with you today it it's still designing your life but I want to share the story of my life which is not um I think people can reflect if you can you can share with your friends not a typical I mean probably typical but not shared out really in in space. So I'm very um honored and very happy. So this is the place where I first start my kindergarten. This is where I learned to speak, to count, to speak English, speaks ties, learn science, everything start at this school. And I never ever imagined gonna be standing, you know, here talking to my younger sisters, a lot younger. So, um, thank you very much. And I'm actually a life designer and I learned that when I was much older that you too one day will know that you are already a designer of a lot of thing especially of your own life. Okay. So my journey I try to break it up in three different chapters. So what I do when I was very young like in school here um I try to study hard. Um, I wasn't an A student. I have to study very hard to get an A. Still, I would get a B+. And I was kind of sad, but that's how I have to live my life. So, I always work hard because teachers and mom and dad says you have to get a good grade, and good grade means good future. So, that was the only plan I have. I don't know the I don't know what my future will be. I have no idea what I wanted to be, but I just thought, you know, whatever they say, study hard. So, I did. So I study very hard. I get a somewhat good grade, B+, sometime A, sometimes C. And um I eventually get into good university. But I got into good university because I only picked the subject, you know, that I liked. I had to find a way to get into good study. I was really bad at math. So I I mean, I'm not sure everyone want to follow, but my trick was I just completely stopped studying math. I mean, I study in school, but I don't study it off school because I know I have 24 hours. If I spend 12 hours studying math, I only get two points extra. But if I that 12 hours I did social science, I did English, I did um Thai, I get like 50%, 50 marks more. So, I thought that 12 hours I rather spent on something, you know, I could improve a lot. So that was my strategy of you know having to survive being a B+ or B student. So I did got into a good university. I wasn't good at math but I went into BBA which require a lot of math but that was because I had to pick back then was something that study in English because I was good in English. So something that teaches in English something I I can put myself into an environment where I can actually use my strength. So that was my strategy. So I did went into BBA Jula right so graduated. So that was my first part and then I was like what do I do next? But before I got into Jula one thing changed me in the middle of being in high school. When I was in this school at seventh grade my dad had to move to Korea and I was like what do I do? I don't have any friends. All my friends are here. I was so excited to get into the big building behind where all the PP like matayong was there. It was my first time in seventh no m sorry 10th grade. It was first time I got to wear you know different uniform. I was so excited and then like three months later I realized I have to move to Korea with my dad and that actually changed a lot of thing about me. I went to Korea without knowing what it's like. I speak English but wasn't fluent at all. I first went into international school. Coming from all from all girls school, it was first time seeing boys and girl kisses and I was like running home crying. I was like, ""Mom, I see people kisses. What do I do?"" And I was like I was so scared. And then and then um I start playing sports like you said. I start playing sports with my friends. I play basketball. You know, whatever my friend was playing, I was just playing with them. I don't play any sports, but I just wanted to get along and belong with someone. So, I play basketball, I play soccer, I play volleyball, I play tennis. I wasn't good at it, but I played because I wanted to get into like society and meeting people. So, within like three weeks, I started new friends, speak more English with more confidence. And I thought, hey, that wasn't so bad. being scared and you know throw myself into unknown thing. First two days I was crying. I was really scared but then I pushed myself and know I gave it more try. Give it more try and by three weeks my mom said I heard you were talking to your friends at English and I didn't realize you were tie and I was like really you know I was so happy and you know I walked around see people kissing in the hallway and I was like doesn't matter you know this is okay this is natural different culture and I learned so much from pushing myself into this unknown. So in life you will see you will get you know weird door open in your face and you kind of like that wasn't a door that I think I planned to get into and it just all just pops open and you can actually peek in there maybe step your foot in there you might learn something it will feel scary you can go and you know improve yourself grow from it if you don't like it you can step out of it it's okay but I think I wanted to give it a And I did and a lot of stories in my life the way I grow up was you know going through this unknown door that just opened here and there. So that you know that's why my next chapter I named it the explorer. So after I moved to Korea I start to realize you know exploring is fun. I get to learn and see different things. So when I went into Chula, I just go to Australia and live there for six months as an exchange students and I know what I like about Australia and not like about Australia and actually kind of make me go through life a little bit easier when I had to select something. For example, after I finished university, I had to um select where I want to go to school. Um, Australia wasn't really my first choice because it was very to me then when I was younger. It was everything the the shopping mall closed at five. So, I didn't like that. But I I the rest of it I really like, you know, I get to meet Australian friends and when I meet people now, I can say, ""Hey, I studied in Australia before."" And I use that for bonding at this point of time when I'm much older. So, I went to Australia and then I Oh, and then I went after I finished My mom always she was a flight attendant. So that was one of my I didn't know the word manifest before but I always wanted to live like a flight attendant job like my mom. So I know there was one thing I wanted to do. So after I finished BBA Jula, right? I didn't even know which airline to go to. I wanted to go to Thai Airways. Simple typical things, right? It doesn't open. It's closed for a long time. All of a sudden Japan Airlines open. I don't speak any Japanese at all. And I was like, I'll just go and apply for it, right? And then I'd go interview and it's like I don't I just tell I don't speak Japanese, but I don't know. I got in. So I did manifest, I guess, and took the action and then I tried and then I act and it happened. So I jumped into that unknown door again and they taught me Japanese and now Japanese is my third language and I speak Japanese within like two months. Good training from them, but I now do speak Japanese. Even when I'm older, I still remember. So I got that from just going to the unknown door again. Um then I was flying with Japan Airlines. I knew I had to do master and I wasn't I did BBA, right? I'm an airline. So I was thinking what do I do now? I need to go to management still. But so I went into management in hotel hospitality management and I applied for like second tier school because I like I said I'm always in my head I'm a B+ students and then my so I applied to about 12 different schools all Bgrade school right my dad's friend was like why don't you apply for Cornell and I was like there's no way I'm going to you know get into Cornell like my GMAT doesn't even hit what they asked for and I take the GMAT for three times I'm still like below what they asked and I was like, ""Well, it's only $100 more for the application. I already spent a lot."" So, I was like, ""Okay, I'll just have everything, put everything in envelope and then shipped it to Cornell Hotel School."" And I got in. The first day I went to Cornell, I go knock the admission door. I said, ""Can I ask you why did you accept me?"" And I said, ""My wasn't even there."" and they said, ""Oh, because that year um there was no Thai students there and no airline experience students and we wanted to have um diversity in class."" So that's when I really realized I don't know. You don't know what's behind those doors. There are so many things that you don't know that they're looking for. if you kind of um stop yourself, limit yourself and think you can't go that far, you won't get into you know all these great things in your life. So from then I was kind of like okay I'll just throw myself into anything. If I can survive then you know I'll be a better person at least. If I don't I'll just be the same. So nothing to lose. So that's how I did my explore life. So basically am I a designer? I think my design would be like just I mean I was I don't have this in my slides because I just think of it now. You know how the art is when you have a art when people just draw impression and kind of like don't have the idea what it is and go with the flow and it becomes pretty. I think that's kind of designer that I am with my life. I just take what it comes and then paint that into my life but make sure that you know it looks pretty and I don't get myself into ugly picture. So, but as a designer at Explorer, you will need to have a tiny compass still. I do have my little compass. I do all this random thing, but I still have not a GPS. Now, GPS kind of make you go where they want you to go, right? Compass have to look at it and realize what it is. So, I I do have my compass. My compass is actually I think of it last night is actually curiosity. I'm always curious what's behind that door from that career time. What's behind that door? Do I want to go picking? I go look. So, I jumped in always. So, KR city, I want to grow because I think I'm a B+. I always wanted to improve myself. I want to grow one day. I want to be an A. It might not happen anymore because I don't I'm not a student anymore. But, you know, still I'm I think I grow. And also, very important, I want to be happy. anything I do, I want to make sure that I'm very happy. So that is my compass and that's what I look at when I get lost. Sometimes sometime you will get lost but when you have that compass, it's actually your value. If you know what is um in your heart is important to you, use that to guide your life and design throughout the way. I never know what I wanted to do. I never know what life will take me. I just go with opportunity that comes and then be curious at it, you know, and grow along with it. Be scared but jump into it and happily, you know, stay with it. So I'm gonna jump everything because what everything takes me to today is like your friend said director of the institution of education that teach tech design and entrepreneurship nothing relate to me nothing related to my degree but if you come to the campus people starting to say why does it feel doesn't feel like school and I that I use a lot of services and hospitality that I learned into managing this campus and it feels more like hotel, restaurants, like a homey place like that. So that's what I do now. I I I oversee a university that UTCC University Thai Chamber of Commerce collabs with a university from Spain. They teach tech te tech te tech te tech te tech te tech te tech te tech te tech te tech te technology, they teach entrepreneurship and they teach design. And um it's it's a very it's very new. I had to break a lot of rules to make it happen. But luckily the higher education, the ministry of high education, they let me kind of test it out. So that's a weird door for me again to go and break rules of traditional university in Thailand and tell the ministry which rule doesn't work to make you know education better in Thailand. So that's how I operate this um university at UTCC. And I guess what I want to leave for you before I go is that for you um I give you three things from my story is you need to notice what excites you, what makes you like time pass like figure skating, time pass, but you kind of try hard to mix it with your study life. So one thing always notice yourself. What makes you happy? What excites you? What makes your time lost and you didn't realize it and say yes to opportunities when it comes just peaks your heads in it and see what it looks like. Put your foot in it. It might get dirty but it will makes you stronger and reflect and adjust. When you're older all those things, all your compass will not be the same as when you're 15 or 18. When you're 25, you're 30. Your compass where you want to go will be different. So don't stick to what you are today. Design it throughout your whole life of what going to be your happiness. So let's see. I'm going to I think everybody is a life designer and you should all have fun designing your own life.",1

On the outside, people thought she had it all figured out. Good grades, clear goals, tons of fun hobbies, and love for her friends and family. But what they didn't see was the coldness and fear that lay inside the ball. Every time she made a mistake, the glass cracked just a little. a hairline fracture no one else could see but her. But even with the fractures, she still stepped out into the world. Traveling across continents, from buzzing capitals to quiet classrooms tucked in corners of the globe, she carried herself with curiosity. Yet, the glass ball came with her everywhere she went. It wasn't just a place for her. It was a state of mind. No matter how far she traveled, perfection would always echo and new expectations would always rise. And soon the crystal glass ball turned foggy from breath held for too long and thoughts kept to maintain the illusion. Well, ladies and gentlemen, I hope it wouldn't surprise you that that girl was me. And the glass ball, that was the world I built with perfectionism. beautiful, impressive, and terrifying to live in. Perfectionism, according to Oxford Learner's Dictionary, is defined as the fact of liking to do things perfectly and not being satisfied with anything less. Perfectionism can manifest in various forms. Whether it is appearance, the desire to look perfect, social, seeking approval from others, or rethinking texts and conversations, or in my case, academic perfection, like obsessing over academic performance, perfect scores, assignments, the list goes on. Never in a million years would I have thought that I would one day become a perfectionist. You see, ever since I was little, I never have expected much from myself. I was happy and fulfilled with just the pass on a quiz. And I didn't always care about homework or projects. But somehow out of nowhere, I steered my ship into a completely different direction. I started caring more about school. Classwork, participation, exams, all was given my best attention to. It was great at first as teachers complimented my big improvements and believe me my parents were over the moon. However, that balanced consistency and determination to be on top of things slowly deteriorated into something darker. That aim of trying to do better or trying your best turned into trying to do perfect. So what does it mean to do perfect? To me, you have to be flawless. I would set out really high standards that had to be met. I would consider a score that is less than 18 out of 20 a fail. And God was I scared of failing. Every day was like walking on this tight rope and that one wrong step would kill me. And that's not it. Sometimes I would work super hard, but still wouldn't feel like it's enough. Like when I studied more than three times for a quiz which had only 10 questions. Three times. It wasn't because I wasn't comfortable with the materials being tested, but more of me being afraid of not achieving the desired outcome, which in that case was perfection. And that initiated a whole cycle of studying and reviewing as an escape from that fear. On top of that, when I make mistakes, they will flow in and out of my mind throughout the day and every now and then lead to self-criticism. By now, you're probably thinking that I'm a psycho, and I would be lying if I didn't say the same. Here, I have a video of a hamster running on a wheel non-stop. I am that hamster. The cause of this action is the self-imposed pressure the hamster is carrying. But carrying it for too long will lead to a buildup of stress, self-doubt, low self-esteem, and eventually at some point burnout. It was a dramatic. I just crashed. Experiencing burnout was kind of numbing. I was constantly tired, experiencing headaches, struggling to concentrate, and forgetting things more often than usual. It was like I was too exhausted to even try anymore, so I stopped. Has anyone here ever felt like that? Like the atoms in your body are crumbling down, and you can start to feel yourself losing control? Because if you have, then you're not alone. Believe it or not, according to the American Psychological Association, perfectionism affects an estimated 25 to 30% of children and adolescent worldwide. Meaning, one in every three young people is quietly battling the pressure to be perfect. But, you know, sometimes it takes falling apart a little to pick yourself back up. Like this broken teacup that has been glued back together. Yes, their cracks are still visible, but every single one of these cracks is a reminder of the experiences and obstacles overcome. And with time and patience, these cracks will become marks of strength, proving that the teacup will become stronger than it ever was before. Therefore, I started small and fed in healthier mindsets. This is my list of newly adopted mindsets. One, making mistakes is part of growing and improving. In fact, some of the most valuable lessons I've learned in my life have been extracted from the mistakes I've made. Two, perfect does not mean success. Success to me is staying true to yourself, failing but still trying, and working hard while still finding joy in the little things along the way. Three, replace perfect with proud. I ask myself now, am I proud of the effort? Because perfectionism doesn't mean you're broken. It means you care deeply and that is not a flaw. But caring too much about never messing up now that can steal your joy. Today I still try my best. If I don't get a 19 or 20 on an exam, I breathe, I laugh, and I move on. I no longer will aim for perfection, but aim for my best. I won't set impossible expectations, but achievable ones. Now, I've realized that even if I don't pressure myself, I can still get good grades simply by being a good student and giving it my best effort. Because life isn't a test you can ace. It's a messy, beautiful, imperfect journey. And if it's one thing that girl from the crystal glass ball has learned, it is to be real, not perfect. Thank you.",1
vc8qy9bJnNc,I can do anything! | Ms. Sonal Ambani | TEDxYouth@JGIS,"In this powerful and heartfelt TEDx talk, Ms. Sonal Ambani, internationally acclaimed sculptor and designer, takes the audience on an inspiring journey through her art and the deeper messages it holds about equality, purpose, and love.

Through her iconic sculptures — Slings and Arrows of Outrageous Fortune, Little Blue Screen, We Dream Under the Same Sky, and XOXO — Sonal blends creativity with consciousness, touching upon gender equality, technology, human connection, and the timeless importance of love and dreams.

She reminds us that art is not just something we see — it’s something we feel, live, and learn from.
Her message is simple yet profound: “I can do anything.” “Look up, and see the world around you.” “Read every single day.” “Stay in love — with yourself, people, and life. Ms. Sonal Ambani is a globally exhibited sculptor whose works in steel and bronze explore resilience, digital culture, and gender equality.

It's so wonderful to be here with you at G at JGIS and to speak to you this evening. My name is Sonel Amani and I'm here to take you through my personal journey through my art. Um the first thing I want everyone to put their hands up in the air like this. Can you all put your can you put the class up together and can you stretch three times everybody? One, two, three. And now I'm going to ask you all to say one thing. Can you say it for me? I want you when we raise our hands, we're all going to say, ""I can do anything."" Let's do it together. I can do anything. I think we can do a little little better and a little louder, please. I can do anything and that's what this journey is about. Um, I'm going to tell you about uh my sculptures and um I hope they spark curiosity, they spark connection and they spark love for you. So my first sculpture is called Slings and Arrows of Outreach's Fortune. It's from Hamlet from Shakespeare. And the sculpture, I'll tell you a little bit about the genesis behind the sculpture. Uh I was once upon a time a high school student like all of you. And I played the double bass. The double bass is a musical instrument, a large one like the satar. And the good student or child that I was from I played it all the way from third grade to 12th grade. And I practiced every single day, very passionate about music. And I was always first base in my school, uh, first position. And I was honored and I was selected to represent state. That means the best players from all around the state and it's a very big honor in New York. Um so when we go on stage and uh of course here I am thinking okay, you know this person who's practiced their whole life is so good and once we're on stage to the left of me was a boy. Now it's okay if there was a boy but there was actually there was no audition. It was just presumed that a boy would play better than a girl. And that haunted me for years now. Come full circle in 2023 at from Harvard University, Professor Claudia Golden was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics for her work on gender bias and gender inequality. And that's what the sculpture talks about. And I'll explain the sculpture to you. So the sculpture consists of three parts. One is the bull. The bull is male dominance, the male charging forward. The arrows represent women speaking up all over the world, asking for equality. And the red circle is women united the world over. And what's important about this is that um today even in in a country like America the pay scale is for every $100 a person a man makes a woman makes $87 and sometimes as low as $67. And here in India the pay scale at a certain job for every hundred rupees a man makes a woman will make 40 rup rupees. the same laborer doing the same the same work will earn so much less than the man will. So now it's up to your generation. You are the first generation and all of you looking here who can make this equal and the reason is it's wonderful all the way from education to entertainment people are speaking up and I'm very proud to say for the first time the women's Indian cricket team is paying this being paid the same as a men's cricket team also the world over in tennis the same for the winners of all the grand slam all the big prize the same winner because they both imagine you're working playing the same number of hours they earn the same skill but we have far to go because there's a lot of injustice in many other industries but your generation can make that change and the reason you need to make that change is because for girls when a girl is happy a home is happy family's happy it's equally important for you guys because you want to see your sisters happy your mom's happy and when a girl is happy in the home. What can they do? I put your hands up in the air and they can do everyone. Hands up and you can say, ""I can do anything."" Right. I'm going to tell you a little bit about my journey. Um I was an investment banker down on Wall Street, 73rd floor of the World Trade Center. and I came to India for one of those big fat Indian weddings. So when I was at the wedding, I met this handsome young man who's here in the audience today, my dear husband Miml and he swept me off my feet and brought me to India. But the good part about that is since I'm here, I'm here in front of all of you today and very happy to be so. I think one of the best decisions of my life and I think he feels the same way too. So here I was at that point in time. Um, women did not join the family business. So here I am, this New Yorker who walks very fast, who thinks very fast, who talks very fast. I I do always have to slow down. You're supposed to remind me to if I go too slow to go. So thinks fast, walk fast, talks fast. So what am I going to do? So I started with sculptures. I was always very passionate about sculptures. I loved um I was good at it as a kid and um I started doing sculptures in my garden. There's an example right there. And at one point in my garden, we had over 50 sculptures. And my kids said, ""Mom, it's like Alice in Wonderland here. We had life-sized dinosaurs, giraffes, monkeys. We even had a Spongebob."" So with those sculptures and one day someone from the India art fair that's in Delhi that happens every year came and said hey these are really good you should show these at the art fair and lo and behold a few sculptures were shown there and um I feel very blessed from there one thing happened to another and at this point now they're all around the world and the sculptures are gone but the reason I was able to do that is because I loved what I Oh, and a very important thing what even happened right now is uh literally a week ago I flew in from New York and you know New York is such a long flight such a journey norally normally when you come back from international travel you're exhausted but as I hit the ground in the first thing I did was go to my office go to my workshop I'm blessed my wonderful office team is here with me today because my work is play and my play is work and I'm very blessed that I can do that and I think for everyone here if you can find that and also don't remember even if like I was an investment banker but I changed courses you know there's in life you're get other opportunities and you should go for it and try for it so my work is play is work and I love what I do every second and the reason I had I could do it cuz I had confidence, loved what I did. And therefore, everyone, hands up in the air, we can say I can do it. Okay. The next sculpture I'm going to share with you Okay. The title of this sculpture is Little Blue Screen and this is a 6 foot diameter globe with a three-foot base. So, it's a 9 foot huge sculpture. And what I'm saying in this sculpture is how technology has taken over our lives. If you there's a little blue screen inside and you can see the reflection on the ceiling. And what I'm saying is the night sky is no longer the stars and the moon. The night sky now is Netflix. It's Amazon Prime. It's Instagram. It's Snapchat. It's all the games your kids are gone. It used to be Fortnite. I don't know what the most recent game are all playing, but um even, you know, at my brother's home, it could be one child here and literally the neighbor across the street, but instead of playing with each other, they're um they're playing online. And even the globe is made out of all the icons and of each of these apps that everyone is using today. So, what's happened with uh technology? Who would have thought that this little slab of glass that we put in our hand would become an extension? If you don't see your family or your kids for for a day or a week even, you know, sometimes you're traveling, you don't think, but if you miss your phone for even 10 seconds, panic strikes and you have to find it. So, with technology, what we need to do is remember that um we need to go outside. Now, we're missing humanity. We're we're missing connecting with people and um people offer looking at the night sky. So, can all of you promise me today that when you go home, whether it be from the street, you look out your window, go onto your pal balcony if you can to your terrace and look up at the night sky and see the stars and see the moon. And can you even do this? make a wish on a star for me because if you remember in the old days we'd even sleep on the terrace. I don't think anyone does that anymore because there' be no TV on the terrace. There's no internet maybe on your terrace. So one do that for me. Number two is be out in nature because of technology. people stop really going outside. And studies have been shown that when you're even in front of a beautiful flower, when you're in front of a tree, when you're in the woods, your mind is calmer. And when your mind is calmer, ideas come. And when ideas come, that's when creativity comes. And when your mind is calm, what can you do? Hands up. I can do anything. Get the next. Sorry about this. This sculpture is called We Dream Under the Same Sky, right? We're all here. We're all dreaming under the same sky. And the golden rings that you see, sometimes your rings, the rings are your dreams. And sometimes your rings just stay and they never move up. Sometimes your dreams, your dreams stop halfway. And sometimes like the center pillar, your greens are open and they can reach up forever. And what's really interesting about this piece is that it's an enigma, a puzzle. And each of the time pieces represent visionaries in this world who've changed our lives. Um, say for example, Mahatma Gandhi's birthday is October 2nd. So the time piece reads 10:02 or Steve Jobs birthday is Feb 28. So the time piece reads 2:28. So it's multi it's over a hundred people. It was really fun doing research anywhere from Madame Cury who invented the X-ray. Madam Pury, um, um, Nelson Mandela, March of Luther King, um, even Oprah Winfrey. And the one thing when I was doing the research that all these people had in common was reading. And reading is so important and it's something I want to emphasize to each and every one of you how important it is. And when I was reading their histories, even Madam Cury read, of course, the research was there, but she's the one who invented the X-ray and radiation. But um read books in multiple languages. Even I think most of you know Bill Gates is a voracious reader. Jeff Bezos, even Nelson Mandela was when he was in prison was reading all books, even Gandhi's books on freedom. So if you can all promise me that you can read. Uh, the reason is I know it's so hard for myself included. Um, it's very hard at night. You're very tempted. I've got a stack of books mine by bed, but I just got my iPad. It's like books books iPad and it's really hard to make yourself. But if you read it can open up your imagination and through your imagination, you know, the most interesting thing I don't everyone's very interesting, but you know Elon Musk, do you know how he learned to make a rocket? It was because he read books on how to make a rocket. That's what he did. He actually read books. And if you can read books, you can open your imagination and you can change the world. And then if you could change the world, guys, hands up in the air. And what do I say? I can do anything. As you can see, okay, this is my one of my favorite fun pieces. The X and O's stand for hugs and kisses. And the rabbits represent all the different people that come into our lives. Sometimes people come into sometimes you stretch yourself for love. Sometimes you hide from love. Sometime love comes to you. But the important part is the love. And I'm going to give you two personal stories on this. Um when my daughter was born u my f first child normally at the hospital you know they give you the child to feed um and they take her away but I was very lucky they let me for some reason my daughter was with me and slept with me all night and I could just feel her heartbeat right next to my heartbeat and for me that was the meaning of life and I knew I'd have a friend for life which I do to this day and that's One story about love. The second story about love is my son is uh when my son was 10 years old at that time he was at Eloia school here in Omnivad and they did a very nice questionnaire they asked the children many questions. Then they asked our par us as a parents to write what we think the children would say. So, one of the questions simp like what what's your son's best friend? What's his favorite food? And one of the questions was what made him sad this year? So, of course, best friend, I knew that. Favorite food. I knew that. And I was like, he's 10 years old. What What can he be sad about? He's a kid. And um I wrote nothing. And I saw they gave us his paper and it said, ""I lost my nanima. I missed my nanima and it broke my heart. Um, I lost my mom to cancer unfortunately too early. That's why I try to get involved and do as much cancer work as I can. I help cancer patients. Um, so but what it shows is how even we like of course I felt the great loss as my mother but how that generational love goes through even to your grand to your children or or her grandson and how much that the love meant her love meant to to him and um and as an aside I for anyone who was a grandparent grandparents even my grandmother would do things spend hours playing Monopoly would play cricket with him things she never did with us but I think that love grandparents have for their children. So, what I want to say to all of you is to remember to to be with the people that are with you and to love them and to for your children of course, but maybe that 90 year old grandmother who used to cook your most favorite meals and now kind of repeats the same stories again and again. But remember to also take some time out to be with them. And when you have love in your life, it it's of course love with family, but it's also love with your friends, it's love with your teachers, it's love with your neighbors. And um if you can, you're again, if we can do this, if we can be happy, we have love, we can be happy. And if we're happy, we can love our neighbors. If we love our neighbors, they can love their neighbors. And maybe your generation can be the first to have peace in this world. There's one more thing I'm going to ask of you. Two things today. Right now, I want you to go to the person next to you and give them a big hug. Can you do that for me? Can you hug the person next to you? That would be very nice. Don't be shy. Don't worry, they won't bite. Well, they might bite you a little bit, but maybe not. And if you could go to the other side and also on the other side, hug the person next to you. Okay. or even a handshake's okay too if you don't want to hug them if you're afraid they have to get so in the end it's love and if you have love you have everything and I'm going to do if you have love what can you do hands up in the air I can do anything one more time really loud I can do anything thank you so much it's been a pleasure",1

You've got nothing to worry about. Just stop overthinking. We've all heard these lines. Maybe we've said them and maybe we have believed them. But what if I tell you that mental health isn't always visible and pain doesn't always scream. Sometimes it smiles. A very warm welcome to everyone present here. Standing before you is Aisha Abduro from grade 12. So let's talk about my journey. I've always I was that student who always wanted everything to be perfect. Perfect grades, perfect life, perfect image, perfect personality. I started chasing perfection. But whenever I achieved something, I still felt empty like a hollow in my chest. Then I realized I started overthinking endlessly and I started getting good scores not for my parents, not for my teachers but for myself and if even after those achievements I felt empty. This was me and then I learned a very harsh and important truth that mental health struggles are often not visible in screams. Sometimes they hide behind a smile they are silenced. Let's talk about the hidden epidemic. Every day, millions of us wake up and put on a mask. Not for fun, not for survival, but for survival, not for performance. The the World Health Organization shows that over 280 million people around the world are suffering from depression and anxiety. But what if I tell you that depression isn't just sadness and mental health isn't just avoiding breakdowns. There's a myth. When we imagine someone is depressed, what we think is of tears, withdrawal, or a visible pain. But in reality, depression can be still, silent, and invisible. It could be getting 8 hours of sleep and waking up tired because your mind never rested. It could be scoring the best grades, excelling in class, but battling the urge to give up. It could be laughing with friends, but still feeling empty inside. This is what depression can look like. An absence of feeling, numbness, no joy, no sadness, nothing. Matt writes, ""You can be a glowing sun to the world and still feel like a black hole inside."" This is what depression looks like. And still so many people never acknowledge it. Ladies and gentlemen, let me introduce you to depression's deep silent cousin. Anxiety. Anxiety is depression's silent twin. Very not very obvious but deeply disruptive like a restless counterpart. Anxiety. In anxiety, your brain could think there's a lion in the room, but you're just walking into a classroom. This is what anxiety looked like. It could be sweaty palms in a simple conversation, rereading a message for 20 times before sending it or a racing heart with no trigger. They are physical symptoms of anxiety. Nausea, headache, chest tightness with no medical outcomes, no medical reasons. This is what anxiety looks like. But the main question is who suffers and why? it. Let's segregate it into two parts. The younger adults and teenagers and the older people. Let's begin with the younger adults and teenagers. The World Health Organization also reports that 20 that one in seven teenagers globally are diagnosed with a mental disorder because adolescence is no longer a stage of growth. It is a relentless stage of competition comparison and expectations. This is what adolescence is. The definition of adolesence has completely changed for the teenagers. It could be u academic pressure. Yes. Excelling in classrooms to meet invisible standards. The crushing demand to score the best grade not for ourselves but to show people. I have I I have experienced this clearly. Scoring the best grades but losing the peace of mind. Next comes cyber bullying or bullying. From bullying or cyber bullying, a student or a children can develop self harm. Let me I'll narrate a very short story. Amanda Toad, a 15year-old Canadian student very courageously shared her story on YouTube and took her own life after that. In that video, she explained how she was bullied across multiple schools. But this is a warning. This is a reminder that silence kills people and it's high time we acknowledge it. And then comes lack of emotional validation at home. When stop overreacting replaces real conversations, there's a deep crack in your self-worth. You begin to feel insecure and question your survival on this planet. Because we are surviving, we are not living. This is there's a very big difference between surviving. You are just living for the sake of living because your body is working and it may stop working if you have severe anxiety and depression. Left untreated anxiety can be converted into panic disorders, phobias and lifetime lifelong of restlessness. Now for older adults this could differ because it could be grief or chronic illness. Let me tell you how chronic illness and mental illness are related to each other. Everyone knows Selena Gome is here right very famous singer actor. She was suffering from depression and anxiety which later got converted into an autoimmune disease. What do we learn from this? We learned that it can form a cycle. Both mental illness and chronic illness together in a cycle will cost you for your entire life. Next come feel feeling invisible in a very fastmoving world or retirement because after you lose your title who are you? This is a very prime question that comes to our mind or it could be kids moving out. It could be loneliness or the grief that is suppressed within them from their teen years. This these are the symptoms for older adults. But but there's one thing very common between both the age groups. The emotions are real and often unspoken and unrealized. Now let's come up let's come to social media. I'm pretty sure 70% of the audience uses social media here. I'm sure. But what if I tell you social media is a paradox? It connects us, but it also controls us. How does it control us? Many studies show that social media is linked with loneliness, poor sleep, and depression because the definition of perfection changes. We measure our worth with likes and followers. Notifications dictate our moods. What we see, we compare our behind the scenes with someone's highlight reels. Perfect life, perfect body, perfect vacations. And slowly we begin to think that we are not enough. We need to achieve more. This is where anxiety and depression come in and affect you for the rest of your lives. I am I do not oppose social media. Social media is not evil. But when it is replacing real world conversations and self-acceptance, it is high time that we do not use social media or rather limit our use to social media. Very few are blessed with the talent of not getting affected what we see on social media. Now let's talk about the society and stigma that comes with it. Yes, stigma and society therapy controversial, right? The relationship between society and mental health is very deeply interconnected. I'll tell you because me because the society shapes how mental health is treated and talked about and for the best part it is not treated very well and it is st. Don't talk about it. Don't talk about mental health in public. People would think you are mentally ill. People would think you're crazy or a maniac. I'm pretty sure. And especially the culture in India. What would people say? Keeps families locked in denial. But let me tell you, people will always say this is the immutable truth. People will always have something to talk about. It is their job to talk because and their words are fleeting. But your mental health and everything and your well-being is eternal. And the moment we prioritize society's judgment over our healing, know that moment you are going to surrender your life to an illusion because you no longer respect your choices. You respect the society's choices. Now let's talk about trauma. The roots of the silence. Yes, trauma. I'm going to quickly give you an overview on the types of traumas. generational trauma, the same trauma running in the bloodline and we take it very proudly from for example in India the generational trauma of poverty, migration, abuse runs down from the same bloodline passed down from generation to generation and we take it very proudly. We survived this in our childhood. How can you not survive this? We used to study in the street light. How you have so many luxuries? How can you not study in this? But let me tell you the definition of comfort, perfection, anxiety, emotions differs from person to person. It will not be same. Next comes parental trauma. Very controversial. I'm sorry for all the parents sitting over here. Parental trauma. It comes when when there the affection is replaced by criticism. when neglect when there is neglect instead of care a very famous quote uh I don't remember the author but a very famous quote by her said that children live the life children bear the life the parents wish to live just ponder upon it for a minute and it's high time we understand that we have a generational gap not every generation is the same in India We think being strict is very powerful. It shows your power. It shows how you can control your children. But in reality, it is it is really disruptive for your children. And this is how generational trauma comes in where every where one for example, I'll give you a very basic example. Your parents scolding you and think and they tell you it's because of your well-being. I do not oppose strict parenting. But still the same thing follows is followed by you to your children. This is what generational trauma is. And then next comes societal trauma. Society as we discussed further. Societal trauma it could be discrimination. The urge to be looking perfect. You're so white. You are not fair. I'll tell you something. I have heard because I am very outspoken. I've heard that no man will marry me because I'm very outspoken. This is what society does to people. It is very inhumane. But the stronger minds, we need strong minds to control these kind of things. It could be discrimination, gender roles etc. And society says us that depression is just sadness. Anxiety is merely overthinking. And uh therapy is just a sign of weakness. Asking for therapy is wisdom. It's it's guidance. It's not a sign of weakness. It shows how powerful you are. Next comes neuroplasticity. Because science says there's hope. Where there's brain involved, there's obviously science. What is neuroplasticity? The thoughts we repeat like a muscle are the thoughts that get stronger. So if you're going to tell yourself I'm worthless, the brain is going to listen. And that is the same thing is embedded in your minds. On the other hand, if you tell that if you whisper, I'm okay, I'm confident, it's okay, I can do it, then your mind is going to be stronger. Dr. Christian Nef a an expert in self-compassion says self-compassion gives us the strength to thrive. We have everything in our power yet we are not making a move. And then moving ahead there's a new challenge emerged in today's digital world. Careless overusage of mental health language. Oh my god that movie gave me trauma. That unorganized stack is giving is triggering my OCD. I'm so depressed. My friend is not talking to me. What is wrong with today's generation? Overusage of such words diminishes the gravity of those who are genuinely suffering. It may it silences them further. It silences them. They feel unseen, invalidated because of these overusage of these terms. Let me tell you before a diagnosis you will not know if you have an OCD, if you have depression or if you have anxiety. So let's because usage of these terms mental health struggles should not be reduced to memes and hashtags. Come on, what world are we living in? Because they those people who are suffering deserve empathy, not entertainment. And as of today's generation, we have so many tools. So let's use them. Let's talk about mental health with passion, precision, and respect because words can either heal or harm. Now let's talk about how do we reduce the anxiety and depression? How do we destigmatize these? Well, let me tell you. Let's begin with therapy. Okay, this chart shows that over 60% of people never receive therapy due to either stigma or lack of access or rather based on decision. That is 60% of diagnosed people I'm talking about. Now see where the world is going. Talking about therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, it helps to reframe all the destructive thoughts that are running around your brain. It helps to it it is equipped. It is equipped. Okay. It will equip us and we'll identify the cycle of negative thoughts. We'll dismantle it. This is how this is how CBT works. Art therapy. You know your life is not only black and white. It needs color. Art therapy adds colors to your emotions to your life and you begin to feel yourself again. Next comes the impact of therapy. Therapy is not something as we say this is because she has money she's taking therapy. Oh because she wants time pass she's taking therapy this is nothing as therapy you will be okay it'll be fine. No this this chart shows 75% people were happier and satisfied after taking therapy. These are proofs evidences that therapy works for people. Imagine 75% of the world population being happy. Now, next comes mindfulness and journaling. Mindfulness and journaling. Writing down your thoughts on a piece of paper will help you to take away the power away from the chaos. Meditating for at least 10 minutes will give you tranquil tranquility for the rest of the day. Sleep, nutrition, we have a glorified exhaustion. Fatigue is an achievement. I slept for 3 hours and I'm so active for the day. Right? We brag about it. Our generation is completely lost because we glorify exhaustion. We think fatigue is a very big achievement. Guinness World Guinness World Record. This is what we feel. Next, I'll tell you sleep and real food are what is required. The these are not indulgences. These are the non-negotiable foundations. Now, exercise. Exercise releases endorphins, natural mood busters. It elevates your mood and reduces stress. Now, in conclusion, here's my call to the humanity. Vulnerability is not frailty. It is fortitude. You need strength. True strength is saying, ""I am okay and I'm allowing myself to be seen."" And let me tell you, our society idolizes strength, but we misunderstand vulnerability. Yet vulnerability is the birthplace of true courage. Let's build a foundation because mental health is not luxury. And if we accept that, if we accept that we are not okay, this will not diminish this truth will not diminish us. It will define our humanity. And once we start living in a society where mental health and therapy is considered normal not rare, we begin to heal and we can tell that we have reached a full level of humanity. Now let's break our silence. Let's not step behind doors. Rather step in and say I'm not okay. Let's together break the silence. Let's together heal. Thank you.",1

This is Arman Beg of Ninth Alpha from Solita Global Schools. I will start my talk with a simple quote. Good ideas are not born in a vacuum. They are born when humans ask them. What if your coworker was a robot? What if your personal assistant knew what you wanted before you said a single word? What if machines could not only think but create create, decide, and maybe even feel? Welcome to the era of artificial intelligence where yesterday's science fiction is today's reality. We are living in a turning point of human history where AI and robotics are not just tools anymore. They are our assistants, partners, competitors, and even sometimes challengers. They're reshaping how we live, learn, work, heal, and connect. And the question is not, can we build intelligent machines? We already have them. The real question is, what kind of world are we building with them? So, I will explain you the evolution and the power of AI. AI or artificial intelligence at its core is about creating machines that can mimic human intelligence like learning, reasoning and problem solving. It started as a simple idea in 1950s. Alan Turan asked can machines think now decades later AI is not just thinking but it's creating. like I will explain you the evolution in three main examples. First, in 1997, IBM's Deep Blue defeated world's chess champion Gary Kasparov. In 2016, Google's Alph Go defeated Lee Sidol in the complex game of Go. Today's generative AIS like Chad GPD is writing uh poetry, coding software and even performing and even passing medical exams. AI learns from massive amounts of data, text, images, sound and even videos. Unlike a human who get tires, AI gets more precise and more efficient. Now let's move on like what is robotics? Robotics is like giving bodies to the intelligent minds. Robotics is about creating machines that can perform tasks in the physical world like cleaning, manufacturing, flying and even performing surgeries. Now combine it with AI, magic happens. A robot without an AI is just an automated tool. An AI without a robot is just a brain in a jar. Together they create autonomous intelligent machines like Boston dynamic Atlas is a robot that can jump, run, and even do a backflip. Surgical robots like Davinci assist in complex operations with precision and zero faith. delivery drones use like use AI to navigate in the cities to avoid obstacles and optimize the paths. Uh let's move on the third the part like how AI and robotics is transforming our world. Let's begin right what's happening right now. AI and robotics is being used in four main segments. Health care, education, industry and labor and in your everyday life. Healthcare AI systems are diagnosing diseases faster than human doctors. Once uh IBM's Watson detected a rare form of lucuma that many human doctors missed in education like AI powered tutors like squirrel AI in China analyzes students studying pattern and adapt in real time. In Japan and South Korea, robots are used to like teach children learn uh like to teach children languages. blending learning with play. In industry, robots have been working from decades, but now collaborative robots or cobots have been like working with humans side by side, not replacing them, but augmenting them. So, humans can handle decisions, empathy, and creativity. And robots are like handles the dangerous ones. Now let's move on the fourth part the most controversial and like the diverse section of AI ethical issues of ethical demise and human responsibility. AI and robotics raise ethical challenges that we cannot ignore like job displacement. Will robots replace workers? Yes, some of them. but also create new ones like AI trainers, robot technicians, and ethics supervisors. A study by Oxford University claims that 47% of jobs would be replaced by the robots. Second, bias in AI. If AI learns from the data, if the data is biased, then AI will be too. We have seen this in hiring algorithms that support men over women and law enforcement tools. We must build transparent and fair systems. Then comes dependency versus humanity. If AI like is if AI is thinking for us, do we stop thinking? No. AI must amplify human intelligence, not replace it. If we feed it only one version of humanity, it will affect only one kind of world. Lord, let's move like the promise. Why it matters? Why are we talking about this? Because AI has the power to solve world's some of the world's biggest problems like climate change. AI models simulate weather, predict disasters and even like optimize energy use, healthcare for all. AI and robotics can reach remote areas with minimal human resources and food security. AIdriven agriculture can maximize yield and reduce waste. Disability support. uh AI hearing uh AI hearing aids, robotic limbs, brain interface machines and transforming accessibility. But here is the catch. Technology doesn't solve problem on its own. People do it. Now let's move on like the future we can create. Let's imagine a better future where AI like a Kenyan girl uh learning quantum physics by an AI tutor where a blind man in New York navigating cities using AI glasses uh and where AI doesn't replace teachers but gives them superpowers so no child is never left behind. Where AI reflects our values, not just our intelligence, but our humanity. Now, so where does that leave us? AI and robotics are not just inventions. They're reflections of us, our flaws, our ambitions, our intelligence. They're asking us what kind of species do you want to be? The one who lets machines dictate the future or one who guides them with wisdom, purpose, and heart. We stand at a fork in their road because the future is not being written by the algorithms. It's going to be written by people who made them. Let that be you. Let that be us. Thank you.",1

I want to begin my talk with a simple question. Have you ever felt invisible? Not ignored, not overlooked, but truly invisible to the system where however hard you try, the world seems rigged against you. Imagine living like that every day. Today I'm not here to just talk about poverty and inequality as statics, charts or headlines. I'm here to talk about people, about choices, about system, and most of all about hope and what it really takes to build a more equal world for all of us. Let me tell you a story. In a in a small rural village in Malawi, there's a 12-year-old girl named Amina. Every day her day begins before the sun rises. She grabs all the containers and just starts walking. Not to go to the school, not to study, but to bring water for her family. It's not the work that is difficult. It's the weight of the reality she is living in. Yet she dreams of becoming a doctor. But the roads to education seems like an impossible path for her because by the time she returns it's already too late and she's really tired and exhausted. She never been went to a school. And Amina is not alone. the millions of children like Amina who are carrying the weight of the system that don't support them yet continue walking continue hoping what we forget is behind every statistic behind every figure there's a living breathing person a person who shouldn't have walked miles just for the things that are basic human rights do you know in fact 10% of The world's population lives under $2 a day. It's the global standard for extreme poverty. Now imagine how would it be living on money less than a price of a coffee each day. But sadly, this is the reality of millions. When we talk about poverty, it's easy to hide behind numbers. But behind every number there's a face. A face of a child like Amina. A face of a mother who skips her meal. A face of a worker who cannot even have a day of sick leave. Because if they don't work, they don't eat for the day. Poverty is not just the lack of money. It's lack of access, lack of opportunity, lack of the support system that actually works. You see, inequality doesn't grows overnight. It's built, it's built into a system that governs the whole wide world. Think about it. The school we go to is often determined by our neighborhood. The job we proceeded by our parents' income and the network they can provide. While some children can afford to fall, other never get a chance to rise. If you were born in a system that doesn't care about you, that doesn't value you, how would you feel? How hard would you try to get out of it? Well, inequality is not just problem in one of one part of the world. Inequality literally shows up everywhere, often in different forms. Like in rural Kenya, many student walk miles just to go to the school. But sadly they never make it due to unsafe roads, lack of infrastructure or the school fee they cannot afford. You in United States of America which is such a developed nation. Children from marginalized community face an education system that fails to provide all the resources they need to succeed. Here in India, while some children have access to worldclass education, others are forced to work. Denied the opportunity to break the cycle of poverty. It's not just the problem with those children. It's the problem for all of us because we all are responsible for the future, right? It's not about children's only. In many parts of Latin America, women's face a systematic barrier that prevents them from achieving financial independence and social equality. Everywhere you go, inequality is a silent killer, snatching opportunities before they even have a chance to be recognized. But here's a good news. Change is possible. It's happening now. Look what's happening in Colombia. cash transfers. The government directly provide financial supports to the family in need. This have reduced poverty significantly. It's not a magic fix, but it's a start. In Rwanda, the health care system is expanding through a community-based system and people are having access to health care than ever before. Here in India, the rise of micro finance is empowering women's to start their own businesses, change the lives of their families and contribute to the economy. Now you might ask why should I care? Because inequality is not just a moral issue. It's an economic issue too. Studies have shown this. When inequality is reduced, the economy grows faster. When everyone has access to proper education, health care and opportunity, society as a whole flourishes uh but what could we do? Educate ourselves. Look beyond headlines. Get involved and support organizations that are truly making difference. Use your voice. Talk about these issues. Challenge the system. Don't accept inequality. Everywhere we look, people are making different, changing the system from inside. Creating new pathways to new opportunity. Remember Amina? Imagine if she had access to clean water and a school that encouraged her potential. Imagine if she had access to a health care system that ensured her well-being. Imagine if she had all the resources to become the doctor of her dream. Her story would be totally different and far better than this. In every corner of the world, there is Anna who is waiting for a chance to thrive. And I believe we all have the power to change the system that holds people like Amina back. Together, we can build a world where no one is invisible. A world where inequality is not accepted. A world where hope is not called a luxury. And we all deserve to live in a world where every amina has a chance to thrive. And no one has to walk miles just to fetch water. And I believe if each one of us does our part well, we can build this world very soon. Thank you.",1
K3ejA0b54PU,The Science of Burnout — And How Your Brain Rebuilds You! | Agastya Sharma | TEDxYouth@JGIS,"What really happens to your brain when you’re burnt out?
In this insightful TEDx talk, Agastya Bhuvnesh Sharma dives deep into the neuroscience of burnout — explaining how chronic stress rewires our brain, silences motivation, and weakens emotional control.

But there’s hope.
Through fascinating research and relatable insights, Agastya reveals how the same brain that breaks down under pressure is also wired to rebuild itself — through rest, reflection, and resilience.

From the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex to the dopamine system, this talk explores how understanding our mind’s biology can help us move from breakdown to breakthrough. Agastya Sharma, a 16-year-old IBDP student at JG International School, is passionate about science, education, and social impact. With a strong academic focus on Biology, Chemistry, and Physics, he aspires to become a neurosurgeon, inspired by his curiosity about the human brain and its healing potential. Agastya has led community outreach initiatives with organizations such as Hamari Pahchan and India Recycles, championing education and social equity. A seasoned public speaker and MUN awardee, he is fluent in five languages and is currently authoring a research paper on BDNF-mediated neurogenesis. Balancing academics with badminton and guitar, Agastya envisions opening a hospital that provides affordable healthcare for underserved communities.

At first, you think you'll adapt. You breathe the stale air. You keep working. You keep going. You tell yourself it's fine. But after a while, something strange happens. You stop noticing. Time pass. You forget how it felt to feel motivated. You don't crash. You just fade. And that's what burnout is. After my IGCSC exams, I thought the hardest part was over. But I didn't realize how deeply burned out I was mentally, emotionally physically. Then almost immediately I moved countries from Ghana to India, from familiar faces and rhythms to a place where everything felt loud, fast, and extremely unfamiliar. I was 16 and suddenly everything I knew was different. Something was off. Every task that I tried to do started to feel heavy. I would stare at my books for hours without absorbing any information. I wasn't tired. I just wasn't feeling anything. And that's when I realized I wasn't just tired or sad. I was burned out. And scariest part, I didn't even remember what being normal used to feel like. This is what stress does to your brain. And what's this isn't just a feeling. The part of your brain that helps you learn and remember the hippocampus. It's actually shrinks. The part that helps you make decisions and focus, the preffrontal cortex. It short circuits under pressure. And the one system that makes life feel rewarding and meaningful is dopamine system. It just goes quiet. Now let's go deep into the brain and trace exactly what's happening. The hippocampus is the brain's main memory hub involved in storing, forming, and retrieving declarative memories. But under chronic stress, especially prolonged exposure to cortisol, the body's stress hormone, this region shrinks. A study was conducted by UPNR which showed that high cortisol levels in older adults correlated with 40% smaller hypocample volume and poorer memory performance. Let's understand what this means by looking at the graph behind me. May look small. It tells a very big story. What you're looking at here is a relationship between cortisol, the body's main stress hormone, and the hippoc campus. Each dot here represents a real person. So scientists measured how their cortisol levels changed and compared it to the actual volume of the hippopus. And the trend is crystal clear. The higher the cortisol of the time, the smaller the memory center becomes. And this is why during chronic stress or burnout, you can forget passwords, birthdays, or even conversations you had the day before. You're not forgetful. Your brain is quite literally losing its grip on memory information. Now I've talked about stress but let's talk about two key areas which are deeply involved when you experience stress. The preffrontal cortex and the abdomen. The prefrontal cortex located just behind your forehead handles the high level thinking. I mean things like decision making, focus and self-control. So it's what helps you prioritize your to-do list, stay calm under pressure and just regulate your emotions. The amigdala on the other hand is located deeper in the brain and helps you process emotions especially the fight or flight response. So in well balanced brain the prefrontal cortex and the amydala balance each other out. But under chronic stress this balance shifts. The prefrontal cortex now loses efficiency and the amygdala becomes more reactive, more easily triggered. And under prolonged pressure, people often describe themselves as indecisive, forgetful, or as we all know, just not thinking straight. Now, let's look at the two pictures of the brain right here. Now the picture on the left is your brain during normal conditions. You'll see a lot of blue and green regions. This your prefrontal cortex which has multiple sub regions. But the important thing here is this part of the brain is in charge. But look at the image on the right. This is your brain during stress, chronic stress, burnout. Do you notice what's changed? Your preffrontal cortex has basically gone offline and the amydala has taken over. So your brain struggles to stay organized and focused. This is why things feel wrong even when nothing's technically wrong. Now I've talked about what happens to the brain during stress but what happens to you the person you laugh but it doesn't feel like yours. You talk but your words feel automatic. You look in the mirror and think who is this tired version of me? I used to be different. And that ladies and gentlemen is not poetic exaggeration. This is neurological reality. Chronic stress interferes with the part of our brain that helps you reflect, remember our past, and understand ourselves. But when that's disrupted, people begin to experience a fractured sense of identity. Yes, you heard me right. a fractured sense of identity. So, I want you all to do something very simple. In your head, close your eyes if you're comfortable. I want you to think of a moment where you felt most yourself, alive clear confident curious that version of yourself. Now, I want you to think of a version of yourself, maybe even a recent one, where you felt most unlike yourself. Foggy, tired, numb, maybe even irritable in a way you didn't like. Now, ask yourself, what changed? And sometimes the only thing that changed was stress, was fatigue. So we've talked about memory, planning, identity, but we need to go deeper. Not what you can't do during burnout, but what you can't feel. Joy, creativity, excitement, and dopamine. Every time you finish a task, eat a snack, or get a compliment, your brain releases a little burst of dopamine. But here's the problem. When that system is overstimulated, it crashes. Think of dopamine like a light switch. You flick it a few times, it works. But if you keep flicking it a thousand times a day, scroll, scroll, like, snack, notification, another task, the bulb burns out. Not permanently, but it dims. And that's what dopamine fatigue is. So, it's not a lack of discipline, it's literal neurochemical fatigue. Your brain is trying to conserve energy when used in the system. Now it's understood the brain is vulnerable but it is also adaptable and that ability to adapt neuroplasticity is what this next chapter is about. Now neuroplasticity is the brain's ability to change in neural function and structure in response to changes in behavior, environment and even thought. Correct? So what happens is when even in the wake of burnout your brain can choose to rebuild itself and it's not like cinematic thing that you have to do. So, allow me to share things that help me reclaim parts of my brain I thought I had lost and the science that backs them up. So, the first and foremost one, the one that I'm sure everybody at some point in their life have overlooked, sleep. sleep especially slow wave sleep helps in emotion regulation and cortical control. So disrupting our sleep cycle essentially elevates cortisol and impairs our memory center. Now once more you see the pictures of the two brains behind him. The one on the left the person has had good sleep. That means the emotional part of the brain is connected to the thinking part. That means you can respond wisely and think more clearly. But look at the other brain. This person was sleepd deprived. So that connection is broken. What this means is you feel more reactive, more easily triggered by things that normally wouldn't have really affected you. Moving on to my second one. Engaging in nonoutcomebased creativity such as doodling, music or even just open-ended play in general. And this helps a part of our brain to process and integrate emotions better. So it replenishes dopamine by creating low pressure novel stimulations. Right. So this is a quote that I really I do try to aspire to live up to every day. It may not be every day but I try and is what matters. Art is the highest form of hope. Moving to my third one. Something that I know a lot of people find corny and cheesy. something that my fellow speaker had also mentioned journaling. Journaling helps improve the left preffrontal cortex. So it means it helps you in self coherence understanding yourself. A study was conducted by UCLA which showed that participants who journaled about distress showed improvement in cognitive control. So labeling emotions help reduce the activity of the very reactive part of the evict of the brain. So journey as I mentioned now moving to something new once again seeking novelty. What does that mean? trying new or unexpected thing. As I said, boosts our brain's motivation system. So for me, I started googling weird things again. What does space smell like? Why do cats purr? It wasn't for school. It wasn't for performance. It reminded my brain that I'm allowed to want to know things just because. And moving to my fifth and final one, habits. Habits create what's called predictable dopamine cues. So essentially they reduce the fatigue that goes into making decisions and in turn this creates positive loops, expectation loops that makes your brain feel it is at rest. Mine was tying my shoelaces slowly. Sounds silly, I know. But in that moment, I wasn't rushing. I was arriving. So, remember how we talked about that room with no windows, no sunlight, no fresh air, just a ticking clock that you couldn't hear anymore. That room wasn't a metaphor for despair. It was a mirror of what happens when your brain under stress starts to shut out the world and eventually starts to shut out yourself. Because the title of my talk wasn't just a metaphor. This is how the brain breaks down and builds you in you. Not in grand cinematic moments, in small quiet acts of care, in sleeping in time, in replacing pressure with presence. The day you start showing up for your brain, your brain begins to show up for yourself. Thank you for listening. Thank you for staying. And ladies, just welcome back to the",1
