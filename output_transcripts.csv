0CgqT6UsR6M,so hi everyone I came here to Bangalore for Google Io connect and um it's been great so far and I'm enjoying my day and uh I have subam and Shen here so first of all thanks so much for your time and the time that you spared from your busy sh could you please quickly for our audience introduce you guys so hi everyone I'm Ken Goldberg and I'm VPN GM of cloud runtimes which means that I'm responsible for everything kubernetes and siles within Google cloud and I am subam natarajan I lead the customer engineering for Google cloud in India I take care of uh our customer issues as well as providing the right value for uh Google Cloud for customers nice so uh I'll ask a few questions to both of you and uh it will be around AI at audience will definitely be interested in KN especially your take on those question so my first question would be how will AI change the way developers work in the next 10 years I think the first thing that is going to change that Paradigm that every developer will become an AI developer so if you want to create value if you want to try some new things you'll have to be familiar with those T tools and which actually going to make you know the job of a developer a bit harder however I think that we are also going to see with AI some new tools you know we're talking about a Gemini code for example that you know it can help me complete my code lines help me do changes in in place do code reviews so hopefully that will balance H between the two nice nice amazing my second question would be around Cloud how can a beginner learn Cloud uh in general like can you give a beginner's perspective somebody who doesn't know anything apart from coding how can that person go into cloud and learn I think the magic about cloud is that we take care of the infrastructure and you know if I'm a developer all I want to do is write code in my ID so I would suggest you know if you're completely new start with Firebase maybe new ID with our serverless Solutions you click on a button and it's deployed and scaled and we do all the hard work amazing yeah nice my next question uh would be around uh what x Ai and I would say uh a misconception that a lot of people have the uh developers will lose job with the Advent of tools like Vortex because everyone can now Cod and build scalable apps and even building complex machine learning apps is an easy task for everyone what is your take on the statement that developers are going to see a decline in the number of jobs or their jobs will be hampered what is your take on that it's actually going to really help them um really push themselves to higher value functions uh platforms like vertex AI provides them the capability to do a lot of this mundane tasks in a much more efficient and consistent way uh there is a workbench that vertex AI provides which allows you to uh progressively take a particular task from beginning all the way to the end let's say you take a model how do you take that model find C and build it into an application build it into an API end point all of that is going to be possible yeah I think that was an amazing thing that was nice U from my fourth question is around Gemma 2 we all know that Gemma 2 actually outperformed a lot of open source mods and it's been amazing I mean people are building tons of Open Source apping Gemma my question is what made Jemma 2 outperforms its open source other counterparts is it the data that Google has or is it the technique that Google used or something else what made JMA to do so well oh it's a combination of everything as with every evolution in models we continue to look for uh you know fine-tuning the architecture or even selecting a different architecture as the evolution happens the number of parameters we use the architectures we choose allows ourselves to really learn from our existing um um models and the and the feedback that we are getting and then build on it really become better and better so Gemma 2 outperforming the the rest of the ones in the uh in the market is not surprising it's a it's the way you know how the models evolve correct correct awesome thank you so much shenon sub for your time I hope that you are enjoying your day here in B we are amazing yeah yeah thanks a lot enjoy the rest of your day thank you much thank you
-DWYKXE0qy0,oxps has recently launched oxy copilot which is an AI feature to reduce manual coding while scraping the web whenever we scrape a website most our time is spent understanding the structure of that website we have to work hard to find the target element so that we can get the text that we need and then we have to work on consistency of the same selector in different pages most of our time while web scrapping is spent on this the rest of the things are relatively very easy in this video I'll show you how to leverage AI to scrape any website using oxyco we'll see step by step how all these things are done let's move on to our computer screen and let's get started so guys the first thing that I want to do here is sign up on oxy laabs and then we are going to explore the oxy laap co-pilot so as you can see I'm inside my computer screen and I'm going to write oxy laabs in the search bar so let's click on this oxylabs search result and let's sign up on the oxyb website if you haven't signed up you need to sign up first but I have already signed up so I'm going to log to my account so I'm going to log in here and I'm going to all the cookies and then I'm going to start with Google Now this is actually huge because as a person who scrapes the web I understand how difficult of a task it is to scrape different websites which keeps on changing now if AI can get the job done that too accurately I don't think anything can be better than that so now I'll come here to web scripper API and I'm going to start the free trial let me read the terms and conditions and let's now click on start free trial now as you can see the free trial is activated which means we are ready to start scraping the web now it is asking me to create an API user so let me create an API user very quickly now we need this API user so that we can authenticate whenever we are using oxy laabs copilot so let me write Harry here and let me choose a strong password it is saying at least one uppercase character at least one lowercase characters okay so we need at least 12 character and also we can have underscore and I'm going to copy this and let's create our API user so my username is Harry and the password is the one that I've copied to my clipboard now it is asking me to test this setup by copy based this command in the terminal I'm going to fire git patch on my machine and then we are going to test this so let's go so let's copy this and let's paste this on G bash and as you can see the scraping has been started basically we have just tested this web scraping setup you can see this eo. third generation 16 million color something we are seeing all the products which means Amazon is getting script correctly awesome that's a good news now this is not how I want to use it I want to actually run it as a program and I want to be able to scale the setup so that I can scrape the web at scale so how do you use this in a program I'm going to show you in a bit but before that let's go to this scraper api's playground so that we can play around with this API now scraper API playground is loading now it even has code for python PHP C goang Java nodejs Json you can build the scraper and then you can copy paste the code from here which makes it very easy to use now I'm going to select Amazon here and let me open Amazon in Incognito tab so that it it is not biased and we start from a clean slate because I'm already logged into my Amazon account now let's understand the use case whenever there is a sale like flip cart's big billion day sale or Amazon's great Indian festival sale we want to actually find the laptops that we can buy and for that we go to the web we search for the laptops we short list but how about we have the data in the CSV if we can somehow get this data in CSV I think it's going to make the task a whole lot easier because we can simply look at that CSV and after looking at that CSV we can make a decision of buying a particular laptop so let's go to Amazon I'm going to select search in the scraper section and now it is asking me for a query so I'll enter search query which is laptops now there are some additional parameters like parsing do you want to parse the data do you want a parsel if you don't want the parsel you can get rid of this now I'm going to select in here because I'm in India and then location should be your PIN code and now if you leave your local as triple dot it means that you want your local to be detected autom automatically now this is the user agent which means how do you want your request to go do you want to make it as a desktop Chrome or phone Chrome or Firefox it's up to you you can actually control who your client is now there is an option of JavaScript rendering I'm going to enable it and let me explain what JavaScript rendering is whenever you go to a website it first loads the HTML and after that the JavaScript executes on that page which might change that page and might not change the page now if you enable JavaScript rendering your page will change because of that JavaScript and if you want to consider that change while scraping the web you can enable JavaScript rendering and if not you can disable the JavaScript rendering now there is no rule of thumb but you can try both of these methods when you are scraping a random website and whichever works you can adopt it now we can also give start page we can give the number of pages so it will take care of all the pages it will select all the pages and give me the data from all of these Pages basically you're scraping pages in bulk now there is something called category ID in Amazon which you can use this ID is the category ID the ID that you are seeing in the URL bar now you can copy this ID and you can paste this ID into your oxyb scraper and that is going to consider only the products from this category ID now you can also have merchant ID and you can get results only from a particular seller now these are some of the additional parameters that you can use with this scraper which makes this scraper really very custom now let's click on submit request I'm really very excited and let's see if this is able to scrape the results for me now it is asking me to change the pages to a positive integer my bad let me change this to a positive integer one and two now this is going to take some time and that doesn't matter let me tell you why that doesn't matter whenever we are scraping a website we usually do it as a Cron job on a server now we're using cron jobs on a server we don't care how much time it takes because most of the time it is a nightly job now if you do parsing false you're going to get the HTML now I'll enable this parsing as true so that I get only the passed content but in that case you are going to see the HTML now you might be thinking why would we we need the entire HTML and we would need the entire HTML because at times we want to save the HTML page so that we can scrape more parameters from the page later so let us say you are extracting prize title and reviews and later you thought I also want to extract how many were bought last month you can always do that because you have the raw HTML now the most impressive thing here is that it has given me all the results it has given me the URL it has given me the Asin Asin is basically the unique code for a given product on Amazon it has given me sales volume it is given me currency is prime or not which means that I can analyze this data even if I'm an Amazon Seller as a seller I can analyze this data and I can draw insights on which products to keep in inventory which products to sell because this is giving me sale estimate also now this was just one website oxy apps give you a lot of different options to scrape other website like Bing Google and other e-commerce websites now you can extract any other website using AI as well you just give the prompt and oxy copilot do the rest of the things now let me show you this app parsing instructions feature you can build your own parer using AI now there are four methods to build a paror either you can create using AI or you can use your template import your code or you can start from scratch now I'm going to create with AI because this is going to be the simplest way to create the passer so let's click on create using Ai and I'm going to go to the Amazon search page I'm going to write laptops let me enter the search page URL here now I want to give a prompt so I'll say I want to extract name price and star readings so I need a very simple parser and I'm going to enable JavaScript rendering because I want JavaScript to be executed whenever my page loads let's click on generate instructions and this is going to take some time it is basically generating the parser now as you can see it has generated the parsing instructions for me it basically generates a parsing schema which is capable of extracting this data out you can see we have name price tar readings amazing now these are the passing instructions which contains the data to get that pass data these instructions are basically X paath and Rex which oyap will use to get the pass data so let's save the instructions and now let's click on submit request and you can see that I have all the results in the same format as I've specified in the custom parser which is amazing we needed only the name star readings and price and we got those some of the fields are automatically added by oxyb scop Pilot like created at updated at which is fine and it also adds The Source URL which makes a lot of sense now let's explore this oxy copilot which is build your scraper with AI nice let's try this out so I'll put the URL to scrape and I'll also put the requirements let me go flip cart's website and let me grab a product from there let me search for iPhone 15 Pro Max let's copy the URL and let's take this URL and past it here and I'll say I want to scrape price title ratings and reviews and let's click on generate scraper now it is asking me to add the parsing instructions I'll continue without passing We'll add this later so I'll delete the previous parser and I'm going to build my own parser so let me click on create with AI I'll replace the Amazon URL with Flipkart URL and I'm going to change this prompt and I'll say I want to extract try title prize and star ratings let's click on generate instructions the JavaScript rendering is true and it is generating so let's wait for it to generate and as you can see it has successfully fetched the pricee title ratings amazing so let's save the instructions and let's submit the request and usually it was not giving me the correct results and after some time I realized that disabling the JavaScript rendering did the task for me so I disabled the JavaScript rendering and now I'm getting the output it is giving me all the information from the page so I hope that you were able to understand understand how to scrape the web using Ai and I hope that you like this oxyco pilot AI I'll put all the relevant information in the description of this video and in the pin comments so go ahead sign up to oxylabs try this out and start free trial it's absolutely free and definitely you're going to love it if you are somebody who scrap the web very often this is going to be very useful for you try to play around with python code JavaScript code if you are a go developer you can play around with go code as well thank you so much guys for watching this video and I will see you next time
zbz_q7uUPss,"in this video I'm going to show you how you can create a stunning travel website using WordPress this video is going to demonstrate the power of Wordpress when it comes to building a travel website we'll see how we can plan trips I'm going to show you how exactly you can create a WordPress travel website within a few clicks that's correct the website will be developed within a few clicks and then we are going to customize it by going to the WordPress dashboard it's going to be fun I'm really excited let's move on to our computer screen and let's get started all right so for this tutorial I'm going to be using local which is a tool for spawning WordPress websites locally if you don't know what is local it's actually called local WP you can install it for free and you can start by opening it and clicking on plus icon then you can create a new website and then I'm going to name it travel uh let's call it Harry travels Harry travels let's click continue preferred continue and I'm going to use a very weak password which is admin and admin just because this is by computer if you are using a serious hosting a website which is very serious and it's close to your heart and close to your business you should not use this uh username and password combination because it's very insecure uh anyways let's wait for it to finish it's basically spawning a WordPress website for me and in the meantime I'm going to show you the plugin that I'm going to use and the plugin is called WP travel engine yes this is the travel engine plug-in that we are going to use so so there are two versions of this plugin the first one is free for everyone to use and the second one is a paid plugin that we are going to talk about so let's start by creating a website using the free version of the plug-in but before that I want to make sure that my WordPress website is up and running uh local is still installing WordPress and it's done so let's click on WP admin the username is admin the password is admin yes I want it to remember me let's click on login and let's save this password and as you can see see that there is no plug-in installed uh as of now so let me click on add new plugin and I'm going to search for WP travel and it is going to show me the wp travel engine plug-in and I'm going to install it then I'm going to activate it and then I'm going to refresh this page so three steps let's do all the three steps one by one installing the plug-in the plug-in is installed let's activate the plugin the plugin is activated and now let's refresh the page and it's showing me a popup Let's uh work on this popup welcome to WP travel engine get started I want to make sure that the base currency is US Dollars the currency symbol is dollar I like dollar I don't like this USD but in case you like USD you can go ahead and choose USD then what it should be a thousand separator let's use comma and I'm going to click continue and no I don't want to disable admin notification my sales email uh notification is going to be be har at COD withh har.com you can use any email this is going to be uh the email where you are going to receive the notifications okay and your from email should also be the same in the idle scenario but let's click continue here the checkout page should be called checkout terms and conditions terms and condition thank you page should be this I want to make sure that all of these are default let's click on continue you can either use the PayPal payment Gateway or you can simply use this book now pay later I'm going to use this book now pay later so that people can book now and they can pay whenever they want uh I mean during the uh trip they can they can book before the trip or during the trip somehow so it's just like cash on delivery in e-commerce if that makes sense let's click continue and it's asking me to create my first trip so this is a travel booking website so I should create a trip in order to make sure that customers are able to purchase the trip so let's click on uh click here now it's introducing me to the WordPress block editor let's click next next next get started and this is going to be my trip code let me add the title of the trip let's call it rishikes trip and I'm going to or maybe let's call it San Francisco trip San Francisco trip so let us say I'm selling trips to San Francisco and I'm going to show you around the Google office the Microsoft Office H Etc okay let's let's write something about San Francisco trip I am going to show you around downtown San Francisco and we are going to go to the Silicon Valley Silicon Valley to the Google Facebook LinkedIn Linkin and Oracle office Oracle office Oracle office is Amazing by the way let's focus on this strip so let's uh make sure that all of these settings are filled we are going to start with General so it's basically filling the trip code by default it's asking me for duration let's make it 10 days and let's say 10 nights enable cut of time cut of time is from when onwards then people start booking this strip so I'm going to make sure that this is not enabled uh set minimum and maximum age going enable minimum and maximum age required restriction for this booking this trip let's not do it I I'm going to pick up a date and time I'll add a package and the first package is Tech offices and I'm going to click on edit pricing and let's label it as adult price is say 500 or say $50 per person let's make it $500 actually it makes more sense and let's save and close and let's add another package we are going to say downtown and downtown is $500 as well for adults okay and then let's save and close let's go to overview now we can have the section title as overview and let's call it I am going to show you around San Francisco and you you can also add trip highlights Tech offices Google Facebook Silicon Valley visit save and continue includes excludes so includes SL exclude section title let's let's call it food and accommodation cost includes title should be your food let's add list of Services food good living and miscellaneous expenses and let's make sure that the spellings are correct and cost excludes let's not add what cost excludes now you can add some pictures you can also add a map you can add a map image or you can add map iframe code so I'll say San Francisco and let's open it in Google maps and after I open it in Google Maps I want to make sure that I I add the iframe code of this area so let's do one thing um let's zoom into Union Square and let's let me go to the place where I have went because I know that place let me add a pin here and I am going to share this and I'm going to copy the iframe code embed a map and this is the iframe code and I can paste the iframe code here save and continue and you can add frequently asked questions uh is smoking during the trip allowed that's a very weird question but FAQ so let's say trip faq's no it's not please don't even think about it and let's click save and continue extra Services let's not add the extra Services extension for now and I'm going to publish this trip we can view the trip but before I view the trip you'll say that hey this website is not looking good what's going on what's up with this website now there is a problem with this website and the problem is that this website is not looking good and the reason that it is not looking good is that it is not using a better theme it's using 2024 theme which is not correctly I would say crafted for this plugin so let's do one thing if you go to your dashboard you will get this message which says you are just one step away complete WP speed travel engine activation now so let's click on this allow and continue and this is going to show me all the themes that I can activate now there are paid themes and there are free themes as well if you are serious about this website and you are making some money out of this website I would strongly recommend you buy a pro theme because it is very beautifully crafted it is going to make your website look really professional but for this tutorial I'm going to use a free theme so let's click on view themes let's click on get it now and after you enter your email address first name last name and download now it's going to send this theme to your email okay so once you do this you are going to get the theme I have already got mine so I'll go back to themes and I'll go to appearance and then themes and then add new theme and then I'm going to upload theme and then click on the choose theme button but and choose this theme so I have chosen this file and now I'll click install now this is the file which I received in my email for free after giving my name email and all those details let's activate this Theme by clicking activate and once you activate this theme you should see your website totally changed yes that's correct once you reload your website it's going to look like this amazing this is looking really great you can always change all these things you can go go ahead and start adding more trips you can click on view all to you can even change the footer now it's up to you and it's up to how you want to customize this you can change all these details you can uh start editing your pages you can start editing what you accept and the copyright message Etc I'm going to do one thing I'm going to add some more trips so let's do one thing let's go to the plugin WP travel engine and let's start creating a trip once again so I'll click on create a trip create a trip and let's call it Russia trip okay and let's add a package Russia package and for adult let me charge $1,000 per person save and close uh now let's publish it as is you can add more details obviously if you want to now if I reload my website I'm going to see this strip here you can always add the image and I strongly advise you to add an image because it is going to make your website look professional but as you can see that this is the T itary if you go to San Francisco trip I have added the it so day one what you are doing day two what you are doing cost includes what cost excludes what the map is visible this is the map that we um added by using the iframe code frequently Asked question questions are here now you can always go and edit this and I'll show you how to edit this if you go to your WordPress dashboard you can go to trips and you can start editing all these trips so if you go to edit the San Francisco trip you can always change all these parameters so if you realize that there was something that you missed while creating a trip you can always go back to the trip page and you can always change that for example I want to add the tour itary properly which I did not add it previously so day one we are going to go to Google office let us say Google office we will visit Google office and then let's add another dat Facebook office we will visit the FB office and meet Mark okay let's save and continue let's update and if I refresh this you'll see that the to itary is here so day one is Google office D to his Facebook office and you can add you can add even more and then you can always accept this form content into your email all right so let us say that you want to book this Russia trip so let's click on this Russia trip and I'm going to simp simply check availability and let's continue and let's add this to the card and let's proceed to check out I'll say Harry and then I'll say Harry at code with harry.com and then I'll fill in my details and I'll simply choose book now pay later and I'll click book now and I will be getting the booking here as you can see that uh my booking has been confirmed please check your email for confirmation and the admin can see the bookings here in the booking section so all you need to do is click on WP travel engine and click on bookings and you'll see that somebody has booked this and you can go and accept the payment and you'll see all the details okay so you can maybe call them you can ask for their number uh you can give them a call and you can say that hey you booked a trip should we confirm this this that other okay so this is how you do it you can send them an email and uh that that's how it works basically now this website gives me this message that this theme recommends the following plugins so it's always recommended to install these plugins and now we can uh install all these plugins so I'll say uh install I'll select all the plugins and I'll install the plugins and all the plugins will be installed and then activated so let's wait for it it's installing the plugins one by one I'm waiting for the plug-in installation to finish finish and yes it has finished so all the plugins have been installed if you go to your plugin section you'll see all these plugins are installed so all these plugins are installed let's activate them as well yeah we have activated the plugins so we'll go to plugins and we'll activate the a forms as well now if you scroll down after clicking on WP travel engine you'll see extend WP travel engine features with add-ons to provide amazing experiences to your guest and sell more with less uh less efforts so I'm going to click here and I'm going to click on login and I will log in into my uh account and as you can see that I have logged into my account and I can always activate this so I've purchased this Pro plugin now I'll go to plugins click on add new plugin and upload plug-in and I'll upload this plugin that I've downloaded and I'll click on install now and as you can see that this plugin is activated uh once I click on activate plugin and it says that please activate plug-in license click here to enter your license key and I'm going to activate this plugin by entering my license key so I have my license key I'll enter the theme license key here I'll go to my account and I'll copy the license key this is my theme license key I'll enter it here and I'll click on Save changes and this should activate my plug-in as you can see that it says sweet your license is active and I have this license active so now I can use all the pro features of this plugin and I'll click on begin installing plugins uh because these are all the recommended plugins that um this recommend so let's click on apply and I wants to actually install all these plugins so I'll have to select install and apply and as you can see that it is installing all the plugins for me as you can see all these plugins have successfully installed and I can now come back to my WP travel engine now once I went premium I can always go and use all these add-ons and for instance the strip fixed starting dates this extension allows travel agencies and tour operators to show trip fix starting dates and number of space visits for the booking so you can uh select all your add-ons the addons that you want to activate on your website and you can go ahead and activate them and uh you can always go and buy all these add-ons so uh this is how you can simply download this add-on I have already downloaded this add-on and I can now simply go back and I'll show you how to activate this add-on now all you need to do is go to the plug-in section add new plugin upload plug-in and I'm going to upload this plugin and I'm going to install this plugin and then in order to activate this plugin I'll click on activate and this plug-in has been activated now if you go to WP travel engine and you click on plug-in license Let me refresh this page now since we don't have any premium extensions it says premium extensions not found if you have any premium extension you'll have to activate the license by entering the license Keys here and you can get the license key after you purchase the premium plugins so you'll get all the features unlocked if you buy the um plug-in if you upgrade to Pro I hope that this video was helpful so I strongly recommend you go and try some of these plugins yourself uh so that you can create an awesome website and make sure you at least create one travel website after watching this video thank you so much guys for watching this video and I will see you next time"
u6b7Cix4zrQ,"[Music] welcome back to this course so far we learned a lot of things in Python and in this section I want to teach you about what AI is when to use AI how to use AI what is the wrong way of using AI because I have seen a lot of developers using AI in a wrong way and I think you should avoid it and this mentorship session is I think very important for you so when to use AI let's talk about it whenever you want to work on a bigger application you will always be tempted with AI if you don't know what AI is there are a lot of tools in the market we'll explore them one by one you might already know about chat GPD you might know about different llms you might also know about open source llms many of you might have used it you haven't used it do not worry after this section you'll be able to use them to their full potential I'll teach you how so for the entirety of this course I did not talk about Ai and I also did not talk about llms and do you know the reason the reason for that is I wanted you to learn everything step by step there was a reason behind everything I did in this course and not using AI was a very conscious decision I did not use AI to teach you because I didn't wanted you to use AI during your learning one of the biggest mistakes students are making across the globe is that they are using AI while they are learning now you can use AI to learn but when you're using AI while learning and you are practicing your problems and then you are using AI to solve those problems you are not going to learn anything so use as minimum AI help in solving practice problems as possible you should be very very raw when you are learning especially your first programming language and if it is python I would say do not go for AI at the beginning so now let's talk about how to use AI once you are at a stage where you have practiced a lot of problems you now understand everything in Python You Now understand all the concepts object-oriented programming and whatnot everything is very very clear to you you have written say 100 practice programs now you are ready to use AI whenever you are working on a big application it's always recommended that you automate the repetitive boring task for example let us say you always find yourself writing functions like average of two numbers capitalizing a string or maybe you are writing a very special function which is getting rid of all the commas in a given string you can use AI for that so whenever you are working with a program or a big application you should definitely use AI to save your time but the problem with using a lot of AI is that people tend to lose control of their applications when they writing AI generated code and sometimes they don't realize that they are losing control of the application but most of the code written in the application is being controlled by Ai and when I say controlled by AI the code is AI generated and the senior developer who is taking control of that application who is managing everything doesn't know how a particular module is working so much so that he simply relies on AI and prompting that should not be the case with your application otherwise you'll come to a point where you'll not be able to debug your applications with that said we'll talk about about how to use AI what is the best way to use AI so I'll split this video into five strategies the number one strategy is divide and conquer you should not prompt your AI and say something like give me an e-commerce website AI can actually try its best to generate an e-commerce website and I'm not saying that it cannot do that but again your e-commerce website will have certain requirements AI doesn't know what kind of e-commerce website you want to build you can definitely tell all that using the the prompts but the problem is that if you take control of your code and you start building yourself start using the correct Frameworks let's say you want to use flask you should start by creating a flask app you should do everything step by step and then you should break down that entire problem of building an e-commerce website into smaller problems and those smaller chunks should be generated by AI that too if required this is really very important sometimes people get dependent on AI so much that they keep on giving prompts and they don't realize that they are actually wasting their time and also they are spoiling their application at the same time and AI cannot write very good code and the reason behind that is that a lot of code written by humans that AI is uh trained on is not the best code okay so if AI is trained on bad data it is going to generate bad data so number one advice that I want to give you on using AI is divide and conquer and for the repetitive chunks for the obvious chunks of your code for example you want to write a function that should process a string a certain way and return it in a certain way you can always prompt it and in most of the cases you can always test that code and also you can use that code because you are not basically asking the AI to write the entire application now people whenever they think about AI they tend to use chat GPT or Google Gemini and sometimes um they use other tools there are a lot of tools in the market but the thing is sometimes you have the correct tool in the market made specifically for a given task for example if you want to write code you can download GitHub cop pilot and it has a free tier and we'll talk about GitHub co-pilot um later in the section but let me tell you that GitHub co-pilot has a free tier and it's an AI code editor for everyone you can get started for free and if you are aggressively using it then definitely you'll have to pay but again the thing is that its plans and pricing are very good because for free you can start using it and you can install the vs code uh extension and then you can get 2,000 completions we'll come to this we'll install it later in this section but again if you have a tool specific to a certain task you should not prompt chat gbt and try to use that tool and if that tool doesn't work for you then you can maybe go for chat gbt sometimes we have specific tool for specific tasks let us say there is an AI just for converting designs to code you should use that AI instead of going to chat GPT and pasting images into chat GPT if that makes sense now strategy three is going to be be very very specific with your prompts take some time out and write good prompts instead of saying something like write an e-commerce app I'll say write an e-commerce app for my mobile store and I want to sell mobile phones laptops and say some other electronic devices you can always type specific things you want to sell specific Pages you want to build and specific requirements that your website should follow so if you put your prompts very correctly frame them very nicely specific to the requirements you are going to get better results humans have become very very lazy these days and I would like to attribute that to AI that you have become very very lazy and because of this laziness they tend to type very small prompt and they expect AI to do everything but that's not the case the better the prompt the better the result if you refine your prompts and if you create your prompt templates I'll tell you what is a prompt template but before that let me tell you that if you specifically type a given prompt for a given task it will always perform better let's say you want to debug your python code you can create a prompt template and save it in a txt file and whenever you want to debug your code you can have that prompt template and use that prompt template and use that prompt in chat GPT by making those tweaks in the same prompt now how does it help let us say you want to work on an application which is an e-commerce website written using flask and python you can type down the specific details of your application and then at the end ask the question about that application so your prompt will start something like hey I want to build an application using flask I'm using FL SQL Alchemy I'm also using let's say a class which does this it has these these function fun but I want to add some more functions I want to solve this specific problem how do I do it in Python okay or generate code for doing this in Python and then you can change the last line for doing something else so you have that template saved already and using the template you can always create new prompts and save time so you don't have to write or spend time writing longer prompts all the time because you have your application specific prompts inside a txt file and this really helps me when I build larger applications always remember that sometimes a good prompt can make a huge difference strategy number four is do not rely on AI too much use your human brain to solve or prepare solution of a problem and then use AI to implement the game plan always use AI as an assistant and do not replace thinking with AI I repeat think using your own brain and do not use AI for creativity or thinking because that is something AI cannot do strategy number five is that humans tend to use AI to solve their problems until unless they writing code for production they don't use AI whenever they are practicing they don't use AI but there is a better way to use AI while you are learning you can generate practice problems using Ai and then take control of the problem start solving it give your answer to chart GPD or whatever AI you are using and then that AI will tell you what you did right what you did wrong you can ask it how could I have done better it will tell you you could have done better by doing this so all these things are going to help you a lot if you use AI for learning because the B basic concepts can be practiced using AI you don't need a practice book you don't need a set of practice problems you can simply generate practice problems using Ai and then you can give solution to those problems to Ai and then you can ask AI how you did and AI will tell you which are the specific areas you need to focus on and always work on training your mind human mind do not try to memorize things always train your human mind and you'll train your human mind only after making a lot of mistakes solving problem the wrong way yes you heard that right solving problem the wrong way is going to teach you a lot of things once you make mistakes you'll realize that yeah I could have done it better and then you will learn how you can do tasks in the optimal fashion always remember that at the end of the day you will become a better developer if you sharpen your human mind so always focus on sharpening your human mind do not memorize things and do not rely on AI too much I hope that was helpful and in the next video we are going to look into some AI tools and we'll see how we can use them and leverage them for writing code see you in the next video"
qxdEvuyLoEQ,in this video I'm going to show you how to use and configure super wall which is a way to show pay walls in your Android application we are going to see how you can show pay walls in your Android applications and you can do the same for flutter for iOS apps and I'll point you to the relevant links to the documentation but let's get started and understand how to configure Super Ball what problem it tries to solve and Hands-On demo using codlin so let's move on to a computer screen and let's get started so I'm going to start by navigating to the super fall homepage and we going to create a cotlin application in Android studio and then we'll see how we can integrate this Super Ball but before that let's understand what is the problem it's trying to solve you can actually build pay walls and test them without shipping updates now this without shipping updates is very important because in most of the cases when you have an app and you want to implement a pay wall you will have to ship update to your app and you will have your customers to update your app if you want them to see the changes to the pay wall but here you can integrate super wall and you can change your pay wall and edit your pay wall you can even use JavaScript and change color schemes without shipping updates we'll see how so let's start by signing up to Super wall I'll simply uh say I'll simply put my first name and last name and I'll simply use an email address and I'll use a password and then it's a asking me what is the name of your app I'll say super app super app is an Android application so we'll say super app is an Android app and I'll type in the company name and it's for Android and will'll use Scotland so let's hit create and after I hit create you can see that I am directed to a quick start guide so this quick start guide is first asking me to install the SDK I'll install the SDK while Gradle and uh in the meantime I'll fire Android studio now once you fire Android Studio your existing project will open but here what I'll do is I'll simply close the project and create a new project so let's hit new project and empty activity then I'll click next and I'll select groovy DSL because uh I want my build.gradle files instead of The Groovy build. gr. kts files so I'll simply name my app super app and let's make it 26 and hit finish and yeah it's creating a new Android application so I'll give it its time and in the meantime I'll go back to the Super Ball dos and I'll select Android gradel now for build. gradel I just have to copy this and I have to paste it in my app you can also use this one if you are using build.gradle do kts file but since I'm using build.gradle I'm going to go for this so let's come back and let's open the build. Gradle file I'll come back to Gradle scripts build. Gradle file for the module app and I'll put this as a last implementation let's see what else we need to do uh let's sync now let's run the gradal sync which is going to take some time and yeah in some cases it can even take up to 5 minutes if you have a slow PC but I am having a decent enough PC so I can call it a decent enough PC actually there was a time I used to call it a very super fast PC but thanks to the evolution of of chips and everything this is just a decent enough PC so anyways let's get back to business and let's copy these two permissions and I'll paste these permissions to Android manifest so Android manifest is a file where I'll have to explicitly tell my app that hey these are the two permissions that I need this app to use on the phone it is running okay so let's paste these and let's get back the next thing that I have to do is uh simply paste these per s I've done that then I'll have to copy and paste this activity so that uh our Android app can actually invoke this activity and show palls so let's copy this and let's paste it uh in the activity section so this is one activity and I'll add these activities so these are the activities that super wall needs to show screens in your Android application after it is configured okay so uh awesome now let's um come back to the quick start guide and let's go to the next step configure the Android SDK the next part is to configure the Android SDK so what we need to do is Select cotlin and we'll have to configure this by punching our API key here and I'll tell you in a while where you are going to get the API key so let's uh let's move to main activity. KT and after this line super. oncreate I'll paste super wall. configure and I'll get my API key from here so all you need to do is come to your settings then Keys copy the key and then you can paste this key so let's paste this key here and let's hit Alt Enter so that we can import super wall and you'll see that we are able to import super wall because we have it as a dependency in our build. Gradle this is very important if you don't have this dependency and if you haven't built your app with this dependency you are going to get into trouble anyways let's get back to business and let's get back to the quick start guide we are done with this step let's move on to the next step so I'll navigate to the quick start guide again hit next I have configured the Android SDK let's see how we can present a pay wall so in order to present a pay wall we'll have to Simply invoke this so we'll say super ball. shared. register and we'll name an event and whenever user is paid or subscribed to a paid only feature this should happen now this can be invoking an activity this can be navigating the user to some other activity this can be downloading a file from some secured Source Etc so let's copy this and let's paste it here so I'll simply paste it here and let's add a button here I'll change this UI which is created using compose and I'll get a button here which upon clicking will show the payall okay so let's uh get a button here but before I add this button let's run this app let's see this app is running we have this app up and running we are not facing any errors this is really very important if you don't have an avd created I will say create an avd because it's an important step so let's wait for this to finish and once this device is up and running I'll be back it takes some time and since I'm recording okay so the device is coming online but since I'm running Android Studio then I'm running the cvd and then I'm running my recorder it takes up some resources on this computer and yes it will take some time so if it is taking time for you go ahead grab some coffee and yeah uh it will take some time I'll be back once this is finished so guys as you can see that the CD is running and we can see hello Android displayed on the screen let's add the button so inside this button all I'm doing is let me show you the code and then we are going to run it and see how PS can be shown so this is a button and let me import button and we will import composable button and as for toast we are going to import Android toast and then we are going to import Android log and this is a register method which is in the super wall SDK so we are simply saying that whenever this button is clicked you show this text as a toast which is showing Pall now so showing P now will be displayed whenever I hit the button and then we are invoking super ball. instance. register and we are saying that invoke the event start workout and whenever this event is invoked user will be shown a pay wall and whenever a pay wall is shown to the user once he pays and once he subscribes to the paid feature he'll be shown and this code will be uh executed which in this case is a very simple log message and I'm saying the user has paid so this is a very simple log message the button has a text called filled so let's run this application and let's see if we can show the pball or not now let me give you a heads up uh let it run first the moment I click filled the payall is not shown but simply uh toast with this text has been shown and I'll tell you what the problem here is this particular ABD doesn't have Play Store so you'll have to make sure that your Android virtual device has a Play Store uh up and working and you should should sign in with your Google account and let me show you uh this app in action using my actual device so I'll uh run this app on my actual device and I'll show it to you so let me invoke this app and I'll show you how payall will be shown but before that we'll have to configure this pay wall and we'll have to come back here and we'll click next we have installed the SDK we have configured the SDK we'll present the p P wall and once we present the pay wall this will get checked automatically and the next step is configuring your products now if you want to add products you'll have to do it using play console and uh these are the exact steps for adding your products or Services which you want to offer to your customers you can even offer products and services through Revenue cat but let's come back here and let's add a pay wall so let's come back to campaigns and there is one campaign which is called example campaign and this example campaign uh has an event let me delete this event and we are going to create a new event here and we are going to see whenever this start workout event is triggered show a payall as simple as that so let's show the payall and this is a sample payall which we are going to show to 100% of the users now you can show some pay balls to some users and you can create as many pay walls as you want you can have three to four pay walls and you can test those pay walls and you can see which pay walls are converting well so all this you can do using super wall dashboard you don't have to ship any updates this is very important here and this is one of the reasons people use super wall and people should use super wall because you don't have to ship updates to your app and shipping updates to your app is very risky you might end up breaking something you might end up losing customers in case they are not able to update the app now let's see how we can edit this pay wall so we'll simply click this pay wall and we'll click on edit payall and as you can see that uh this particular interface opens now this is a very important interface and now you can click on all these components that form this payall you can even scroll down and you can change all this text and you can configure it to show your payall so let's say uh welcome to Sigma course and let's show these as a best course ever purchase course so let me click here and I'll say purchase course we can change this and we can also change the trigger so whenever somebody Taps this we are going to say that whenever somebody Taps this they should be able to purchase primary okay and let's create a new product so I'll say Sigma course let us say I have a course and the name of that course is Sigma course and I'll say plan ID is Sigma and automatically daily Pick offer trial is for 3 days free trial and then you have to pay uh 49 cents for say 6 months let's increase it let's say 1449 for a year and let's hit save and yes now you can change the interface and you can match it to your Android apps interface this is really very easy and convenient if you want to show pay balls so this is the payall and you can even add further products and uh you can use JavaScript here you can use custom CSS here and you can change uh the way your pay wall looks okay so let's now test this pay wall in our actual phone let's hit save and I'm hitting save it's updating the payall it sometimes takes some time to update the payall but let's wait for it so this is a physical Android device and I'm connecting it using a USB cable and I'll go and run the app and you'll have to make sure that USB debugging is enabled because if USB debug is not enabled you'll be in trouble so it is asking me to enable USB debugging should I allow it yes I'll have to allow it if I want um my app to work properly so let's now go and run the app from cotland so I'll simply run this app and it has detected the device and let's see if the app runs properly or not so yeah I'm waiting for the app to run and yeah it is running so now let's tap this filled and it is saying showing pay wall and it should show the pay wall that we have customized which means that it should show Sigma course and you can see that this pay wall is presented and we can configure all these buttons and I can always customize this pay wall to change without shipping updates to the app so I don't have to rebuild the app I don't have to do all the hard work all I need to do is go to the Super wall dashboard and change everything from there and my pay wall will be updated how cool is that so as you saw that we are able to show pay walls to the customers and we can even see which all the pay walls are converting so the basic idea of super wall is very simple you can show your pay walls you can customize your pay walls without actually shipping updates all from the Super Ball dashboard you can see which pay balls are converting well and you can change your pay balls to make sure that you are making good enough purchases so I hope that you like this video and if you want to know more about super wall I'll drop the links in the description make sure you create an account and try super wall uh which in my opinion is a game-changing product because it kind of changes the way you handle your Android app subscriptions so I hope you like this video thank you so much guys for watching this video and I will see you next time
XG9UfosbpNQ,hi everyone so uh I came here at Google IO connect in bangaluru and uh I got a chance to meet Manish who is director uh of Deep Mind India and I got a chance to ask him some questions and chat around so firstly Manish thank you so much for your time here uh because I know you have been very busy today and you still spared some time so first of all thank you for that thank you for having me thank you so much thank you so much so yeah so Manish I have some questions around AI which my audience would be very interested and especially I am also very interested in some of the answers and uh if they comes from a person like you I think we all will be enlightened so let's uh start with my first question which is what do you think how will AI change the way people work and specifically the developers work in the next 10 years how will it change yeah so I think will change everything uh uh I mean you can start with some very simple thing right so already today when you're let's say doing any coding you can see already there are AI based assistants right that can atically speed up your productivity right they can help you they can come up with suggestions you just need to describe at a high level and yeah I will suggeste code for you it can help you debug problems I mean we announced this 2 million uh context token context window which allows you to throw so much of code right at the Gemini model and it will help you yeah identify various problems with it but to me that is only like a like a super official way because AI I think just the kind of problems that you previously would have thought of as science fiction is going to enable that kind of a functionality so so the kind of problems that previously developers might not have even dared try and solve I think they will be able to attack those kind of problems so I think that will be the more profound change for developers amazing so tackle problem that you previously didn't even think okay would have been possible to solve yeah I mean who thought of flying in aeroplanes long back when early Humanity stage yeah yeah you are right so yeah thank you uh yeah so next question um is around uh can you share some successful case studies where AI has made a significant impact and specifically to light on some of the case studies where you think that this particular industry can be revolutionized with AI U tell us about some of your experiences there yeah so so I would say like already we have seen like things like Google Search right that people use and so on they have been powered by AI uh and and over the years right we have kind of really made it very easy for people to find answers and so on but I think what is coming is going to be completely at a different level correct uh so I'm personally very very excited about how AI is going to transform things like learning okay how we all learn yeah how it's going to transform Healthcare uh again which is again very relevant for India as a country we have such a severe shortage of trained doctors in any field uh and and I believe again AI is going to lead the way in terms of healthare becoming much more proactive much more consumer-driven where through AI based kind of nudges and so on right we all are nud to leave lead healthier lives and we get early signs of warning right about risk factors that we may be at and and and get early warning right to go and consult a doctor so I think it is pretty much going to impact uh our team has been doing a lot of work also in agriculture which has been a relatively untouched area correct but by analyzing satellite imagery right and building AI models we're able to solve some of the more foundational problems in agriculture like identifying field boundaries identify what is being grown and so on because through those you can start to build foundational layers to build Solutions like how do you provide access to loan for Farmers correct reasonably priced crop insurance as well as do the subsidy all of the subsidy programs and advisory to Farmers right in a much more precise ma correct correct amazing yeah uh so uh my another question is around uh your advice for buding software developers in this AI era specifically the ones who don't have a lot of initial resources what is your advice to all those developers yeah so my first and foremost advice would be uh uh take care of your fundamentals because AI is ultimately a lot of it is based on math okay uh so some of those fundamentals about linear algebra probability statistics optimization right it's good to to uh educate yourself right on some of the basics because then that model that you're using fails sometimes you have to go back to the basics right to be able to really solve the problem the other advice I would say is uh a don't be overwhelmed by technology but at the same time commit to lifelong learning okay none of us kind of the technology is evolving at such a fast pace that none of us can say oh I've learned enough I've picked up enough skills and now I'm all said for life you have to keep learning and exploring right throughout your life so I would say focus on the fundamentals and commit to lifelong learning as the primary advice I would say yeah amazing I think the fundamentals one I also totally strong very strongly agree with that because I didn't initially started with the fundamentals and the moment I switch back to fundamentals when you start with that the two node neural network you start you know understanding what all these llms and Transformers are about how these models are working so yeah great advice uh my next question is around uh the recent Gemma 2 variant which has exceptionally beat the other open- source counterparts my question about that model would be that model really crushed all the open source the other models what do you think made it happen is it the data that Google has is it the technique or is it something else I would like to know more first of all I mean I I think of all of us Google other companies and so on really developing is ultimately very healthy for the ecosystem so I do not like to think in terms of crushing somebody I think it's it's nice to have that healthy competition it's wonderful to see so many different companies developing these open models so so we are investing a lot right in various kinds of techniques right different kinds of innovative architectures right which are able to take advantage of whatever the data that we have right and really solve these problems in a fundamentally more scalable manner so there's a lot of work that we are doing on that right including there's been a lot of work both at Google and Elsewhere on things like mixture of experts right how do you exploit sparity in these methods and so on uh so so one is a lot of architectural work right on how do you build uh and then of course uh there's a lot of work happening in terms of after you do the pre-training of these models how do you do better like uh supervised fine tuning of these uh methods and then all of the rlf right the human feedback that you get and kind of you you uh get these uh models to become more aligned right with human values with with kind of human preferences and so on and do the right thing right for the human users so so it's a very very exciting uh field and now we see all of these like agentic capabilities being developed right on top of these llms which is again a very very exciting area so so really looking forward to the Entre like research Community right continuing to advance the Frontiers and and hopefully all of our users all of our developers and users ultimately benefiting benefited yeah a lot is Yet to Come obviously so yeah so uh my last question is around Vex AI so we know about Vortex Ai and we know how it is revolutionizing the way people build apps even people who never thought that they will learn coding are building apps using Vortex AI using the models switching different models and doing training and testing how do you think would it impact the developer industry because if everybody can make models using Vex then eventually um the the work the kind of work that developers were was were doing is shifted towards all these uh professionals I I would say what your take on that yeah yeah so I would say a I mean the developers have a very key key role to play in even picking the right problems right in a lot of these problems understanding the domain and understanding even which are the right problems to solve that's a very important correct decision right that you have to make and there's a lot of intellectual in some sense uh uh uh uh input right that goes into uh determining that so so I think right from like and and as I said as these AI models become more powerful I think the sky is the limit right in terms of the kind of problems that you can you can Sol so I think we should in some sense uh not think of it as AI versus human but really think of AI plus human correct how do we use these AI models right to augment the human capability and help us tackle much tougher problems and and in a far more productive Manner and with with much lower cost right for development correct correct yeah nice uh thank you so much for all the insights I mean it's great catching of with you especially at this event and thank you so much for your time and yeah thanks a lot yeah
2R4AIuAw9YU,guys I have always desired to have an app in my phone which can be used to control all the Wi-Fi networks that I have at home how cool would it be if I can control my devices from my app connected to my Wi-Fi network well fing is a network monitoring solution which helps you facilitate that and in this video we are going to explore it fing has around 22 million registered users 15 million plus scans and 4.5 plus trust pilot rating it is highly trusted for securing and managing network connections later in the video we'll see how we can install fing agent on this Rasberry Pi so that we can use the local apis that fing provides this video is going to be very fun I'm very excited to explore thinging let's move on to our computer screen and let's get started so as you can see I'm inside my computer screen and we are going to install fing so the very first thing that I'm going to do here is installing fing desktop now what is fing desktop it's an app that we can install on a machine so that we can have access to all the Wi-Fi data now click on login and we are going to create a new account on fing and after we create a new account on fing we are going to click here to download fing desktop and while this fing desktop is downloading we are going to talk about why we need fing and what exactly it is so as we already talked about it's a network monitoring solution and the top features of thinging comprises of these features number one it helps you get your device inventory which means that you have access to the list of devices that are connected to your network secondly gives you control over your network by letting you blocking the devices that you want so you have list of all the devices and if you want to block a particular device you can do that using thinging third thing is that you can track Network events like when was the outage it provides real-time notification on network events like outages new devices vulnerability and timeline for easy tracking you can limit anybody's internet connection you can detect hidden cameras you can track user activity you can use tools like Ping and DNS lookup to troubleshoot your networking issues and you can check your network speed and compar with the speed that your ISP promised you to give so talking about F's products there are primarily three products fing has number one is F's phone app which can be an IOS app or an Android app number two is fing desktop app which can be a desktop app and it is also available for Mac number three is an interesting one and it is fing agent for Rasberry Pi you can install fing on your Rasberry Pi and then you can use the local apis that thinging provides you can do pretty much everything that you can do on desktop and phone app by using fing on your Rasberry Pi we are going to see how to install fing on a Rasberry Pi very soon but before that let's explore fing app on our machine so fing has been downloaded on a computer now I'll open this app and I'll install thinging on my machine and I'm waiting for it to install and once it is installed I'm going to open it and let's proceed with the authentication it is asking me to authenticate let's click here and let's authenticate and boom I am inside my account now the moment I click on overview it has detected that I am inside my Rog strix g713 machine it is also detected that I'm using a tender router basically this is the name of my Wi-Fi network I can verify the speed I can test speed and it will check for network speed download speed as well as upload speed so my download speed is 91.6 and my upload speed is 92 93.1 or something amazing it it is also telling me about my ISP now these are the list of devices that are connected to my Wi-Fi network it has detected a router it has detected my laptop now these are some of the devices that I personally use and it is able to detect all these devices secondly I can always come to this security Tab and get an KN of how secure my network is it will show me all the warnings it will show me all the tests that passed and the test that needs attention now I can also use F's apis which are basically local apis by going to the URL but before that you'll have to click here you'll have to come to preferences and then you'll have to click on local API and you'll have to enable local apis as you can see fing is providing me the list of local API URLs I can always click here and once I click here you can see that it is showing me which device was connected when and whether it is currently connected or not so if it is currently connected the state will show as up otherwise the state will show as down you can see these are some of the devices which were previously connected but these are not connected as of now one of the devices being my Raspberry Pi now fing API allow developers and businesses to automate Network management the API provides access to device information event logs and network data we can use these Network apis like any other API and we can integrate it with a custom applications and use these apis like any other apis one of the best parts is that it also has an option to download the Open API specification so that we can get more information about our API and we can use all these apis effectively so it provides me two end points one is for seeing all the devices and the other for seeing all the people that are connected to the network now you can always set an API key to make your Fang API access secure and you can disallow some of the people that are on the same network and you don't want them to use the fing apis so we can always have an API key and you can pass your API key like this now obviously you can keep this API key more secure by making it longer but this is an example and in most of the cases you want your API key to be very small because you are the only person or you or somebody you trust are only the person that are using your API especially when you are on a home network now it is very easy to install thinging on your Rasberry P installing thing on a Raspberry Pi makes it very easy for us to access local apis plus Raspberry Pi is something which is always running so it helps us keep the fing app always alive now if you're looking for a guide on how to install fing agent on rber pie you can check out this guide which I'm going to link in the description this is the official guide that is going to teach you everything that you need to know about installing fing agent on your Raspberry Pi I am personally using this fing agent on my Raspberry Pi and it works like a charm now at the right side of my screen is the guide that is provided by fing and let me put the terminal at the left hand side and as you can see that I'm copying the commands that are present in this guide the first command is AP update and the second command is APD upgrade I'm going to give you the link of this guide so you can also follow along basically I'm simply following this guide and I'm copy pting the command the first command is AP install snapd I'm waiting for it to finish and then I'm going to copy Cudo snap install core and one by one I'll be running these commands I'm using OBS to record this screen on a Raspberry Pi so yeah it's little bit laggy in comparison to my regular videos but I think that should not be a problem I'm waiting for this command to finish and then I'll be pasting the next command we can use snap to install the fing agent which is why we are installing snap on a Raspberry Pi when I came across this guide I followed this and it pretty much worked so now I'm copy pasting this command to make sure that snapd is enabled and running I'm waiting for this command to finish and now the next step is to install the fing agent so let's copy this fing agent command and let's paste it and as you can see that snap is downloading fing agent and it will be installing it on my Raspberry Pi now why are we installing fing agent let us understand the very first thing that we are trying to do is installing fing agent on a Raspberry Pi and we are connecting our Raspberry Pi to our Wi-Fi now our fing app is running on the same same Wi-Fi our phone is connected to the same Wi-Fi which is why what happens is that this thinging agent can be directed by the fing app on our phone now once we configure this fing agent this fing agent can take over and it can basically start monitoring our Network and we will get realtime updates in all our devices even if they are off so our app will get all the updates even if you're not at home your app will get all the updates even if you turn off your laptops you can have all the monitoring data sent to you through the fing app because your fing agent is running your Raspberry Pi is running the fing agent which is taking care of all these things the fing agent takes care of monitoring the network and sending all the data to your phone once it is configured one of the things that I really liked about this sing agent is that it sends real time emails also you don't have to open the thinging app wherever you are if you have access to your emails you can get emails like this and you have all all the monitoring updates of your Wi-Fi at home or work so let's see how we can configure this fing agent now as you can see I'm inside of my phone screen and it says fing agent has been detected now I am the one who has installed this fing agent so I'll acknowledge it and now I'm going to click on this location button and it basically takes my address I'm going to click on home to make sure that this is marked correctly and then I'll click on done now as you can see it is showing me all my devices is it has detected all the devices that I have plus it has detected this Rasberry Pi where I've installed this ping agent now that we have understood fing apis it's time to build an app so I'm going to use this local API and I'm going to build an app with this local API as you can see I'm also opening chat gbt just in case and I'm creating a main.py which is going to be our flas cap but before that we'll have to install flask so let's pull up our terminal and I'm going to type pip install flask and flask will get installed make sure that you have python installed already and now I'm going to create a static folder and a templates folder so that I can create my static files and my template now let's start coding this app I'm going to import flask and I'm going to create a basic flas cap in order to create this flas cap and also I'm going to create a dashboard. HTML which will render a dashboard and as you can see that I've created a dashboard. HTML here so let's start coding a app I'm going to say from flask import flask and then we are going to import render template and jsonify so let's do that and also we are going to say app is equal to flask and we are going to say underscore uncore name and that is going to create our app now we are going to create some endpoint I'm going to create two endpoints here but before that we'll also import request and we we are going to Simply say request.get and we are going to put the URL here this is the local API make sure that this is local API and is not going to work on somebody else's device and let's say R is equal to request.get and after I say R is equal to request. get I can always do r. Json but I can always go to the documentation and verify this so you can always go to request documentation I'm sure it's r. Json but again you can go to the documentation and you can always verify r Json is going to give you the pared dictionary with all the data so say network data is equal to r. Json and we have all the network data here now what we are going to do is create two endpoints the first one is going to be a slash and this will be our main dashboard so let's say def dashboard we are creating a function and now we are going to return render template I'll return my dashboard template and I'll pass in the network data devices so say devices is equal to network data devices so there is a key called devices if you look at the API response we are using that data and I'm going to populate my dashboard. HTML using some basic HTML I have some tables here and we are using Ginger templating and I'll also populate style. CSS this is very basic table and CSS Styles now let's say app. run so that we can test our app and we'll do debug is equal to true so that the debug is on the flash cap has been started now we'll control click here and let's see if it works control click to open the app and wow it is showing me all the devices the network devices dashboard is here you can see the IP address the state the name of the router and device and you can also see that when was it first seen and when was it changed which is amazing and I am also adding another Endo here which is going to show me the devices and it is going to be an API it is going to be a Json resp response now the thing is you can always change this Json response I am putting the Json response as it is but the idea of this route is that you can always change the network data and you can always change the way thing is showing the apis through your flash cap so basically your flas cap is showing this Json data Let's test it out/ devices and you can see that we have created our custom API so if you want to show some additional fields or maybe you want to remove some Fields you can always do processing here and then you are going to get the results in/ API SL devices how cool is that so yeah that was all about this video if you want to access the apis and if you want to get more features from fing you can always upgrade to starter plan or Premium plan you can always sign up and use the free plan and you get up to three scans per day internet speed test and other features but if you are somebody who wants to get more control over your network you can always go to starter or Premier plan and you can get unlimited automated scans 7 Days of event timeline and automated Security checks you can also get hidden camera detector if this is something that you want all for just $24.99 per year which in my opinion is a great pricing if you are looking for network security you are just paying $25 a year and same goes for Premier if you are a business user and you want continuous monitoring and you want to use thing very aggressively you can always switch to Premium plan and that should get the job done for you so some of the real life use cases of fing are that it protects you from intrusions it helps you detect hidden cameras in public networks and rentals like lbnb it can also help you set internet downtime for your personal well-being and it can also help you trouble shoot your network issues with Smart Tools so I'll put the link to thinging in the description and you can check it out download it try the free plan for sure and if you like it you can always upgrade so I hope this video was helpful thank you so much guys for watching this video and I will see you next time
UaQZAr2cTV8,"in this video I'm going to talk about which hosting is the best for WordPress and what exactly this hosting is why should you worry about hosting and how hosting impacts your website be it your WordPress website or any other website for that matter before I explain you what exactly hosting is and why hosting is important and which hosting to use I'm going to talk about what exactly is hosting so there is a concept of client and a server client is basically the person who is consuming the website server is a person who owns the website and physical location of that website so basically server will contain all the files which are responsible for generating HTML CSS and JavaScript your server will generate some of the data in the form of HTML CSS and JavaScript and it will send it to the client client will in turn parts that content and that content will then be served to you through your browser in the form of a very beautiful web page so client is responsible for consuming the website and viewing the website server will query the database it will go to the database maybe query the the database to fetch some specific records based on the client's request and then it will send it back to the client so this is a very simple process which occurs in almost every type of website in any type of Hosting you need a server to store the files which will serve the client and this is required to host your website and this server is something that we call hosting now that you know what exactly hosting is let's understand why hosting is important choosing a best hosting is important because it impacts your site speed and your site speed is directly proportional to your Google search rankings any website wants to rank in Google search and generate more and more traffic be it a Facebook be Google or any blog that you are writing you want your website to generate as much as traffic as possible and in order to do that you will want your hosting to work best you want it to be very fast and you want your users to have good experience while using your website now there is this concept of CDN which stands for Content delivery Network let me explain what exactly is CDN and how it can make your website really fast let us say I have a server in Alaska from Alaska let us say there is a user user will get the data directly from the Alaska server now consider a case where Australian users are requesting data from the Alaska server what do you think will happen the data will go from Alaska server all the way to Australia and yes it will impact the site speed in a very similar way if an Indian user comes the data will go from Alaska all the way to India and yes it is going to impact the speed of your website what is the solution a very basic solution is to cash the data whenever first request is Made in India and also in Australia so whenever a second user or third user or fourth user comes back to receive the same web page he will receive the cached version directly from India which will be cached in India and Australia respectively this way the website will be very fast and your users will have the best experience out there because they are going to receive data directly from their country instead of receiving it from Alaska so these are some of the factors that you need to consider while choosing a hosting for any website it might be WordPress website it might be say flask website Jango website you might be working with angular or it might even be as simple as a static website you need to choose the best hosting whenever it comes to your website now that you know what hosting is let's understand what types of hostings exist in the market the first hosting I want to talk about is the cheapest one and it's called shared hosting the concept of shared hosting is very simple your hosting provider will give you a server and he will give the same server to other clients such that all the clients are going to use the same physical resources which will be shared amongst all the users now there might be 100 users thousand users or even 10 thousands of users using the same server same machine the speed might be impacted but it is the cheapest form of Hosting this type of Hosting is intended for hobby websites websites with non-s serious projects let us say you want to host something but you are not very serious about it and there are some of the websites which you know that only few people will use let say you have a team of five people and you are deploying a website for five people you might want to use shared hosting because first it is not a very critical website so you don't want it to be up all the time and it is going to save you a lot of money because it's shared hosting it's shared among different people and all those people are using the same server so you are happy your hosting provider is happy as he makes a lot of money by charging all the customers for the same resources now there is second type of Hosting called Cloud hosting Cloud hosting is the new type of hosting in the market a concept where your site lives on the cloud that is your hosting provider will say that do you want me to host this website on my resources you'll say yeah I want to host this website on your resources he'll take the website and he'll host it simply and give you a link how you should not worry about how he's doing it how he's managing everything it's on the cloud and it's available and you can even scale it up such that if a lot of users comes to your website your users will not be impacted but definitely you'll have to pay more by scaling up this is a very good option for people who don't want to understand what hosting is they don't want to focus on all these things they don't want to focus on TX and they just want the website to go live somehow and focus on their business instead of focusing on hosting Tech cloud and all these things now the third type of Hosting I want to talk about is VPS it stands for virtual private server now let's understand what it is your hosting provider will give you SSH access to a server which actually will not be a real server it will be a virtual server how does it work your hosting provider will have some infrastructure in the data center and from that data center he will somehow give you access to a virtual private server basically he's running a software behind the scenes and he's giving multiple people access to his Resources by providing virtual private servers it will seem to you as if you have a 2GB say 512 TB memory and dis space but it will actually not be a physical server it will be a virtual private server but you will have no way to see that it is a virtual server it will just work like a dedicated server of 2 GB Ram 512 GB of storage or maybe 1 TB of storage or maybe 8 GB Ram 1 TB storage and it is going to be cheap because your hosting provider will actually share the RAM and resource and other stuff he has the option to do that is what I mean and which is why on the same infrastructure he will serve a lot of customers but hosting providers customers will see that server as a dedicated server which will be a virtual server actually but it is going to be cheap it just works fine and I personally like virtual private servers a lot because it helps you practice Linux and also it is one of the best options out there with minimum outage sometimes yeah you might see the resources bottleneck but again it's the best option sometimes specifically when you want to prototype something and understand how things are working behind the hood then comes dedicated hosting and in dedicated hosting you actually get a server which you own it is a dedicated server you get the physical 2 GB of RAM or 8 GB of RAM or 16 GB of RAM whatever you want to do with the machine will be physically done with the machine nobody is sharing that machine your hosting provider has that machine ready for you and you are paying for that machine you are paying for the resources you are paying for the electricity consumed for that machine and you have SSH access to that machine nobody else is using it there is no software installed you get to decide what to do with your machine your hosting provider has left that entire machine for you now there is a concept of managed hosting and it's my personal favorite when it comes to Wordpress what exactly is managed hosting managed hosting means that your provider will say that this particular website will be hosted by us you don't have to worry about anything let us say I want to write a block called blog withth harry.com blog withth harry.com will be given to that person who is giving me manage WordPress hosting and all this will occur through a dashboard definitely let us say I am buying Elementor hosting I want Elementor hosting which is a managed hosting for WordPress I'll go to the element dashboard I will simply host my website I will get a link and a link to the wp admin I don't have to worry about errors I don't have to worry about PHP I don't have to worry about which databases installed I don't have to worry about auto updates which might bring your website down I don't have to worry about all these things I can simply go to the dashboard and manage my website through my WordPress dashboard it's easy it's for pros and also it saves you from a lot of Errors because no matter how good of a developer you are you will encounter errors and when it comes to Wordpress you might see phsp errors you might see my SQL errors and sometimes your plugins might be the reason of your errors manage WordPress hosting will solve all these issues for you because it's being managed by your hosting provider your hosting provider says to you that you want to host five WordPress websites right just pay us for the five WordPress websites and we'll give you the WordPress dashboard and whatever is required by you you don't have to worry about VPS you don't have to worry about which code is going where you don't have to worry about PHP versions you don't have to worry about which my SQL line is throwing which error everything is managed by your hosting provider and it is really very reliable because your hosting provider knows much better than you what problems are being hosted in your servers an average typical user might fail to deliver the website with 100% up time but your hosting provider will not fail because they have been doing this for years and Elemental hosting is one of the best hostings out there because you get Elementor Pro Plan with Elementor hosting I recommend Elementor managed hosting because first of all it is managed and if you want to host a WordPress website Elementor hosting is the best out there hands down for $9.99 you are getting managed hosting you are getting Elementor Pro features and it is optimized for elementary you might go for some other hosting provider and install Elementary there but it is never going to be better than managed Elementor hosting with Elementor add-ons because Elementor hosting is optimized for all these things so if you're looking for a WordPress website you might want to buy managed WordPress hosting from Elementor and you have four plans in Elementor hosting one is basic then business then we have grow and then we have scale if you want to get started with Elementary hosting you can go with the basic plan otherwise you can go with the business plan you get more storage in business plan and more number of monthly visitors now I see a lot of Hosting where they say we have unlimited bandwidth you can have as many users as you want but in my personal opinion there is no free lunch and there is always some sort of limit at place you cannot have unlimited users on your website for say $10 or $15 never it's not possible and one thing I like about elementary is that they specifically mention that your basic plan will be able to handle at least 25k monthly visitors then your business website will be able to handle at least 50k monthly visitors if you want grow plan then you get three websites with 75,000 monthly visitors and if you want to scale you are basically running a WordPress websites business you can go for the scale plan which in my opinion is great because you get to host 10 websites for $449.99 $5 per website what else you want from them and all this comes with Elementor Pro which is cherry on the cake if you're using Wordpress there is a good chance that you will use Elementor and what I like about this is that Elementor is included with all the plans be it the basic plan or scale plan you get the elemental Pro another cherry on top of this Cherry is that you get the best experience because Elementor hosting is optimized for Elementor Pro plugin so there is a lot of value included to be honest if you go for Elementor hosting so I'll give the link in the description and you can simply check it out for different hosting plans from Elementor and let me know in the comment section what you think do you use Elementor for your websites and do you agree with me when I say Elementor hosting is the best hosting plan for WordPress now let's conclude this video by talking about different factors that might impact hosting of your website the very first Factor I want to talk about is that do you want a basic prototype of your website or do you want to host a serious website if you want to host a serious website with as less downtime as possible you might want to go for Elemental hosting or some sort of serious hosting but if you want to just prototype your website you are in college you want to show it to your teacher just for an hour you might want to go for shared hosting it is going to be the best for college students who are not looking for some serious websites they are learning they are simply showing the assignment to the teacher sometimes you also might want to build a website as a prototype to show your boss or to show somebody or just to experience how WordPress Elementor works you can go for shared hosting because it is going to be the cheapest now let's say you start a hobby block and you don't have a lot of money in your pocket you might want to go for cloud hosting because Cloud hosting plans are really good these days and also you might go for a VPS because you get a VPS for $4 $5 there are different type of services to get VPS you can go search for different hosting providers who are providing the VPS services but you got the point you will learn a lot of Linux if you are working with VPS plus VPS are cheap you can do different things on the same VPS because I'll tell you an incident where I was using a VPS for my Python Programming I was doing some WordPress hosting on that and also I had some notes hosted on the same VPS and I was using this $5 VPS for all bunch of different things I was using it as a Google Drive clone because I was storing a lot of files in there and there was a python HTTP server which I was using to download files so in a $5 VPS you can get a lot of things done I don't want to open my laptop all the time I sometimes want to use these type of VPS where I can do something which will run overnight I don't want to run my laptop overnight for one it might harm my laptop secondly I don't want to take the risk of turning on my laptop all the time because I don't want my electricity to go through my computer and my socket board all the time might have nothing to do with you but this is my personal opinion I prefer VPS if I want to run an overnight Python program or an overnight build process it's simply easy for me simply go and log into the SSS terminal of the VPS and you are good to go simply run the program whatever you want to do run it through no Hub program am person press enter close the VPS shut down your computer wake up and see how much that process ran as simple as that secondly the location of data center is also important there are some hosting providers who do not provide CDN you might want to check for that and also there are some hosting providers where CDN locations are very limited you don't want to choose a provider who are not providing their CDN services or who are not providing services in important parts of the world the third thing I want to talk about is customer support whenever you are choosing hosting customer support is really very important you might think that I might not need customer support but whatever hosting you use customer support is very important what if you are making some mistake everything is working fine but you are just not able to figure something out and you want to know how this particular thing will happen in certain dashboard and you want to figure out how to do a certain thing in element dashboard or say some other hostings dashboard how will you do that you might want to talk to customer support and it really feels good and you will be highly satisfied while buying the hosing if you know that for me a 24/7 support is ready to answer the questions the fourth thing I want to talk about is the dashboard dashboard should be very user friendly I have seen some hosting providers who provide minimal dashboard and sometimes the important functionalities are hidden for example let us say I want to reinstall WordPress or reset my website that option will be hidden deep within some options you don't want to buy those hostings because it will take a lot of your time plus always go for Reliable hostings so that even even if you learning the dashboard you are ready to host the websites of your clients or your future websites to the same sort of Hosting now last but not the least I would like to talk about emails let us say I am buying a website called blog withth harry.com I might want to get an email address Harry blog withth har.com or support at theate blog with.com these things are really very important because email marketing and email is very important these days a lot of companies these days generates millions of dollars through email marketing so email marketing is really important and for getting email marketing to work you will need to get your email and easier it is to set up your email better it is always choose a hosting provider which is providing you the email Services Elemental hosting provides the email Services which in my opinion is a very good thing so that was all about hosting and which type of Hosting you should choose for your websites let me know in the comment section what you think about elementary hosting and do you even want to consider Elementary hosting in the future because I have mentioned my reason of choosing Elemental hosting in this video but what do you think after watching this video and which type of hosting do you think is the best I hope you found this video insightful thank you so much guys for watching this video and I will see you next [Applause] [Music] time"
OAVOl-aSOJc,"so guys in this video I'm going to show you how you can create a blog like this we have light mode we have dark mode I'm also going to show you how you can draw attention to a line after you write some code in your blog I'll show you how to add this copy button I'll also show you how you can draw attention to a certain word what if you want to just highlight banana or what if you want to just highlight fruits. length I'm going to show you how to do that also we'll create this on this page which you must have seen in different websites now the moment I click on objects this is going to scroll and the moment I am going to click on control flow this will scroll to control flow the best part about this is that this is all automatic you don't have to manually write code for individual blog to make it work so we'll see how to make this automatic and also I'm going to show you how to create this glass-like effect using Tailwind CSS the about page looks amazing the contact page looks amazing we'll build it from scratch I'm going to use Shard CN UI now please don't click away from this video because I know the moment you hear different new technologies you might think that this is not possible for me because I don't know Shad C and UI this is not possible for me because I don't know markdown or maybe you don't know Tailwind CSS but rest assured I'm going to show you how this blog is built step by step and I'm going to show you the right way to do it also this blog is responsive so if I switch to iPhone 12 this is going to appear like this and you can see that we have this mobile navigation menu and if you scroll down you'll see all these FAQs and you can design this blog but I'm going to focus on functionality more than the blog itself so let's get started with this blog I'm not going to waste any further time we'll see how all these pages will be created we'll see how this dark mode light mode all these things will be created using nextjs so yeah you'll have to install nextjs and if you don't know nextjs and if you just to react that is also fine I'm going to explain you each and everything step by step so let's get started so let's open nextjs talks and we are going to create a new application so get started and to create a new nextjs application we need to Simply run this create Next Step at latest so if I copy this and if I paste it in the terminal so let me open Terminal shift right click I have this folder called awesome block PW now I have this folder and I'm going to open this in terminal and I'm going to copy this command and then I'm going going to paste this command in this terminal so let's type this npx create next app at latest this is going to ask me what is your project named now if you type the name of your project it will create a folder with that project and if you want to create your nextjs app in the same directory you can put a dot by putting dot it will spread all the files here do you want to use typescript I'll say no do you want to use eslint I'll say yes or maybe we can use typescript if you want we can use typescript because a lot of people say that typescript must be used so let's use typescript es lint yes Tailwind CSS yes SRC directory no and then app router yes would you like to customize the default import alas no because nextjs provides a default import alas which I don't want to customize now these options might be different for you because these options are based on your previous preference if you already have this create Next Step installed you might have different options and you will have to use arrow keys to change those options so as you can see this app has been created let's check the folder yes it has a lot of files now now I'm going to shift right click and click on open with code to open this in vs code now this has opened in VSS code for me awesome PW block now let's open this terminal and we'll say pnpm runev now you might say what is pnpm pnpm is simply brother of npm pnpm and I don't want to spend a lot of time but simply install pnpm if you want the caching to be very efficient so how do you install pnpm you can simply go to your terminal and say npm I minus G pnpm oops pnpm pnpm and this will globally install pnpm and then you can use pnpm I don't want to spend a lot of time on pnpn and you don't have to either so let's run this pnpm run Dev command and as you can see see that I have this local Lo 3000 app running this is a brand new nextjs app which we are going to customize and we are going to create our blog using this app so let's go to page. jsx now if you don't don't know what is page. TSX if you're using typescript now if you don't know what is page. TSX this is the entry point now the next GSA router is based on file based routing which means that your app folder will have all the routes now the page. TSX file will ser slash route if you create a folder inside app let us say if we create a folder called about SL page. TSX now page. TSX will be responsible to serve slash about endpoint okay now we are going to go to extensions and we are going to install an extension called es6 react Redux Snippets so es6 react es7 I I think it's called react react native es7 stets and I guess I have already installed this so I don't have to but I want to show you that this extension will be used it's called es7 plus react Redux react native Snippets make sure you install this by dsz nasar and I'll tell you why you have to install it once you install it you can type ra fce and this will create a react functional component okay so we can simply call this a about and the moment you type RFC you can type about and this changes the content and the export default the name of the component about so all you have to do is rafc and type about and you are good to go now if I go to slash about I'll show you that we have this about but we don't want to keep a page this simple we want to create a blog that looks like the one we saw during the demo so let's go to our vs code and let's install shat CN UI now what is shat CN UI okay so it's not a component library but it's I'll show you it is not a component Library if you go to docs it tells this is not a component Library it's a collection of reusable components how do you install it simply install it using pnpm you can go to installation then since we are using nextjs I'm going to click on nextjs and we have already created our nextjs app so we'll copy this command the moment you press this copy button you are shown some options are you using npm or Yan or pnpm simply copy the pnpm paste it press enter and yes we have installed Shad CN UI so it will ask you few questions it is asking you which style would you like to use I'm going to go with default you can try New York as well later it simply makes your component look little bit different but let's go for default and I'm going to go for slate and I'm going to keep this really simple would you like to use CSS variables for colors yes and let's wait for it to install it will install in few seconds so success yes it has installed and shat CN has been installed now we'll have to install all these components individually let me showcase shat CN to you very quickly if you go to components we have accordion we have alert we have alert dialogue if you go to accordion you can get this by copy pasting this component I'll show you how you can get this but let's see what it can provide you can get this alert component which looks something like this you can get the alert dialogue which looks something like this it really looks cool and then you can get an avatar you can get a spec ratio I'll tell you why it is useful and then you can get a badge like this you can get breadcrumbs like this and then you can use buttons and now buttons is really simple but again it helps you create different types of buttons we'll we we'll see why we should use sharp CN buttons and then calendar looks something like this then we have card which looks something like this and then we have carousal which looks something like this now you can always create these carousal using Tailwind CSS using JavaScript I know you can do it you know you can do it but the thing is chart CN saves a lot of time now charts is something new you can use chart and you can have different sort of charts and if you use default the chart is going to look something like this and if you use New York the chart is going to look something like this okay it's matter of choice you can always customize it and yeah accept terms and conditions this is checkbox then we have collapsible now collapsible looks something like this and then you have combo box you have a lot of components you have a resizable component which is really difficult to create at least time taking to create if not difficult and then we have a switch we have a toast like sonor if you click here something like this pops up we have text area and why text area text area is there in HTML right no text area is there in HTML but it doesn't look something like this this text area is cooler than the one that we get in HTML and then you have the tole you have the tole group then tool tip toast toast looks something like this then we have toggle toggle looks something like this let us say you want to enable dark mode it will highlight it something like this and then if you click it again it will remove the highlight and then toggle group it looks something like this you can toggle different sort of things if you want to uh create a Wiig editor this is this is an example from a viig editor if you don't know what Vis editor is let's not discuss much about it's not the topic of this video then we have this tool tip the moment you hover it's going to show you some text all these components can be used very conveniently just by installing it and the best part is you don't have to install all the components at once you can install the ones that you really want to use this is the the best part about chaten because it keeps your application lightweight now let's get back to vs code and let's start creating our Blog Page let's let's start by creating a Blog Page how do we create a blog page we can go to app and we can say blog and then we can say/ page. TSX okay this is a Blog Page and then we can have a blog post page which will be blogpost slash and then slug do TSX now you might be wondering what exactly is this slug dtsx in fact I should create a slug folder and then inside the slug folder there should be page. TSX so let me fix this real quick page. TSX and then there should be a slug folder and then inside the slug folder there should be this page. TSX let me move it inside the slug folder I think I created a file called slug my bad let me remove this so inside my blog post I want to create a folder called Slug and then inside this slug folder I want to move this page. TSX okay so we have this about folder and then inside the app we should have this blog post folder all right so this is how the app looks now we have this app folder then we have about then we have a Blog folder and then we have a blog post folder inside which we have a slug folder and then page. TSX why do we have this slug folder because we want to use something called Dynamic routes in xjs and I'll show you how it works so let's go to our about page and you can see that we have our page. TSX right here and we can write our about page very easily but before that I want to show you how we can create a block page so let's get started by writing our blog page because that is the simplest thing that we can do after installing chat CN now I want to use buttons from chat CN now since I've installed chat CN I want to show you something now if you go to your global. CSS it has actually added some CSS here and then it also has Tailwind which you can see from Tailwind doc config.txt it to our root layout now we have a layout. TSX here let's paste it and also I'm going to very blindly copy this and paste this why why am I saying blindly because I don't want to focus much on fonts at this point I'm going to follow what chat c and documentation is saying and then let's copy this body tag also and I'll I'll explain you what the CN is let me copy this first and this is the body tag and CN should be imported Quick Fix add import from lails and yes it works you can also type this out if the option doesn't show up but it should okay let's get back and let's see is there anything else that we need to do no we don't so we need to import font family in our Tailwind Doc conf.js in our case this is TS because we are using typescript and if you don't know typescript do not worry I'm going to show you everything just follow along and you'll learn everything so import font family from Tailwind CSS slash Tailwind CSS SL default theme if I'm not wrong yes Tailwind CSS SL default theme yes now this is required but I'm using common JS okay so sorry I'm using modules this is common JS so let's now copy this and add it to extend so you see this extend here you need to paste it to your extend now this part might seem little boring but you have to do it and all I'm doing is following the documentation and trust me I'm going to explain you what the CN is about but after some time after some time I'm going to explain you what the CN is so let's move and let's start building a page UI okay now I'm going to create a folder called components where I will add my components now this is already created if you are using nextjs 14 or 15 now I'm going to click on this plus icon and I'm going to say Max with rapper. TSX okay this is a component now this component will help out by creating a Max width wrapper around your application so sometimes what happens is you have to create a Max width wrapper around your components and it gets really difficult uh because you have to add that Max width wrapper to each and every component I'm going to import CN and I'm going to explain what this CN is in a while let's say add class name to this Dev the first class name is MX Auto MX now what is MX Auto MX Auto and Max width screen Excel Max width and MX Auto are used to Center something so if I have something written here it will be centered to the screen and also I want to use width full so that this gets a full width and then margin y of 12 I want some margin at the top of my components uh all the components wherever I wrap this Max withth I'm typing my13 because I need a margin y of 12 and then we'll have an input class name that we will receive as props to this component okay now we have class name here and then we'll have children here because this is a wrapper children and since we are using typescript we'll have to create an interface and let's create an interface called Max withd props interface Max withd props so we have class name which is a string and then we have children which is nothing but react. react node react node yes so we have this interface and now the error is gone so all we are doing is we are saying that hey wrap anything that this Max width wrapper gets inside a div children okay now I'm putting children in here and as you can see this will wrap this children okay now I'll show you why we did this and let me show you what this CN is now CN is a function that will allow you to merge two different classes entailment CSS now let me first tell you that why we need the CN function this is a function that shaten gives us now let's say you have a class MX Auto M Max W screen XEL and W full now let us say you want to add another class which is called my class and you want this my class to override all the CSS properties that are coming from these individual classes do you think this will work no this will not work because we don't know in what order this CSS is going to generate this is done by Tailwind CSS so in order to merge two classes such that the later class gets the priority we need to use the CN function now some people still have this this misconception that if you add a class after something let us say if I say flex and then I say block now some people think that the display of this div is block but no we don't know whether it's Flex or block if you want it to be block if you want that if a block is added after Flex it should take preference you need to use CN function so in order to make this work we will use CN and since we are using JavaScript we'll have to W it in curly brackets and let's do this and also let's merge okay so let us say I want to merge this with another class I can add that another class here okay now what is that another class obviously that another class is class name this is getting an input now why am I typing class name here so this Max withth rapper is actually a rapper which will get class names you should be able to add class name to this component and whenever you add any class to this component that class should take the priority and in order to give priority to that class you need to use CN function and you need to put this class name as the second parameter of CN function so this div will have these classes but if I give another class through props those classes should get the priority I hope that is clear okay if it's not please please watch this part of the video again now let's come back to page. TSX not this one but this one the homepage. TSX which has all the next year's things inside so if you go to the homepage of this app you will get you'll get this 3,000 my bad Local Host 3,000 I think the app is not running I'll have to run the app what is it pnpm run Dev this was not running I think I restarted my terminal but that should be fine it should work now local 3,000 this works and yeah this page is not looking very good because we have added CSS from Shad CN and we are going to fix this in a while so let's do one thing let's come back to this main tag let's remove this main tag and let's re this main tag again and we are going to add a nav bar to the entire app so how do you do that you do that using layout. TSX and also I don't want the title of this to be create next app I want it to be programming with Harry and also I'm I want the description to be the description of programming with Harry now there is a good practice here and the good practice says that you should have a config folder where you should be able to configure your variables okay so how do we add a config folder you can add a config folder by simply creating that config folder and we can configure things using this config folder so config slite dots okay let's let's say export default and let's export a export an object so I'll say title and let me cut this and call this config site config and let's say const site config is equal to title programming with Harry and the thing is that you can import this from site dots so where is my layout I just closed it so you don't have to type it out because in future you can change it so site config let me import site config do title okay so the sign config has been imported and then we have siteconfig do title and then we'll have site config do description description and let's add description here so description oops and programming with Harry is a Blog for your programming doubts we'll we'll generate it using chart gbt so the thing is that you can generate it using chart gbt also if you have your site config at one place and you don't want want to type boring things you can always generate it using chart GPD okay let's go back to a page and let's see how it looks so we have the title set we should have the description set if you go to right click view page Source we should have the description set so if you go to programming we have the description we have the meta description set this is very important for SEO guys okay now let's add a navbar component so I'll come to components and I'll create a file called navbar navb bar. TSX ra fce and then press enter let's create a Navar so let's return nav and I'm going to create a nav bar here and nav will have a class of flex class name is equal to flex display flex and then we have a UL inside this and then we have Ali inside of this and lii will have some links and Link will come from next link so we say import link from import link from next link and then we have link HF href is equal to slash and then inside this I'll say home and then we'll say about we'll say about so Li link about and then HF will be about HF is equal to slash about and let's see how it looks it should not look very good but it should not look very bad either we don't have used the Navar component yet so let's go to layout. TSX let's close to to the right and also let's close this global. CSS and s. I'll add the nav bar right after body above the children so let's add the nav bar here so let's let's say Navar and it's automatically imported as you can see it is automatically imported which is why I don't see any errors so this is how my website is looking at this point home about we have the links but it looks very ugly so let's make it better by using by by going to this nav bar and let's add a div here so let's add a div here and we'll say programming with Harry what I'm trying to do is I'm going to create a logo and then I'm going to create a navigation bar at the right of the logo okay so how do we fix it we can use Shard CN UI actually and we also want to make the snap bar sticky so we can use Shard CN UI for the buttons that I'm going to add but in order to make it sticky I'm give it I'm going to give it some height and let's say h16 and let's say BG red and you'll say why BG red Harry this looks really ugly wait a minute I just want to see how it looks and then I'm going to change the color of this to something else okay so do not worry at all I'm going to add some Bott so first let me make it sticky and then top zero this will actually help me get it at the top when I scroll it really helps when you want your NV bars to stick to the top and then border B border B will add this CSS which is border bottom width one pixel it will add a very good looking border and then let's say BG background now what is BG background and let's say 60 now BG background 60 will actually give it an opacity of 0.6 and it will add minus minus background color as background now what is this minus minus background color we got it from chat c and if you look at global. CSS you'll see that this background is this color this hsl so if you want to convert it to RGB or rgba you can do that you can go to Google and learn about hsl uh it's called Hue saturation and L is for lightness if I'm not wrong yes L is for lightness please confirm this in the comment guys it it is for lightness I guess yeah let's come back to a navb bar. TSX and let's start start building on Navar so we have this border B and we have added a BG background 60 which gives it a very good look I want px8 so that it has padding uh in X and then backdrop blur backdrop blur let's add backdrop blur backdrop blur will simply add this blur effect which really looks cool so if I show you my now it looks something like this but again in the dark mode this is going to look really good and if there is some content behind it this backdrop blur really looks good in order to demonstrate this I want to open the page do DSX and let me add some text I think I've added a lot of text I should not be creating such huge files but if you look at this this is creating a blur effect as you can see this looks like a glass and it really looks good so let me remove this I've created a huge file I shouldn't have done that 435 and I think this should give me enough No it didn't 4350 should give me enough scroll yes yeah okay so we have this website we are going to change the content of this website do not worry let me finish the Navar first so let me come back to Navar and I want this programming with Harry to look bold so class name is equal to font bold and then text Excel I want it to look little larger and then we want to give display Flex to a navbar as well so let's give it a display flex and after giving it display Flex it looks something like this and let me inspect this and let me see how it looks at this point so we have this SV bar the width of this SV bar is full then we have this div then we have this UL let me give Flex boox to this UL also so if I say class name is equal to flex and if I say width full width full and let me also add a color to this so we have this UL taking this much of space and then we have this div taking some space now if I add justify content space around a space between it doesn't work because I should be using align items okay so I should say align item Center let me align these items to Center so align item Center item Center and then we are going to add justify between to this one because I want this to go away from this now since I want this home to be at the end so let me justify this to end justify n should work well here and yeah it does so we have this nav bar and also I want some space so I'll say Space X space x 4 maybe and the space X4 will give the space between all these okay this looks fine this looks fine let me also add a button so I'll say lii do buttons and I'm going to add buttons from shat CN now how do we add buttons from shat CN you might ask you can go to Shar CN UI go to button and copy this this code because you want to add a button so pnpm since we are using pnpm you can use npm as well I don't have any problem but pnpm is going to be much faster than npm so please use pnpm all you need to add is this extra p and npm I minus G pnpm obviously let's copy this button and let's use this button so I'll simply go back to my page. navb bar. TSX and let me add a button here so in order to add a button you have two options one is you can either add this as a button or you can also add as a link like this so if you want to add it as a link like this all you need to do is this and let's import button variants and also let's import I'll go to Quick Fix Quick Fix Quick Fix okay so it says HF is missing so HF is equal to slash login so let us say we have a login page and we have a signup page login and then we have let us say a sign up page sign up sign up okay we have two buttons here let's see how our website looks now it looks something like this so these buttons are not aligned so we need to align this vertically so in order to align this vertically we'll say item Center item Center so item Center will align it vertically and let's add some space so to this Li I'm going to add space x 4 maybe let's see how it looks it's up to you it's up to you you can you can either add space X2 two or you can add space X4 until unless it looks good and I might also add space X6 here and it looks something like this so it's your choice if you want some padding you can add the padding as well so if you want the padding if you say PX 5 maybe PX 4 4 maybe PX4 will work and space X2 I'll have to add some space X2 also and yeah it looks fine I think it looks fine now I also want to be able to add a button to toggle dark mode or light mode now in shat CN you can actually use dark mode and light mode they have the entire page dedicated to this so if you go to nextjs if you click on dark mode here and if you go to nextjs and if you create a theme provider so first you need to install this package called Next themes let's take this step by step we are going to add Dark theme and light theme now so let's take this step by step I've added this next teams package it is installing it has installed now I'll create a theme provider. TSX file and paste this inside of this okay so theme provider. TSX let's create this theme provider. TSX let me go to components and let me say theme providers. DSX and let's paste the content as is and you don't have to understand how it works I'm going to explain how it works but for now you don't have to let's get this working first and then inside a layout. TSX you need to copy this layout. TSX where is my layout. TSX it's here okay I'm going to copy this and components theme provider theme provider is declared but its value is never read okay we are going to use it so we want our body to get access to the theme provider so let's copy this and do do not worry I'm going to explain you everything I am going to explain you everything a navbar should have access to theme provider control X so whatever you wrap inside this theme provider will have access to the default theme so default theme Here is system if you make it dark it will be dark mode okay so if I make it dark my website will go on dark mode now it's giving me some errors which I'm eventually going to solve but let me see what the error is it says fail to compile module not found theme provider let's check what the issue is so it says that cannot find module theme provider or its theme provider okay so I actually named it as theme providers I should call it theme provider it should work now should work now so it is still showing me red line and I'll show you how to fix it so if you uh go to control shift V if you open your command pallet and you type restart Tye TS server and if you restart your TS server this error will go sometimes your error doesn't go away so if you want it to go away and if you are sure that you have done everything right and still you are seeing that red line you can always right click go to command pallet and search for restart type TS server and simply run it and it will work so let's refresh and it's still not working it says that you forgot to add Min CSS extract plugin and I think I need to restart my app let me restart my app this happens sometimes so let's restart the app and after I restart the app I hope it works it's compiling and yes it works and you can see that we have dark mode and it's looking really good and if you don't like this glass glass effect you can always tweak this opacity variable which is 60 at this point if you want to make it 40 if you want to play around with this variable you can do that so 40 40 also looks good so let's keep it 40 or maybe in between 40 and 60 let me keep it 50 but it's up to you it's up to you now I want the ability to change this theme to light or dark at this moment I can do this manually by going to layout. TSX I can do this manually by changing this default theme to light okay now if I change this to light and if I refresh it should have changed to light but not sure why it is not light control shift R doesn't work default theme light let's restart maybe restarting will work restarting and reloading the page makes it light but I want the ability to make it light and dark by clicking this button so let's import these two buttons first and then we'll see how we can toggle the themes but let's go to this page and this page has this this button and if you switch to dark or light you can always change to light and dark let's copy this button as is I really like this so let's import these buttons first and then also import use theme and I'll also have to make my component a client component which is Navar so let me make the Navar as client component because I'm not anyway doing any server side stuff so let's make this component as client component use client let's import the icons and then it says that you have not use it we will use it don't worry let's import this button I think we have already imported the button let's let's copy this and let's copy the mode toggle also and I think if I do this this should but I think a better approach would be to copy this and create a separate component out of it so let's do that instead of making this a client component let me create a separate component called theme toggle theme toggle. TSX and I don't want to repeat the mistake and let's paste this so I have actually copied this and after copying this I've pasted this and I think I have not installed the dropdown so we'll have to install the drop down let's go to drop down and let's install it so as you know that you have to install all of these components one by one step by step so we have not done that so let's copy the pnpm code to install the drop down and let's install it and let's wait for this drop down to install I think it has finished installing and all the errors should go now let's restart typescript server restart typescript server server it works but I think we don't have this module installed we'll have to use this react icons installed so let's copy this and let's do PN PMI PN PMI redx UI react icons and yeah it has been installed so let's restart the TS server to quickly get rid of this red line okay let's get back to our app and it looks something like this we still don't see any button because we have not added it so let's import the mode toggle import mode toggle import mode toggle from theme toggle and let's see what else we can do we can add this mod toggle here mod toggle and let's see how it looks okay so it has not come up yet it has not come up yet let's restart the app okay so it's compiling and yeah it's here it's here so if I click on this one it doesn't work for some reason and I'm not sure why it doesn't work is there anything I've not done correct let me check I'm seeing some eror extra attributes from the server HTML rout layout react boundary oh but the good part is that this button now works so let's see if we can switch the theme we can switch the theme but the thing is that we are seeing this error so let me Google this error very quickly okay so what causes this error okay so if I have some extensions installed then those extensions are causing this error probably if I open a guest window I think this this error should go so if I open a guest window this error should not be present and I think I should not worry about this but it's it's it's still present I'm not sure why so let's see why this error is coming what causes the next year warning disable the grammarly extension solve the problem so since this is only the warning we are going to ignore it for now and we'll fix it later but at this point this works the only thing is that this is not centered so I should Center this so how do I Center this mode toggle I can place it inside of an Li I can place it inside of an Li and I think this should Center it and if I refresh the page it is centered and it looks good also it has some spacing as well which I really like now if you like it as is you can keep it as is but I really want it to be clickable and the moment I click it I should be able to switch between the buttons and it should toggle the light mode and dark mode but if you want to keep it as is you can do that you can always change it to change the icon on click okay but I'm going to focus on this functionality later so let's go to inspect and let's see how it looks on mobile it doesn't look good and we'll have to fix it so how do we fix it we are going to install shart CN component which shart CN component I'll show you but before that I want to be able to hide this hide this Li okay so let's hide this Li the moment we have this let's move this mode toggle outside of UL because I want to hide the UL entirely on phones okay so I'll say hidden and MD Flex hidden and MD Flex MD should be Flex so let's add it here hidden MD flex and let's remove this hidden from here now the moment I switch to a phone this looks something like this and I want this to be towards the right so how do I align it to the right I'll have to figure out so we have this now we have this div and then we have this button so inside the this div we have a ul and a button okay and inside this now we have a ul and a button so we'll have to change the justify part of this so we'll say justify content and not Center I think it's called space between space between yeah space between so justify content will be St space between so justify between justify between okay and let's see if it spoils it yeah it will spoil it for sure so let's fix it by saying justify and at MD but justify between a wise okay so the moment I switch it it is going to work like this but again I'm not sure why it's not working so I want it to justify between so it doesn't have justify between why let me check if I've done any mistake yes I have done a mistake and the mistake is that this justify between should be added here and I think I should be able to fix it now so if I change it it works it just works okay all right so we have this programming with Harry and we have this Moon icon here I want to add a hamburger icon here so I'll go to react icons and react icons redx UI react icons where is my navb bar where is theme toggle so from redx UI react icons I'll import redex UI react icons I will be importing hamburger so let's search for hamburger menu okay so SVG is copied but I don't want to copy the SVG I actually want to use it from the package itself so let's see where I can search for icons so let's go to navbar and let's try to import hamburger menu icon yes I like it I like it okay so let's try to add a hamburger icon and let's see if it's visible and I want this to be visible and from MD it should be hidden and let's see if this works so if I refresh the page I should see the hamburger icon which I'm not seeing for some reason let me see what's wrong here I have added the hamburger icon but it's not visible but why okay so MD is hidden but if I let me remove this MD hidden from here first of all and let's see if we get to see the icon yes we get to see the icon we get to see the icon but we get to see the icon but it is not visible after a certain point so I I'll have to add this somewhere here I think I think I should add it somewhere here yeah it works but again it doesn't look good at this point because again we'll have to maybe add a div here and we'll have to give it a flex class flex and GAP two maybe and then we'll also have to uh items Center because it is not vertically centered and yeah you can always increase the size of this icon so you can have class and you can have size 4 let me check if size four is good enough size 8 size 10 let's go for size 10 it's too it's too too big size 8 size six size six six is a good size yeah or maybe seven is a good size let's see if seven is available yeah it is available and yeah seven is a good size and the moment you click here this should open the menu so let's do one thing let's go to shat CN UI and let's go to I think it's called menu if I'm not wrong menu bar yeah it's actually called sheets it's a weird name but I don't know why this name but it's called sheets let's install sheet pnpm let's run this it will install sheets and let's copy this and let's paste it here paste a sheet here in the nav bar and let's copy this and let's paste this somewhere somewhere after inside the nav maybe yeah somewhere here and then I think all we need to do is Click open and it should work if I'm not wrong so if I click on open it works yeah it works but I don't want to open it when I click open I want to open it when I click on this hamburger icon so let's let's do this yeah it it it works it it looks good so we have this hamburger icon but again this dark theme is not looking good at this point so again a lot of two and pro but yeah we'll have to eventually make the application look good and let's see what is wrong here let's see what is wrong here so we have this justify between here let me remove this justify between justify if I remove justify between let me remove justify between from here and if I remove justify between it looks something like this which is again not looking good so we'll have to keep the justify between let's see what we can do to make it look good so let me do format document and what I've done is I've created a new div after the UL and I've moved this mod to and Sheet inside of this div and this fixes the issue so if I increase this in size it is responsive I'll also have to hide this hamburger icon when um whenever we reach MD so if I say class name I'll have to remove this hamburger icon so we keep keep the mode toggle but we want to hide the hamburger icon so let me say hidden MD uh MD hidden sorry and let's check if this works it should work yeah it is working it is working it should work on phones as well and on an iPhone let me check how it works it it looks fine but I want to change the text size on a phone so how do I do that I'll say MD should be text Excel otherwise it should be text MD okay not muted text MD text MD text LG maybe yeah I think I think we are good we are good I think we should be fine by this and yeah we have created the nav bar we have created this page we can create the login page and also we have this theme toggle working just fine on phones it looks something like this let me swich to iPhone yeah it looks something like this and you can always change this and add your menu here all right so we have done good enough so far all right now that we have come so far we are going to now create blog page so I'll come back to this app folder and inside the blog folder we have page. TSX so we'll write ra fce and I'm going to write blog and let's come back to a Navar so that we can add the blog page to our Navar and let's add it here right after this one so I'll say blog and I also want to create a contact page but let me create the block page first there has to be a contact page on the website right yes so this is the blog page and then we want to display all the blogs and then we have the contact page where somebody can come and contact us so this is the block page this is the contact page let's see if it works so okay so it says field to compile unexpected token now let me check what's wrong here okay I accidentally dragged that happens no worries so this is our blog page so what I'm going to do now is use the max width wrapper let me close all other tabs which are open let's open the blog page. TSX so I'll say hey I need the max width wrapper and inside the max width rapper I want to say H1 and my blogs and after this I want to uh write all the blogs so let's do one thing let's go to chart GPT and I'll say use Tailwind CSN and give me a react component which has all the blogs listed and it should be Style and responsive use map function and chat gbd will do this for you now some of you might say that hey I are using chat gbd why can't you do it yourself I actually can do myself but the only thing is that I don't want to okay I don't want to I don't want to waste my time because I've done it so many times and I don't want to write code to just style a block page so let's wait for chat gbt all right it is still generating content okay so let's copy this and it says that you need to pass all the blogs to this okay we'll we'll we'll handle it as you can see it has the blogs and then we have a Blog and index so let's create an interface for blog okay and then let's call this blog and let's say we have a slug and it has to be a string content is a string and then title is a string and let's keep it simple let's keep it simple and then blogs is a list of blog and blog is a Blog and index is a number okay yes now how do we get the blogs we'll have to somehow get the blogs so we'll get the blogs like this const let's ask chat GPT to complete this or maybe let's do it ourselves give me a list of blogs sample blogs and why I'm showing this to you because I want you guys to have a proper understanding of how to use AI to your advantage okay so these are the blogs okay not bad not bad it's actually generating some blogs which I really like I can actually stop the generation and tell it the schema for the blog but that should be fine I'll just wait let's wait for the generation to complete okay so let's copy this and why are we seeing binding element blog implicitly have block types okay let's do this blogs is this and why are we seeing this error let's let's to format document format document and it says that type blog is not assignable so we have a blog list component let's call it blog type and I'll call this blog type as well blogs. map okay so the thing is that this interface is not obing the format this blocks is not obeying the format of the interface we'll have to fix this so instead of using this blogs we'll have to first create an interface and then we'll give this interface to chart gbd and we'll say hey generate the blog such that it OBS the interface okay image URL should be a string then content is a string and then I think that should be fine I don't even want to keep the description is a string okay let's tell chart GPT to generate generate again the fact that Char gbt is so intelligent that it simply generates uh the blog out of this interface is really mind-blowing so you can see that this has started to generate blog and then slug content title and I forgot to mention here that uh content is um marked down so I can also mention this generate again content is marked down okay so we can click Send and it should be able to generate again as you can see here's an updated version of the blog are using the block type interface let it generate wow it is actually generating markdown now I really like the fact that it is generating markdown we we will use it a we will use and we should use AI because it makes you more productive people say that AI will take your jobs but I say AI makes you productive and I I I'm proving it let's wait for the generation to finish and I'll be back all right it has finished generating this let's copy let's copy the code and I'm not going to paste it inside my page. TSX because eventually I'll remove it I'll either fetch the data from the database or from a directory this is just sample blocks so let's do one thing let's go to our config directory and let's have sample-b blogs sample blogs. TSX TS okay and I'll say export default sample blocks okay and let's name it sample blocks sample blocks call sample blocks okay let's import sample blocks so we have imported sample blogs and we'll be using sample blogs sample blocks and then once again blog. image URL we'll have to copy the interface as well so we'll say sample blogs and block type and let's not import block type because anyway I don't want to use this file this is temporary so let's let's copy the block type and I think V should be good I'll remove this image I don't want this image let's remove the image or maybe let's keep this image I'll say image URL I image URL is string and this should work okay so image URL is string what is the error it's not assignable let's have a semicolon here let's remove this props we don't need the props and the issue here is that we'll have to add this here as well so title description and we'll have to add image URL which I'll have to keep optional so let me keep it optional and yes the errors are gone and there is no link so I think we'll generate the link using slug so let's keep it slash block poost SL slug so I'll say SL block post SL Slug and we'll use a template literal and I think that should do okay let's see where we are at this point okay this looks good but not as good as I thought it should look maybe we can make it horizontal but again I think that should be fine we can make it vertical or horizontal that should not be a problem let's add the sample image so I'll say that if there is no image URL there should be some image so I'll say if there is image. URL uh sorry if there is blog. image URL in the blog use that or else use some other image sample blog images let's see if we can get something can we get some blog image can we get some blog image okay we can get some images from Splash okay I think we can get this or maybe this open image in new tab can I use this or let's go to pexels you can actually download images from pexels and use it for free let's use this one yeah this one looks good I'll download it and I'll tell you why because if you download it it's actually very easy to manage the image and as you can see I am pasting this here inside the public folder and let me call it blog img.jpg so let's call it blog img.jpg so I'll say SLU /blog img.jpg and this should load the image yes it loads the image but again we need to fix the background so how do we fix the background I think this has added some background we don't want a background white because we already have a background so the light theme and dark theme should be taken care of let me check let me toggle the light theme yeah it works but again I want this to be whiter because this kind of looks off I don't want text Indigo I don't want any color I don't want any color I think we are good without color and there is text Gray 700 as well we don't need that either and I think yes we are good now so if we switch light mode it looks good dark mode yeah but can we somehow change this to object fit contain but it doesn't look good if I make it contain let me see what else we can do I want this cup of coffee to be visible so I'll make it object object position object position and it's always a good idea to try it out here before you try it out on the um in the IDE using tailb CSS because it really makes it easy for you so if you say object object position top I want to try top yeah it it the cup is visible so I'm so I'm very happy that the cup is visible good so I'll make object position top and it should work so inside the image we'll say object top object position Topia and you should be able to see the CSS if you have tailb CSS intellisense extension installed so if you go to your extensions and you search for Tailwind CSS intellisense install it and you will get all these suggestions this is how the blog looks now you can always change this button but I'm not changing it as of now so we can go to blogs blog post blog sport I need to fix this I think I misspelled it here not there blogpost SL blog. Slug and here we need to catch the slug using Dynamic routes I'll show you how that is done but before that I think I need to get this button fixed it is not looking good and this is kind of giving me OCD so let's use this button instead and the code of this button is really simple you just have to say import button and use it so it's very very simple let's import button I'll say import button from UI button and where is read mode it's here so I'll say AHF is equal to this class name is equal to I think I can use variant and I don't have to memorize everything I can always say uh class name is equal to button variance variance and I think I can it says okay let me see what's wrong what's wrong I have made some mistake button variants I think there is an extra curly bracket yeah let's import button variants and this should look good let's see how it looks and based of that we'll make our decision of changing it I think this looks clean this looks clean but if you want it to look even better you can V you can change it to variant variant can be either of these default or let let's try default let's try default yeah it looks good I think default looks better light theme looks something like this the Dark theme looks something like this I need some space at the top and bottom of our blocks I know it looks good but I I want to make it better by adding M2 and I think this looks clean so these images will be replaced by different sort of images uh from pels maybe so we can download images from pixabay or paxel and the more images we have a better it will look because if you have same image throughout the blog it doesn't look that good so you can always do that this is the default image but if you have image URL assigned in your blog for example if I open this one and if I get the URL of this image and if I paste past it here in the sample block section I think I can always say something like this and it should work let's see if it works yeah it works so the image for Tailwind CSS is different I can actually increase this the height of this image this doesn't look idle so the height of this image is 48 I think we need to we need to fix it we need to even increase it to 64 64 looks even better I think I think we have done a great job uh displaying all the blogs now the next step is to get our Blog Page working so let's get our block page working so if you click on read Moree this says that default export is not a react component so you need to create a react component and you need to change this to block post okay now this should work and it says block post I will wrap it inside of Max width container wrapper and the max width rapper has already been imported automatically let's add something inside this Max with raer this it says it is missing class name it is missing class name so class name is equal to blank I don't know why it is is giving me this and it says that it is also missing some children yeah now it looks clean now as you can see that the SDF is centered and we can add further items to this Max width wrapper so let me show you the items that I want here first thing that I want here is a flex box and inside this Flex box I want to put the title and HTML content so I'll say H1 and I'll say title here and I want to justify between and I'll tell you why and since we already have Max width rapper we don't need Max width and MX Auto and I think we should be good we have a title here and then we'll have Dev inside which we'll set dangerously set in our HTML and we'll set the HTML this is a way to set the HTML content now where do we get the HTML content from is the question so for now I'll create a constant and I'll say HTML content is equal to and I'll say let me say Dev IM HTML and we'll replace this with blog content don't worry let's see how this looks at this point Title Here I Am HTML here I think we have done a mistake so we have Flex box and inside the flex box we have Title Here I think we we don't need a flx boox that should be fine let's directly add a title here and yeah this looks good title here and then I want to put the HTML here so we can get inspired from different blog templates as well you can look it up online but at this point I want to keep things really very simple so I'll add some classes to this H one I'll say class name is equal to text LG and then font bold and I think that should do or maybe I I should increase the font size to excel let's see how it looks let's do format document uh sorry not format document I want to reset it maybe the font size is not large enough so let's make it 2 XEL but it depends it depends so this is going to be the title of your blog and then here we'll have a content of the blog you can even have image but uh I think I'll skip the image part at this point and I'll focus on the HTML content part so HTML content will be the content of the blog now let's see how we can get the slug from uh this URL so we have slug here so I want you guys to go to nextjs docs and search for dynamic uh routes okay Dynamic routes from the app router not Pages rout router so if you go to Dynamic routes and if you go to this this thing if you copy the typescript code you can copy this typescript code as is and you should be able to get the slug so inside the perms you should get slug so let us replace this export default function page and I want to make it block page params then peram slug and we can destructure slug as well from the perams and you should get the slug so if you if you say uh perams and then perams has a slug or we can simply do perams do slug okay yeah this should be good PM start Slug and if you come back to this URL and refresh it says can only set one of children or dangerously set in our HTML okay so I made a mistake here I want to I want to remove this uh from the children and I should keep this perm. slug separate and this will work now so as you can see that we have Master running react components here and I want to fetch the content through this slug you can set up a database you can either use a CMS but I'll tell you a very straightforward way of using this luck to fetch data and storing your data and that is the file system one of the very straightforward ways of storing your blog is a Content Direct so you can create a new file by double clicking uh in the empty area here so if I double click here I can actually create a file I'll say content /h. MD this is a markdown file which I'm going to pass using some npm packages and I'll show you which packages we are going to use so in order to pass this markdown I'm going to use a package called gray matter so gray matter is a package that we are going to use so let's look into gray matter I'm going to close all these unnecessary tabs and search for gray matter gray matter is an npm package which is used to extract the title slug written in this manner out of this markdown file okay so let us say you have a markdown file written in this format okay so let let me generate a markdown file using chart gbd I'll say generate a markdown file in this format uh slug content title description title description content content here and description here I think we have 1 2 3 4 yeah it's analyzing it I think I should I I should ask it to insert mark down here and let's put this as JavaScript tutorial youate a mark code file in this format for JS tutorial okay let's click Send and it's analyzing so let's wait for it to analyze and it should be able to generate the markdown and by the time it is generating the markdown let me tell you about reh hype remark and unified so reh hype remark unified and I'll tell you what all these things are so unified unified is an npm package let me show you it's an interface to process content with syntax trees so if you're using re hype or Remar you'll have to use unified so you have to use unified in order to use Remar and reh hype now I'll tell you what is Remar and reh hype remark uh as you can see Mark is for markdown and hype is for hyper text markup language which is HTML we use reh hype to transform HTML and we use remark to transform mark down so if we have something written in markdown format and I'm not sure why it gave me the file oh wow it has actually generated a file wow this looks good actually let's copy this code and let me see what it has generated so if I open this it has actually generated this wow I I like it so we have we have this JS tutorial we have Slug and let's rename this let's rename this to JS tutorial js- tutorial and comprehensive guid of learning JavaScript so we'll render this using Remar reh hype unified and gray matter so gray matter is used to extract this content out of this file and remark and reh hype are us used to convert this to proper HTML okay so let's install all these so we are going to install reh hype we are going to install Remar and we are going to install unified now there are tons of plugin for Remar there are tons of plugins for reh hype the fact that remark is used to transform markdown and reh hype is used to transform HTML Remains the Same okay so as you can see we have remark pars which is used to pars markdown we have remark reh hype which is used to convert markdown and then also let me copy this this entire workflow and we are going to use this workflow as is so somebody has build a workflow we are going to use this workflow as is let's use this workflow uh let's copy this and let's paste it somewhere here page. TSX inside the blog no we need the page. TSX inside this blog post let's paste it here and let's also install all these packages so I'll use AI I'll use Ai and I'll ask chat GPD to generate a command generate a pnpm command to install these okay let's wait for this command to finish let's copy this let's paste this and yes we have successfully installed all these so we'll go to command pet we'll restart types script server and all the errors are gone and now we are going to use this function to actually convert the raw content to proper HTML formatted content so let's copy this and let me also put the URL of this blog here now you can always create your own workflow but I'm using this blog because somebody has already created a workflow where they're using tons of plugins and they've also written why they're using these plugins okay now if you don't want to use this thing I mean I have copied this directly from this blog but if you want to start from scratch if you want to start from Clean Slate you can go to UniFi JS npm page and you can copy this one I would strongly suggest that you copy this one instead of the one that I recommended and there is uh a package called rehy document and rehy format as well so you can use the rehy document and rehy format as well but let me remove this and we'll see what happens if we don't use these two packages there is something called rehy highlight also but again if we need anything we'll install the plugin for the same okay so we have this uh dot process which takes the markdown as the argument okay but now since I have this remark Parts front matter I I'm already using uh the gray matter package I don't want to use this so what I'll do is I will import matter from Gray matter import matter from Gray matter from from Gray matter gray matter I hope I'm doing things right I think I haven't yet installed gray matter so I'll have to do PN PM I gray matter uh oops I need to type gray matter and the moment I do that it should install gray matter and I should be able to import matter now if I say result is equal to await uh in fact I don't even have to use await I can say result is equal to unified and then I'll use all these plugins and then I'll say dot process and this needs a weit the dot process needs a weit so what we'll do is we'll remove this process part and I'll show you what we'll do we'll actually read this directory so the directory is called content okay so let's do one thing uh let's say const file path is equal to and let's use string literal and I'll say content slash I'll use dollar I'll say perams do Slug and I'll say MD Now what is perams do slug I'll have to take it uh I'll have to take it from here and this thing needs to be inside my component so let me move this thing inside my component okay I think I forgot to copy this contr x contrl v and yes so we have got perams do slug so we are basically reading this file now what I'll do is I'll say con and I'll say file content is equal to I'll use the fs package FS is a package for import FS from FS if I'm not wrong yes import FS from fs and this will import the file system package uh now what I'll do is I'll read the directory I'll say file content is equal to uh firstly I'll read the file I'll say fs. read file sync and read file sync will help me read the file file path utf8 now you don't have to remember this if you want you can go and Google and copy the code from there but I um happen to remember all this because I do it very frequently but again if you don't then you can just go and copy from the internet now I'll use matter now cons data content I also happen to remember this but you don't have to remember and I'll have to ensure that it is correct yeah so when you say matter file content I'll show you where this is coming from so if you go to the gray matter package homepage you'll see that you can use it by importing matter from gr matter and then if you do matter it gives you content and data inside of an object so what I'm doing is I'm pulling out the content and the data which has a title so I'm saying data content is equal to matter file content so I'll get data and I'll get content okay now that I have content I can create HTML content on my own so I don't have to do this I can say HTML content is equal to and I'll say await process wait I'll have to store this thing in a variable called process so processor let me say processor is equal to this and then I'll say processor do process you can even name it title or whatever you want okay processor processor what am I doing processor okay processor do process and after I do that I'll say content and then after I have awaited this so I'll await this and then I'll say do two string do two string and which is why I'm using these parenthesis okay because I want to aoid this first and then I want to convert it to two string I'll have to make this function async so let's make this function async I hope my screen is visible hopefully my screen is very clearly visible yes it is okay so we have data we have content and now we have also used this processor which is giving us HTML content and now let's do this let's print the HTML content on the page and let's see how it works so let me refresh this page so we have block post mastering react components and I'm not sure why it's not working I think I'm not running the dev server pnpm run Dev and yeah it should work now let's wait for the server to start and once the server is started we should be able to see the blog rendering okay so we have got some problem here it says no such file or directory it's saying there is no file or directory called content let me check if there is a fileo directory called content I have made this content directory not sure what the problem is c n t n t I've said file path is equal to content perm. slug DMD it should work but I'm not sure why it's not working it says that you don't have a Content directory which is very weird inside the awesome PW blog I do have this content directory I think I don't have this file yeah I don't have this file so I'll have to say JS tutorial and and then we'll also make sure that we are throwing the 4 not4 error if this file doesn't exist so JS tutorial and yeah it works but the problem is that this title and this content is not rendered correctly so it is not looking good yeah it's not looking good for sure and we are getting all of this uh title Slug it doesn't look good at all and then we have this content no doesn't look good at all so we'll have to fix it so when I say Title Here I need to get the title from the data so I'll say data. title and at the same time I want to make sure that after I get the title I am also parsing the content correctly so let me go to the gray matter package yeah data. title is good and then I I'll have to say uh HTML content is equal to this and it seems that the content is also an object I have to see what I'm doing here so we have all of these title Slug and content rendering so we'll have to check what the problem is okay now I see where the error is coming from we have an extra space here which should not be there and as you can see that this markdown is highlighting this front matter so if I come back to this file and if I remove this perm. Slug and I have added data. title here and then we have this uh dangerously set in HTML here I think this should work and let's see if this is rendering yes it's rendering just fine but the problem is that Tailwind CSS is not styled by default how do we solve for this problem there is a very easy solution to this problem and the solution is Tailwind typography so if you have never heard of Tailwind typography let me tell you what it is so Tailwind uh HTML is not styled by default default if you want to style Tailwind by some basic CSS then you will have to uh let me let me show you how it works so if you install this and if you want default Styles then you can use Tailwind typography it is nothing but some default styles that your Tailwind CSS classes will get so the thing is Tailwind CSS will reset styles for H1 H2 div span this will give those default Styles back in fact not the default Styles but better than default Styles I I'll show you so we have just installed Tailwind typography let me come back to this page and choosing a gray scale let's do one thing let's add this to plugins so if I add this to my tail.com dots and I'll search for the plug-in section okay so here is the plugin section and I'll say plugins requir tailin typography and then we'll need the comma as well I hope the Tex is correct yes it is and let's restart the server as well it's always a good idea to restart the server once we have installed a plugin and also it is showing some error so I have already installed gray matter but it still shows the error if you don't know why this error is coming you can simply come to your command pallet and restart the typescript server and should go okay let's see if it is working and if I refresh this page I'm refreshing this page and still we have not got any default style so in order to get those default Styles you'll have to add a class and the name of that class is Pros p r o s e so if I add class name is equal to pros and then for dark I want to add Pros invert pr- invert you'll see that it is styled by default how cool it it is looking can you see yeah it's looking amazing I I love how it looks and then we already have the title so we'll have to remove the title from our markdown we don't want this title because we already have the title okay so as you can see that we already have the title we have removed the title from here and JavaScript tutorial table of content we'll have to do one thing and the thing is we will have to remove the styles from our H1 so instead of saying text to excel we'll simply say H1 and this should work and we'll also update the page title you can do that okay you can update the page title as well well all right nice this looks pretty good what's next so next thing that we'll do is we'll create an on this page component now what is this on this page component let's create a let's create a component inside our components folder and let's name this component as on this page on this on this page do TSX rafc and this component will simply help us get this on this page on our page okay awesome so what we'll do is we'll create this as a client component first of all so we'll say use client and then we'll also import use effect and use State use State because we are going to use State and also we'll get HTML string as props so we'll say HTML content and then we'll give it an interface HTML content is string so that we can get rid of the typescript error now we'll use use State snippet and we'll say that we'll have a state called links so we have links set links is equal to use State okay and I think we can simply say use State now I'll also create a new interface for links so I'll say interface link and then I'll say link type let me call this interface as link type and I'll say ID can be string and then text can be string and the type of this use uh this links can be null or we can have link type link type the array of Link type I hope this works and then we'll see null so what this is basically saying is that the type of let me give it a type and then we'll say null so I'm saying this links can either be null or an array of Link type okay and then we are initializing it with null okay I hope this is clear and then we are going to use use effect use effect snippet and we are going to use this use effect like this okay so it will run only on first render and then we'll say con temp is equal to document do create element so I'll create a raw element and I'll name it as div and then I'll say temp do inner HTML inner HTML is equal to and I'll say HTML content and what is this HTML content we are getting this HTML content from here so if I use this on this page component I'll use it such that I'm giving it HTML content okay is equal to HTML content and we have this HTML content on this component okay so far so good so far everything is clear yes it is now we'll create headings so what I'll do is I'll extract out headings from this Temp and I'll say I I want to use Query selector all and I want to get all the H2S and h3s I don't want to get H1 because there is only one H1 I want to get H2S and h3s and if you want to get h4s also that should also be fine and I think I'm making some mistake H2 comma H3 I think this should work and if it doesn't work we'll change this okay so let me Mark this because I'm not sure if this will work or not this should work okay but we'll get back to it if it doesn't work then we'll say generated links which is of type link type array link type array now generated links is equal to blank okay generated link is blank and now we'll say headings dot for each see what I'm doing here I'll say heading index and then an arrow function and then I'll say const ID is equal to heading. ID or it can be heading. ID if heading. ID is not present we'll have to give it some ID we'll give it ID on our own heading Dash dollar and we can use index okay it's a dirty way of giving ID to an element which doesn't have an ID but again I'll say heading Dash dollar Index then I'll say heading. ID is equal to ID and then we are basically ensuring that each link has an ID here okay now what we'll do is I'll say generated link dot push push generated links. push and I want to push ID and I want to push text and I'll say heading do inext okay heading do inner text and V okay so I made some mistake here I'll say ID heading do iner text and I'm getting some errors here I'll see what the problem is so I want to push ID and text okay ID and text text should be heading heading do inner text okay now it says that cannot find name heading do you mean headings heading. for each okay so this should be inside of this so we have this for each and everything should be inside for each so generated links. push ID and then text so the problem that we are facing here is a typescript error so basically what happens is that uh heading is of type string uh heading is of type string uh it's of type element okay it's of type element and element doesn't have inner text so let's do one thing let's say heading as heading as HTML element and this should fix the error yes it fixes the error and now we are going to say set links after this for Loop has finished and I'll say set links HTML sorry generated links generated links and then I want to make sure that whenever HTML content changes HTML content whenever it changes this use effect should run again okay and then what we'll do is we'll simply return this on this page component so we'll have to write some CSS now so we have a div and we'll say class name is equal to and we don't want it on phones so I'll say hidden and then whenever we get to MD I'll say blog and then um I'll see I I'll see how we can style it let's make it sticky let's make it sticky and we'll give it some padding as well but let's give it a heading at this point on this page we can style it for sure and let's say ul and let's say links and links. map now what is links links is basically the the the state that we have created okay so we'll say links and Link do map we want to display all the links here and say link and let's let's use Li lii and uh we'll have to use a key as well because otherwise it will throw an error so I'll say key is equal to and I'll say link. ID because now all the links have an ID we have already given links and ID and then we can say a HF is equal to a HF is equal Al to and let's use JavaScript here because I want to use template literal and then we'll say hash and then we'll say link. ID I hope this works I hope this will work and then I'll add link. text link. text and I'm not sure why we are getting this error so we are saying links and links. map and we are giving it link and then we are saying lii lii key is equal to this there has to be some issue here uh is not assignable to type react node okay so we'll have to return this return and yeah it works we'll have to return this so now what happens is we are getting all the links and it should be displayed somewhere but it is not displaying it anywhere not sure why this happens but again this should should have been displayed somewhere so we have class name is equal to hidden air then MD blog class is equal to Sticky uh maybe we are um let let let me deice this page first and we should be able to see something okay so we have this on this page here and I want this on this page to go from here to somewhere here okay let's see if this works so if I click on functions we are not getting anything headings three this is headings 2 this is headings one uh table of content intro to JavaScript okay so it doesn't go anywhere the thing is that it doesn't work and for this we'll have to use a reh hype uh headings there is a plugin for reh hype autolink headings okay so this is called reh hype autol link headings what this basically does is this will link all the headings that is present in your page okay all right so let's install this so we'll say pnpm install pnpm install this so let's say pnpm install rehive boto link headings and the moment I install this it has been installed and we'll have to use it as a plugin how do we use it all we need to do is say do use rehy autol Link headings and it should work and we'll say dot use Rey AO link headings and we'll import this so we'll hover over it and we'll say add the import it will add the input and now let's check if this is working or not so is it working let's check check the documentation page okay so they are using reh hype slug as well I think we'll have to use reh hype slug as well for this to work and let's import reh hype Slug and we have we haven't yet install reh hype slug so we'll have to install it once again pnpm installed reh hype Slug and this will install reh hype slug yes it did and let's come back to a page and see if this work Works let's see if this works it doesn't work I think we have not used it so we'll have to use it do use reh hype Slug and yeah this should work now okay so the thing is that this on this page is working now as you can see so if I click on asynchronous JavaScript it is scrolling but it's scrolling such that the heading is being covered by this nav bar so we'll have to fix this and how do we fix it we'll simply add a scroll padding okay so let's let's see how we can do it uh scroll padding yeah it's called scroll padding if I'm not wrong I'll have to go to my uh page app folder and inside app I'll go to layout. TSX and inside HTML I'll add a class name and I'll say scroll padding scroll padding 14 let's see if this works if I refresh this and if I go to control structures yeah I have to give little bit more scroll padding little bit more so so let's do 19 if it it's there it's 16 is there let's see if 21 is there I'm pressing control space bar when I don't get any suggestions because if you press control space bar it triggers the drop down Okay so let's see if this works now if I refresh okay so I'm refreshing and I'm clicking objects and array it doesn't work okay so not PX scroll padding scroll P20 let's see if this works now functions yeah it works now now another thing that I can add is scroll smooth yeah scroll smooth is the class and it adds scroll Behavior smooth now what will happen is the moment you click here it will automatically scroll you like this which looks very good it looks very pretty nice nice and good so the thing is now that I want to divide this part into two separate columns such that this covers say 1/3 and this on this page should cover 2/3 so I'll have to come back to my page. TSX I'll have to give correct position to this on this page component okay how do we do that let's see how we can do that firstly I'll remove this Max okay let's not remove this Max with rapper let's put a Dev and I'll say class is equal to flex class is equal to flex and then we have this heading and then we have this so we'll wrap the heading and this div into one div so we have this div and this on this page inside a flex box let's refresh and see if on this page is coming here yes it is coming here but the problem is I want to make it little smaller and I want to give some padding towards left and right so let's see we can do that I think in order to make this function I'll have to give some padding to my initial div so let's say class name is equal to px6 and let's see if this maintains some space yes it does and also I want to decrease the font size of this on this page and how can I do that I can always do that by by simply giving it a class name so I'll say class name is equal to class name is equal to and let's give it uh text uh SM and I'll have to add class name to this component so I'll say HTML content class name and class name should be a string class name is a string and class name should be given to this St so I'll use CN I'll say CN let me say CR X and then I'll say CN CN is imported and then I'll paste this and class name so whatever class I give here will be overridden inside this St okay let's wait and let's see if this is the the the size of this has reduced or not yes it has and I want to get rid of Tailwind typography let me check how do we get rid of Tailwind typography so if you want some components of your page to not use tailin typography you can use not Pros class so if I add a not Pros class here not Pros it should remove the pros class from here as you can see all the uh Pros classes have been removed but I don't have to essentially remove Pros classes from here I can also do this from here so I can say remove it from this UL so let's say class name is equal to a remove not Pros not pros and let's see how it looks it looks just fine I think it looks pretty good table of content uh I want to add some padding top pt4 maybe let's see how pt4 is too much I think pt1 should be good yeah pt1 is good enough variables and data types on this page we have this this this this this it looks good it looks pretty good okay so now we have to solve for a lot of problems the first problem is that if we scroll uh this is happening and we don't want this to happen so if I show you this on this page component we have added a class sticky I want to add a top six to this such that it has some padding top but I think I'll have to add top 16 and yeah top 16 looks good but I think uh it's a good idea to increase this number as well yeah yeah this is this is fine this looks fine and also I want to make sure that the width of this this particular box is good enough so if I say width so we have this div and we have another on this page if I give it a width of 2x3 let me see if width of 2x3 works I think 2x3 is too much uh let's see if I can give it width of 2x 6 uh yeah 2X 6 looks fine but I think I can do better 2x 6 is 1x3 uh I think I think I'll have to try something else 5x 6 no I think 1X 2 will be too much 5x 6 uh if I give it a width of 20% if I give it a width of 20% yeah it looks pretty good now it looks pretty good so you'll have to experiment if you are creating your own design uh you you should you should be able to change the classes and you should be able to try out different things and something will work something will make it look good now the reh hype prettyy reh hype uh it's called reh hype prettyy if I'm not wrong pretty code it it's called rehy pretty code let's install this magical extension this rehy plug-in uh rehive pretty code installation is here and I want to install it using pnpm and yeah the good part is coming I love this extension and it's installing Shiki as well so let's install both the things and let's let's see how we can use it so all you need to do is you need to add this do re use rehy code and you can give theme as well so I'll show you how to give theme because I love using themes uh all you need to do is pass it an option to add the GitHub theme or any theme so let's first use it so I'll import it first and then I'll use it so I'll say import rehy code rehy code it's not giving me the suggestion to import it but I think I should be able to import it uh is it installed yes it is installed but I'm not able to import it re hype pretty code from so let me do IMD read re Hy code rehy code okay this should work okay so I have imported rehy code from rehy prity code and I'll say do use Rey prity code and you can also use options so you can say comma and you can give an object and we can apply a theme here so I'll say theme can be uh material material theme darker material theme ocean let's go to material theme ocean and let's see if this works yeah it works it looks pretty damn cool can you see it highlights my syntax like anything I love this and this makes my blog look very professional let's see if this is responsive because I've not checked for responsiveness in a while so let's let's see if this is responsive this is responsive it seems yeah it is responsive uh but the problem is for or MD this on this page looks a little weird so let me see if I can convert this to 100 person and also let's see if this dark theme is working yeah Dark theme is also working wow it looks so good it looks so good nice nice we'll fix this we'll fix this but let's see if the headings are working yeah headings are also working so I'll do one thing I'll add some more blogs and I think that should be able to make it look look even better but again this is looking pretty clean pretty good and we'll uh now add the copy button and after that we'll move to other stuff so in order to add the copy button you simply have to go to this copy button part and I think all you need to do is copy this part of the code uh copy button yeah and add Transformers as the option so inside the options where is my rehy code rehy code yeah it's there so inside the options you need to add the Transformers like this oops something is wrong yeah something is wrong let me check what is wrong let me do contrl zed contrl zed okay so this is the options and inside the options I'll have to use Transformers yeah Transformer copy button okay so let's import Transformer copy button we'll have to install it I guess how do we import Transformer copy button okay so you'll have to install this rehy Transformers let's install this pnpm install re hy/ Transformers and yes we'll import it now Quick Fix add missing NOP not like this let's import it so we'll say import uh Transformer copy button let me copy paste it from here I should not bother to type it and guess it again and again let's paste it and let's see if it works let's hope for it to work now yeah it works let's see if it is copying the code or not yeah it's copying the code amazing amazing so crln and yeah it's copying the code I love it copy crl V to paste and now I'll show you how we can add some more blogs so all all you need to do now is you can simply go to your content and add more markdown so I'll say uh generate generate markdown content or files for my blog in this format so I'll give it the format this is the format and I'll say Hey you have to let me remove this content thing you have to Simply generate some content for me in this format and I'll say are you ready are you ready it will say yes I'm ready give me the titles generate for ultimate Python tutorial let's see if it gets it correct oh yeah it does let's wait for the generation and you know it it really generates it very well and sometimes it's so useful that I I read my own AI generated blogs yeah because it is trained on the data of all the blogs on the internet and it knows the GPT 4 model knows what is best and it gives pretty damn amazing content let's wait for it and then I'll be back I'm waiting for its generation let's see if we can create the file in the meantime so this will be your file name let me create the file in the meantime do MD and then I'll also go to this file as you can see that this file is empty at this point and we just see on this page we'll fix this as well it should throw a 4 not4 error which is which it's not throwing at this point but let's copy the content let's copy the content and let's let's paste it here and now it should be be able to load it why are we seeing the title twice because we have it in the markdown as well we don't want to see the title in the markdown all right so it should work now on this page introduction to python setting up uh setting up the python environment okay so this on this page looks little off we have we'll have to fix this this looks a little off you'll have to fix this because this is a big one this is a large huge blog okay let me see how I can fix this so in order to fix this I should fix this display flex and this should take the entire width so why am I giving it width of 20% when I can give it a width of say 50% why am I giving it width of 30% when I can give it width of 50% let me give it width of 50% and let's see if this serves the purpose with 50% and let's see if this serves the purpose it should serve the purpose table of content and then we have introduction to python then we have setting up python we have everything and how about we just take few characters from from the title we can do that as well we can do that as well so let's take only 10 characters from the title we we can do that but let's see how it's going to look let's do link. text. slice and we'll do 0 to 50 and if the length is greater than 50 if we say if link. text. length is greater than 50 then we want to show triple dot otherwise we don't want to show anything and let's see what the problem here is okay so the problem is I have to put a question mark here okay and let's see if it works yeah it does it does so it's a huge block which is why it's showing so many headings but that should be fine and I can also add text XS like this to make it extra smaller so yeah it is extra small now and it looks good also as you can see yeah it looks pretty good so we have provide examples and explanations I don't know why it has not provided the examples and explanations it should actually generate the content for me but that should be fine you can do it on on your own so yeah our blog is looking pretty good at this point I really love how it looks but the challenge now is that we have to populate this page where we want to be able to go to all the blogs so in order to populate this page we'll read the directory content and we'll get all the content here now before I do all this I want to show you something I'll tell chart GPT to write this again with full complete content keep the headings short and uh keep the headings shorts and without numbering okay and let me fix this and I'll show you why I have done this I'll show you an example if you see this chat CN UI example you'll see that they have kept these headings intentionally very short so that people can see this on this page very clearly so they have kept the headings really very small intentionally so that the page renders just fine and as you can see the lab installation usage everything is intentionally made short such that you can see this on the page on this page very clearly so let's do one thing let's do the same thing for our python blog as well and as you can see that this is uh as you can see that this is generating content for me and it has leaked the content out of this box I don't know why it's some chat gbd bug or something but I think I should be able to fix this let it finish first and I'll show you how we can fix it it okay so as you can see that it has generated something let me copy this and let me see if I can copy this to my ultimate Python tutorial so all I need is the markdown okay and it is it's for some reason not working the chat gbt thing is not working for some reason I don't know why but let's let's do this let's do this yeah I think this should be able to pass it yeah so so so it's it's done as you can see the headings are intentionally made small this is a really huge blog with a lot of headings so you can also choose to show only some of the headings uh I can also choose to show only H2S if not all so I'll say don't show h3s just show me H2S it is still very long but again you can do that okay it it is shortened and as you can see error handling we have functions we have Advanced python we have extended libraries and yeah this blog looks pretty clean if you see this in the light mode it looks like this you can also change the theme you can change the theme to GitHub GitHub dark or something I don't remember it's called GitHub dark yeah GitHub dark it looks good as well you can choose your theme it's up to you the copy button Works amazing stuff okay let's make this button work and we are going to Now work on the homepage page so in order to make this button work I'll have to go to Navar and inside the Navar I'll have to add a link so I'll say link and let me say HF is equal to slash and let's do this so this works now and I and we'll work on this page now I'll tell you something and I'll show you something so I'll say uh nextjs dashboard templates and this is something that not a lot of people use but they should be using in my opinion and I'll show you why uh so so there are a lot of themes available online uh let me take this for instance and let me go to this website creative tim.com and I will have to check whether this is written using Tailwind or not and any website which is written using Tailwind CS s you should be able to copy it as is so let me check if it is written using Tailwind CSS uh I think it it has some custom CSS but again if you want to copy some website as is you can do that if it is written using Tailwind I'll show you an example so I'm using this page as demonstration all you need to do is go to inspect and copy this part of the code AS is so I'm copying ing this section I'll say copy element and I'll paste this section inside the main tag okay and obviously I'll have to replace class is equal to by class name is equal to so I'll say uh let me say change all occurrences and I'll say class name is equal to this and required is equal to I'll say true required is equal to true and what else is showing error okay so I have to fix this you can always fix this using AI as well format document but again I'm not using AI at this point I want to manually fix it any more error yeah we have an error for image any further error okay I don't see any further error here yeah it's red still red I can't see the error okay so we have an error on this input tag so input tag needs to be closed like this um any further errors okay so I'll have to very carefully fix this so we have input input input input yeah button type is equal to submit class name is equal to I think I made some mistake I'll have to fix it okay now I can do something like this and it should work okay yeah it should it works now let's see okay so we have successfully copied dark mode light mode everything works and you can always add more below this you can use the same website to copy but again uh you should be able to do it from other websites there is a website for this actually it's called tail blocks. CC and I'll show you how it works you can copy this so you can say view code copy to clipboard and we can add another section section and I should be able to paste this and again class is equal to needs to be replaced with class name is equal to class name is equal to and then it looks like this as you can see so yeah it is looking good and obviously uh this is not perfect but again you'll have to change a lot of things if you want images you can add images as well but I just want to show you how you can build the website Dark theme looks like this I'll change the color of this doesn't look good so in order to make the Dark theme work we will change the uh BG gray 100 so let's copy this let's change all occurrences and we'll add a class and we'll say dark BG graay 900 let's see if this works so instead of BG gray 100 or maybe we can say BG white if not BG gray 900 we'll say BG white and yeah it looks it looks fine it looks fine okay so we can see the light theme looks like this and the Dark theme looks like this you can always change the designs you can play around you can do it on your own okay and we can also change the color of this on dark mode because this kind of doesn't look good in dark mode so you can do all those things you can always go to the search box I'll show you how to do this where is the search box I think I'll have to go to the input comp component input input input input where is where is the input input is not here I think yeah input is here yes it is it's here type is equal to search and I'll have to say whenever whenever the Dark theme is active make bgs black I'll just try this out I'll just try this out so if I say dark mode BG is black and not not not just black let's make it gray 800 8 gray gray 800 yeah it looks good now let's see light mode looks like this dark mode looks like this yeah it looks fine and you can always add your text here it will it will look good okay nice so let's add some Shard CN FAQs now let's add some Shard CN FAQs now and before this section I want to make sure that I add a heading to this section I'll remove this extra section closing tag before this section I'll add a a heading and I'll say uh about our services and you can always add class name of pros and dark Pros invert [Music] invert and about our services looks like this doesn't look good doesn't look good at all so we'll have to move this inside inside the container yeah and Pros doesn't work for some reason Pros doesn't work for some reason I don't know why Pros is not working but Pros is actually giving it a Max F so let's do text 2 Xcel text 2 Xcel and this should work py4 font bold yeah it looks good now and I think text gray 600 is not looking good so let me add text primary here yeah it looks good now and light theme like this and dark theme like this yeah it looks fine and I think I can change it to text 4 XL it will look even better yeah it it looks even better and if I Center it I think it'll look even better so it takes time to make something look good obviously obviously py8 so that we have some more space in fact let's make it pb8 so that we have some padding at the bottom of this padding bottom and mb4 and let's see how it looks on phone it should look good on phone as well so this looks like this on mobile phones yeah it looks good I'm satisfied it looks pretty good and yeah we'll have to change this as well so we'll do that but before that let's see if this is working fine or not so the Z index is not working for this one I think we'll have to fix the Z index and we can fix this by adding Z10 to a navbar so I came to nav bar. TSX and I've added this z-10 here and yes it fixes it it looks really cool it looks really good if I scroll down it looks like this if I go to blog this looks like this if I go to about we have not yet made the about page but it looks good as well you can always work on the about page and then if we go to a blog post it looks something like this so now let's do one thing I'm going to build the about page and also I'm going to build the contact page and then we go after this Blog Page okay so let's build this about page and contact page I'm going to quickly build it using tail CSS and you can then grab a copy of about page as well as contact page from the description destion I'll code it for you and then you can simply grab a copy of it just to save some time because this is not a design course just like we designed the home page I will Design the about and contact page as well now let's Design This Blog Page this is not Dynamic so we'll have to make it Dynamic if I go to blog and page. TSX I should read all these blogs from the directory so let's write code for this so what I want is I want to be able ble to read the content directory such that all these blocks are read and whenever I place a MD file here the MD file should be read okay let's do one thing let's start by writing some code so what I'm going to do now is I'll say const file content is equal to or di content so I'll say cons D content content is is equal to and I'll say fs. readd sync let me import FS first so let's input FS from FS yes this should work and there is a function is an FS called readd sync which synchronously read your directory content and utf8 and you can get this code from either chat GPD or from internet okay and let's see see if I'm able to read the directory content so let's do file content sorry di content and let's see if I'm able to get the DI content here yeah I'm able to get the DI content here so if I refresh this page you'll see the DI content is here which is cool okay so we have this di content here so it runs server side which is amazing now I'll say cons blogs is equal to dir content do map and I am going to take all the files and I'll say file content is equal to read fil sync fs. read fil sync and I'll use content slash and let's use a template Ral file and you know what I'm doing if you know nodejs you know what I'm doing right basically I'm reading the file content I'm reading in the content of the file and I'm extracting data out of this file content and I'll have to import matter so I'll hover over it quick fix add import from Gray matter it automatically does that and let's see what else we need so we'll say return data because we want to assign data to the blog okay so we want to say di content. map and for all the elements in di content I want to extract out data so let me show you how the blog is going to look like so if I say console.log blogs you'll see all the blogs here let me show you so this is how the blogs is going to look like let me scroll down this is how the blogs is going to look like so I have the title I have the slug I have the description but I don't have the content because I don't want the content so let's now go to the page and let's see if this page is rendering using these blogs no it's not rendering using the blogs it's actually rendering using the sample data which we have so I will have to remove all this sample data so instead of saying sample blogs I should say blogs so I'll say blogs do map instead of saying sample data. map let me remove this sample data because I don't need the sample blogs okay so we get this JavaScript tutorial and Python tutorial which is great but I'm getting some issue here and it says that argument of type blog okay so I guess that the type is not matching okay and and the type should match which is why we use typescript right slug is there content is there title is there let me see what is not there so that we can fix it title Slug and description is there content is not there we don't need the content because we actually want to we actually want to just get the metadata we don't want the content so let me remove the content from block type and then description is the image URL is optional and this should should actually remove this error let me return this I think I'm not returning which is why it's throwing the error no this is not the problem I'm already using this parenthesis so it automatically returns it says that argument of type blog is not assignable to parameter of type value so in order to fix this I will have to tell that this blocks is of block type and also it it is of block type array and as you can see that the error is gone but again we have another error which says type is not assignable to block type okay so I see what it's saying so it's complaining about the fact that what whatever we are returning is not of block type so we'll have to uh we'll have to say const data const con data is of type block type okay and then when we are returning the data it should be block type so the data is coming from matter and this is actually array of string if I'm not wrong the data is a string okay so we'll have to type cast it such that the data is a string so we'll say const uh const value which is of block type is equal to and we will have to uh it says is declared but never read we'll fix this value [Music] value and our block type has slug title and description and we don't want image URL so slug title description slug is data do slug title is data. title and description is data. description okay and instead of these semicolons I should be using commas okay yeah I think this should fix it and yeah it it it is fixed so let's refresh the page and we can see that we have all these blogs now we can open these blogs the moment I click on read more I'm directed to this page and all these headings just work now once again if I come to the blog page I can see that I can go to any of these Pages not sure why these are so slow but I think I should be using the link tag which I'm not using I'm using a tag I should be using the link tag from next link so let's use Link tag and I'll have to import the link tag so I'll hover over it quick fix and import link from next link and yeah it should be faster now the moment I click it's loading just as fast as it can and let's also install react top loading bar I'll show you what it is so this react top loading bar basically helps you get a very fancy top loading bar which actually looks good in my opinion it looks very good oops I should be using pnpm and yeah it is it is actually installing let me update my pnpm as well so it says run this to update I will update my pnpm because it is awesome it it works really fast all right so I think we are good let's use the stop loading bar now I'll show you how to use this top loading bar so you just have to import loading bar from Top loading bar and we are going to use it with state so we are going to come to layout. TSX I keep forgetting the file names I don't know why and let's put the loading bar somewhere here I will I have to use state which is why I will be creating a new component but I think I can just put it inside the nav bar yeah I can so let's open the nav bar and we can make a Navar as a client component use client and let's copy this code so we have this stop loading bar and I want to be able to show this bar so let's copy this loading bar so I'll say loading bar and I don't want any fancy loading bar I just want it to just work uh and I'll have to make the states as well so let me copy this and I'll have to import use State as well so we'll have to import P you state from react yeah I think we should be able to see the loading bar but the thing is that if we change the state then only we are going to see the loading bar so format document so the very easiest hack is to use use effect and inside use effect what you do is you just say that after some time this loading bar should should just load okay or you can even use uh next navigation so let us explore next navigation next next navigation and let's open this page next navigation I I I want to use these peram path name sorry not perams I want to use this path name yeah I I'll tell you why I'm doing this but let's import use path name from use uh from next navigation and I'll say con path name is equal to path name is equal to path name is equal to use path name and I should be able to get the path name so this gets me the path name and whenever the page changes the path name changes and when the path name changes I should be able to change the progress so I'll say set progress to 30% first and then change it to 100% And I should be able to change the progress to 100% only after some time say after 100 milliseconds okay and I'll explain why I've done that I think it's very self-explanatory first I want the progress to go from 0 to 30 and then after some time I want it to go from 30 to 100 so that it gives me a feeling that the page is loading through the top loading bar okay cool and also whenever a page loads I should be able to reset the progress to zero so whenever a page loads the progress should be zero and only then when I navigate to some other page I'll get this progress 30 and progress 100 and I think this should work but let's try this out and I'll show you it should work okay so I have this page let's refresh this page so as you can see it went from 30 to 100 and now if I go from this place to blog okay so we are not getting the loading bar I'll have to check why we are not getting the loading bar we should be getting the loading bar by the way we are not getting any loading bar okay so the thing is that whenever this page loads I'm changing the progress to zero and after that I'm changing the progress to 30 and then to 100 okay so I I should be able to do this whenever path name changes so whenever path name changes we'll do this and we'll do this whenever page loads okay now this should work for sure now if I go to homepage we get this loading bar if I go to and I think I can increase this time to suit my preferences so if if I go to blog yeah it looks good and if I change this to say 1,000 milliseconds which is 1 second it will look like this okay and if you want even more steps you can do something like this so you can say that oops I actually made a mistake so I'll say it'll go from 30 to 70 and I should change this I'm so sorry I should change this and not this okay this is the progress this goes from zero 200 don't want to confuse you guys so let's do this so in 100 milliseconds I want it to go from 30 to 70 and then in say 800 milliseconds I want it to go from 70 to 100 okay let's see how this works yeah this is looking better I think this is even better yeah this is looking better I I really like this one yeah this is looking good and then also I want to change this I want to change this from 800 to 900 because only after all this has done I want to reset the progress to zero and I think this should work now so if I go to about yeah this is looking amazing you can see it it looks really good it looks really good it looks like the page is loading which is what we want yeah page is loading smoothly it loads smoothly the only thing is I want to change the color to purple so let's change this color to purple and can I pick the color I think I cannot so how do I pick the color I want to pick the color so let's go to inspect and let me see if I can get a Color Picker somewhere yeah I can get a Color Picker here I want to be able to pick this color so let me use this and let's let's use this color and I want to copy the Hax color hex code of the color oops did I not copy the hex code or what where is the okay so you have to click here and then you have to use this and then once you have this you can copy by clicking here now it is copied and let's paste it and yeah now if I refresh the page just to be sure that it is working let's click on about yeah did you see the top loading bar it's looking fantastic it's looking fantastic now let's go to blog JavaScript tutorial amazing we can copy the code all the types are here we have used Tailwind typography the only thing that we want to do now is change the title so I'll show you how to change the title using metadata so let's search this documentation for metadata and nextjs has a metadata data API and we are using App router make sure that you are using App router not Pages router and you can export this metadata I'll show you how to do this so you can do something like this so let's go to blog page. TSX and I can export metadata from here I I can export like this and let's import metadata from next okay so I'll say blocks programming with Harry let's go for description uh let's go to chat gbt we have chart gbt to our rescue uh ride description for a coding block okay it will write it automatically okay so I think I should be able to copy this and paste it I was actually expecting it to complete it didn't but it's fine I think a better prompt would have worked all rights let's see if it is even changing if I go to blogs yeah it is changing title is changing and The Meta description is also changing I'll show you programming with har and as you can see that we have this meta description tag a comprehensive blog for coders of all levels nice nice so the thing is that Google algorithm is based of uh the fact that if you are actually serious about your blog and if you actually provide value then only your website will Rank and if you are serious about your blog you should have all the titles in meta descriptions at place okay let's go to blog now and I should be able to get the title here as well so I'll show you how we can do that and all I'm doing is using the I'm using the documentation of next year I'm not doing anything new which which even you guys can do and we are going to now use generate metadata function and this generate metadata function will generate the metadata so let's copy this and let's come to our blog post and we can export it like this we can say export async generate metadata let's import it from next and let's import this from next as well update import from next and update import from next script okay and we have uh okay so this is never read I think it would be great if I copy it like this and if I paste it like this and I don't want this I think it says that duplicate identifier okay duplicate identifier okay I should copy it only once okay now let's scroll down and do I have any issue here yeah so all the issues are resolved now and all I need to do now is return the proper title return the proper images return the proper description okay description I should be able to return the proper description and in order to return the proper description all I need to do is copy this so let's copy this let's copy this and let's paste it here and I'll get rid of this yeah so we have params do Slug and it say that slug does not exist on type ID let's remove this perams perm. slug okay so they already have some props here we'll have to update the props so the perams should have Slug and it should also have title which is a string and it should also has have a description which is a string yeah these are our props those were there St so I'll say title product do title do we have a title uh instead of saying product I'll have to say um blog I'll say blog blog. title and description description blog. description and that's all I want to import I'll remove this open graph image and in order to fetch the blog I think I'll have to copy the code from here um data okay so instead of saying blog I'll have to say data because we have title and description in data so I think we are good now and we should be able to get the title and meta description as you can see we have this ultimate Python tutorial as The Meta description if you want what you can do is you can use a template literal I'll show you how to do that so I'll say Dash programming with Harry and let's use dollar and you can spend another half an hour and 1 hour to get all the open graph images read more about SEO and making this even better and I'll remove the content from this because all I need is data and as you can see the title has been updated and if I refresh this page you can see that it works it just works I'll do the same for about and contact page as well but I think it should be as easy as we did for homepage okay guys before we wrap the video I want to show you how you can show line numbers and how you can draw attention to a certain line and certain word so all you need to do is go to this rehive pretty code homepage go to examples uh sorry go to the homepage and you can select word highlighting and I'll show you how to highlight words all you need to do is let me see where it is I'm still searching for where it is okay so all you need to do is write something like this and the moment you do this I'll show you let me go to my cont content so this is the code where I'm I want to show the line num so I'll say show line numbers and also you'll have to copy this CSS and you have to paste it in your global. CSS so let me paste it to my global. CSS and it will work now so if I refresh you can see that I'm getting line numbers it is very important to copy this CSS and paste it in your global. CSS now I can say show line numbers and also I can highlight a word or I can highlight a complete line for example if I want to highlight say line number one I can say I want to highlight line number one to five now in order to highlight the line you'll have to copy another set of CSS uh so what happens is basically whenever you write line number one to say one or two to line number one and line number three to 5 should be highlighted so basically with this line I'm saying that line number one and line number 3 to 5 should be highlighted and I also want to show line numbers but this will not actually highlight the line but it will add the class name and I'll have to write CSS corresponding to that class name so let's see if it is adding the class names now if I do right click inspect you'll see that it has added a class data highlighted line and also it has added data line it's it's actually not class name it has added this attribute and we'll have to Target our element by using this attribute so I I'll see how they have done it and then we'll simply copy that CSS so let's copy this copy copy CS copy selector so I just copy the selector I should be able to copy the CSS copy Rule and I think yeah I'm able to copy this Rule and let's paste this rule inside our global. CSS and the moment I do that I should be able to see the highlighted lines you can see that we have highlighted the lines which is great we have viated line number one and we have viated line number three to five now you can also draw attention to a given word and how you can do that is you can do something like this you can say I want to highlight carrot in line number 3 to5 you can either highlight a word for for example I want to highlight first name here so I'll do something like this I'll come to my code I'll say I want to highlight first name so if I do right click inspect first name if I do you can see that I've highlighted first name here I've highlighted first name here now this is looking very bright so I can change I can change the style so you can see that the color has been changed here and data highlighted CS let me see if there is a data highlighted CS I think there is a data highlighted CS in my CSS I will have to change it I will have to change the data highlighted Cs and how do I do that data highlighted CS I actually want to change the CSS of this it's giving it a yellow color which I don't like so how do I change the color of this so I'll copy this data I let it C and I'll say give it a background of background color should be yellow and it it should be a very light yellow I don't need a dark yellow it should be a very light yellow and if I refresh you'll see that it's a very light yellow okay and let me see if it works on dark mode as well yeah it works on dark mode as well so you can highlight it like this I think I should be using gray color I should be using a darker color for it to be visible and you can always tweak all that okay you can always tweak it I think I have chosen a very dark color let's refresh and see yeah this looks this looks fine you can always choose a color which makes your highlights look good you can go and experiment with CSS but this is basically how you do it now very quickly I show you how to use type JS let us say you want to add a typing effect here so you can go to type JS type JS and it is a JavaScript typing animation Library it gives an effect of let me show you the live demo so it actually helps you do something like this let's install it first pnpm install type JS pnpm install type JS pnpm install type JS and after that all you need to do is import typed and let's copy the reactjs usage so I'll copy the import let's go to our homepage and then we'll have to use use effect uh I think I'll have to use it in in a component which is a server component sorry client component I can make this a client component by the way use client and I can use use effect and do something like this okay let's use this use effect and all I need to do after this is and I'll have to use the US F Also let's copy this let's put it inside this and and then all I need is this span element and everything else will be taken care of so I'll add span so whenever you want the cursor you can add this pen that that's the story Landing SES Tailwind CSS components using Tailwind CSS let me do let me add the span here and I'm going to import use effect and use ref so add use ref add all missing Imports and let's see if this works let's see if this works actually let's see if this works yeah it works it just works okay so let's add using Tailwind CSS tail V CSS and you can expand this array and you are going to get whatever you want and deact single code types script script let's see how it looks let's refresh and react and typescript and this is how we can make a tech blog this really looks fantastic if you want to part two of this video and if you want me to cover dashboard and everything make sure you comment and I'm going to definitely show you how to do that so yeah I hope you like this video I really enjoyed doing this video if you want more next year's projects let me know and I'll definitely bring some more content on this channel thank you so much guys for watching this video and I will see you next time"
oAYuGx8BINI,"GitHub copilot is free Microsoft has recently announced that GitHub copilot is now available free of cost for all the developers they announced this through their recent blog and now giup copilot is absolutely free to try if you go to their plan and pricing page you'll see that there is a free tier available but the catch is that you get only up to 50 interactions per month for free and up to 2,000 real-time code completions free of cost if you want to go beyond this limit you can always upgrade to Pro business or Enterprise in my opinion this is one of the best moves by Microsoft out because a lot of people always wanted to try out GitHub copilot but they never did because of budget constraints so go ahead download GitHub copilot and try it out because it's now free"
XKqCWD_JoxQ,in this video I'll discuss with you whether you should be using Wordpress or not in 2023 and as we are approaching in 2024 is using Wordpress even worth your efforts or not today we are going to discuss all these things let's get into the video so I would like to start this video by discussing what exactly is WordPress WordPress is a Content management system which is based on PHP and you don't have to know how to write code in order to use WordPress now even if you are a coder I would recommend WordPress because WordPress saves a lot of time when it comes to publishing your content managing seo let us imagine a scenario where you are developing a website and you are actually writing code to develop that website now if you're using Wordpress you can save a lot of time writing code and optimizing your code then finding bugs and testing your code using Wordpress is amazing for publishing content because WordPress is made just to focus on your content you don't have to write any code all you need to do is install WordPress after choosing an appropriate hosting and you are good to go this is the reason I run my content websites on WordPress WordPress is a very old framework and it is really optimized we are recently at version six of Wordpress and version six of Wordpress is even impressive if you can use WordPress with some of the plugins then it is cherry on top of the cake because WordPress is already so powerful and installing plugins on top of that like Elementor Elementor widgets and choosing Elementor hosting in order to do all these things will save you a lot of time and efforts I'll tell you why later in this video let's discuss about what exactly is a page in Word press and what is a post the page in WordPress is just like an about page contact page which shows some information some images some videos and some static information now when you're publishing your content on WordPress you want your content to be published dynamically and incrementally as you add blog posts so let us say I'm writing a blog post on how to use JavaScript efficiently or let us say I'm writing a blog post on WordPress tutorial I can add those incrementally on a single blog page and I can manage my widgets just like the way I want using Wordpress will also save you a lot of time when it comes to SEO and optimizing your site because WordPress already has all these tools built in and you don't have to explicitly learn SEO in order to optimize your website now there is a concept of plugins in WordPress where you can enhance the functionality of your WordPress website by installing additional plugins for example Elementor is a plugin which can be used to add some beautiful widgets then Elementor also has a lot of templates built in which will save a lot of time when it comes to breiding your blog publishing your blog and growing your business typically when you are writing and Publishing content on your WordPress website you want your website to rank on Google which in turn will increase traffic to your site thereby increasing your sales or making you money in ad Revenue Now using Elementor will make your life as a WordPress developer really very easy because all you need to do is drag and drop click plus to add some widgets and you can customize your website the way you want so you should always choose proper plugins when you are building your website using WordPress now you must be thinking why can't I simply use AI to build my website why do I need WordPress you need WordPress because even WordPress is growing with AI you will have the luxury of installing element plugin and use elementer AI if you're using Elementor to host your website now this is really a big deal because you can simply give your prompts and customize your website the way you want so trust me learning WordPress is very easy and when you are choosing WordPress you get an entire built website with the theme of your choice with the color of your choice with the customization of your choice and if you are installing plugins like Elementor you can entirely customize your website the way you want now let's talk about what exactly hosting is whenever you are creating a website be it using Wordpress or be it using HTML CSS or JavaScript your clients will come to your website your server will process the information that is present let us say it will pull some data from the database or maybe it will pull some page to serve to the clients your client will then see that page code and it will pass it in the browser this is something I teach in all my web development boot camps now what is important is that there are two types of hostings one is shared hosting and the other one is dedicated hosting when you're going for shared hosting a lot of people will get the same server to serve their clients let's say there's a company a and there's a company B and there's a company C all these three companies will get the same server if they're opting for shared hosting and this hosting or say a particular computer will be provided to all those three people or say all those three companies and their clients will be served through this particular server now the problem we shared hosting is let us say your CPU goes to 100% all the clients will suffer or if your shared hosting doesn't have enough resources your clients will definitely suffer because your pay speed will go down your downtime will be increased your rankings might go down in Google hence it becomes very important for you to choose a good hosting provider one of the best hosting providers that I have encountered is Elementary hosting and I recommend Elementor hosting not just because it is good reliable and is optimized for WordPress but because it has the least down time and you get a lot of added value if you opt for elementary hosting if you are buying Elemental hosting you can get a good deal on their Pro widgets and their Pro subscription which in my opinion is cherry on the cake now element is a plugin that anywh you have to use if you are using Wordpress you cannot avoid it if you want to create a beautiful website I have element installed on all my WordPress websites and I personally recommend it to everybody be it for Designing Pages or for Designing post another reason to use Elementor hosting is that it is optimized for Elementor fidgets and Elementor is going to work the best if you've opt for Elemental hosting it is really very friendly and it allows you to create and launch a website instantly the user interface is really good and on top of that you get everything you need to build your WordPress website in a single WordPress plan you get the elemental subscription and the hosting that you anyway have to pay so my recommendation for your next WordPress website site is Elemental hosting if you want heavy discounts check out the link in the description it's fast it's safe and I have personally used it without any hassles now there is another option for hosting which is cloud hosting in Cloud hosting your provider simply provides you with some set of scalable Cloud resources let us say if your traffic goes up your RAM will increase if needed and your CPU will increase if needed your website might be data intensive and might need some graphic memory and On Demand of your client and on demand of your website's load Cloud hosting will scale itself to catter your needs now we'll go to a computer screen and we'll see an Elementor hosting in action we'll see how Elementor can be used and also I'm going to show you why Elementor hosting is best for your WordPress website so actually I wanted to show you this Elementor hosting in action basically if you buy this Elementor hosting you get the manage WordPress hosting plus the Elementor plow builder then you get the themes and on top of that Elementor has a very good support now if you are going for WordPress hosting I highly recommend this one because of the performance and reliability and the additional items that you getting with this now Elementor has 99.9% of up time with extra security built-in and they also have a CDN which means that if you have some content and you want it to be delivered to the users very fast you can do that let us say you are building your website from India and you have some users in United States some users in Canada some users in London your content will be cached in London in United States as well as in Canada now this will help help your users to access your website really very fast because your content is ready to be served in United States to the United States users in Canada to the Canadian users in London to the people living in London this way your website gets really very fast and Elementor does a really good job because they provide high-speed CDM by Cloud flare if you're not familiar with Cloud flare let me tell you that they have the top notch content delivery Network and their content delivery network is the best now they also have a staging tool which can help you push your websites to staging environment which means that uh you can try out your website now if you haven't seen my video on staging local as well as uh production environments uh I've mentioned in that video that if you have a very basic website and you want to build it you'll have to first go to your local environment and then once the development process is over you'll stage that website and once the staging is done you actually go ahead and publish that website to production staging and production environments have very similar characteristics the only difference is that you are testing your website while you're staging it and when you go to production you are actually making your website live for all the viewers so this is what the difference between all these three is now there is one more thing I want to mention about and uh it is called local WP so local WP is a software which you can install and this basically helps you with local WordPress development as you can see in this figure that uh we have created a lot of Wordpress websites and you can actually use it for free you don't have to pay for it all you you need to do is download this piece of software for free and you can actually spin as many local WordPress websites as you want I love this tool because before this tool or you can say before I knew about this tool I used to use zamp the setup was very cumbersome I used to use Apache MySQL PHP then I used to set up WordPress from scratch which was a pain I I am able to do it but the problem is that it takes a lot of time with local WP all I need to do is simply click here uh I'll stop all my sites then I'll click on Plus I can create a new site I can say continue and I can say element site and then I can continue and then once again so Elementor site is being added it will ask you to allow this piece of software uh through firewall uh let me allow this through firewall and once everything is done I will be back so it is basically asking for some Force redirection because it has to serve my website from the URL Elementor site. Lo so I can actually go to Elementor site. loal and it will open my WordPress website which is amazing now it's installing WordPress which is going to take some time so let's wait for it to install WordPress for us and then I'll be back so now Elemental site has been added as you can see so it is asking me to uh view the website as you can see we have the wp admin at place I can say root root and if you want remember the user ID and password you can check this box and then click login so as you can see we have this uh WordPress installed and uh we can simply go to plugins and add new and we can install Elementor by following these steps I'll search for Elementor I'll search for it and I'll simply click on install now and the moment I do that the Elementor plug-in will be installed the next step will be to activate the plug-in and once I've activated the plugin it will ask me to connect my WordPress to the Elementor account which I'll do and then from there I'll start using Elementor now if you are using Elementor hosting the best part is that you get to get all the Elementor Pro features for free I'm going to activate it and once I do that I can actually either skip or simply connect my account so I'll simply connect my account which I'm already locked loed into if you are not logged into your Elementor account you can simply log in and I can continue with hello theme or you can also later switch to theme Builder and start building a website using theme Builder I'll name it element a site I'll skip this one I'll start with the blank canvas or you can also browse through the templates that Elementor already have and if you are using Elementor hosting you'll have access to all these templates you can also use AI image generator and a lot of other built-in features so you can explore it and start building your website from here now not only this you can also make multiple websites and host them using local WP you can click on plus and create a new site and let us say I'll I can name it element two I'll click on continue and I can simply keep it as root and root and click on ADD site and this will actually add another element to website here and I can choose to either run it or stop it you can even run multiple websites and access them on their respective URLs and you can see the URL as element site. loal okay let me allow this which is actually a very good thing because you get the feel of a real domain instead of the local host and if you are using zamp or some other tool to set up WordPress on Local Host it is actually a lot of pain because I have personally deployed a lot of Wordpress websites and without local WP it takes a lot of time first of all secondly your setup is prone to a lot of errors and if you are a beginner and if you are stuck into something uh you might uh end up spending say 3 4 hours in fixing all those things so I hope that you understand how you can use all these tools and how Elemental hosting can actually be your Swiss army knife while you are developing website one of the best things about Elementor is that they have their kit and uh in their website kit they have a lot of designs you'll get 100 plus readymade designs which you can work seamlessly with for example let us say you want to create a blog or let us say you want to create an e-commerce website you already have built-in templates for that so this is something that I love about Elementor and if you are using Elementary hosting all this is free then on top of this you get a lot better header and Footers customization I love this type of customization because the best thing about this is that it's very intuitive plus it kind of solves a lot of problem that WordPress has when it comes to user friendliness you can change the background you can change the width you can change the layout everything is as simple as using a computer then they also have a woocommerce builder and you can edit your store with the power of element turn now if you're not familiar with vcommerce let me tell you that it is a framework to create e-commerce website with WordPress and if you use element on top of that it will really help you in your workflow now you get an extra speed not because this hosting is the best but also because you're using Elementor which is optimized for this type of Hosting your website is built using Elementor and the Elementor hosting is optimized for websites using Elementor then last but not the least Elementor AI is really powerful if you want me to build a website for you using Elementor AI let me know in the comments below and I'll show you how to create a website using Elementary AI as you can see here that you can give a prompt and and you can simply edit change or regenerate your content just like you do using chart GPT but this time you going to build websites using Elementor this is really something I love you can use generative fill you can use all those AI features which you have probably seen somewhere or the other but this time all these features will be available right into your dashboards so I hope you enjoyed this video we discussed about hosting we discussed about why WordPress is good why it is important and why creating a WordPress website can ask actually be a good idea for you if you're using Elemental hosting and Elemental widgets now if you want a video on how to create a WordPress website and to and do let me know and I'll come up with a video wherein we will discuss how to create a website step by step and then host it on Elemental thank you so much guys for watching this video and I will see you next [Applause] [Music] time [Music]
bj_WGitydcc,one of the most asked questions in the python Community is that how to create a website end-to-end just using Python and in this video we are going to look at a tool which can help us build web applications by using only python you'll be able to use database you'll be able to use backend and also you'll be able to incorporate your complex logic into your python applications so let's move on to a computer screen and we'll cover all these things let's get started alright so the very first step that we are going to take is signing up on Anvil so let's move on to the computer screen and let's sign upon Anvil dot works so I'll go to anvil.works and as you can see the steps to build a website using python are written here but we want to try Anvil for free and we want to sign up first now if you don't have an envel.works account you can create one or you can simply sign in with Google I'm going to sign in with Google and let me tell you that I already have an account on animal.works because I have been using it for a while now so let's click on sign up with Google and yeah so here is an option to create a new app now from here I can create a new app and it gives me some options to create apps like it can we can create a blank app we can also create an expense approval system we can create a static website task manager a lot of other things but I want to go very basic here because I want you to understand how Anvil works so let's click on this blank app and let's start building this blank app I'll click on material design 3 because I love the design material design 3 theme with an app bar and optional left navigation menu let's select this one and our app is building and yes now we can start building our app by simply dropping a Title Here by simply dropping some links here and we can also use all these components to make our website just by using simple drag and drop how amazing is that so let's get started and let's start working on it let's change the name of our app so this is the name of our app the moment I click on M3 app one it shows me the name of my app I'll say my gym membership form and let us say we own a gym and we want to create a form for our gym members we can always do that by renaming your app to my gym membership forms so that our users or rather we as developers of this app will see the correct name okay let's choose a choose an app title I'll say my gym and let's choose an app description so I'll write my gym is the best gym in Delhi okay I'm assuming a place so let's say my gym is the best gym in Delhi we offer we offer a lot of Services blah blah blah you can always you know type an app description for your app and then you can also upload a logo let me see if I can upload an image so I have uploaded this PNG and uh I know this is not the best logo out there but I just want to show you how you can change your app logo and then you can simply save it and I think it saves on the go which means that I don't have to save it let's go back let's close and you know you can always come back here and all these things can be changed now let's see how we can create an app but before that I want to discuss why you should use Anvil now at times you want to create an app which is very basic like a very basic application which simply takes the user data and it simply dumps into the database and when you are creating such an app you will never want to set up the development environment I mean coding is great HTML is great CSS Java script everything is great even the sand will not works is made using HTML CSS JavaScript right but the thing is that sometimes it makes more sense for us to use such Services because one they can save us a lot of time secondly they are very secure because this framework is well tested and this system of building this application is well tested and thirdly if you know only python you can create complex applications using analysis not your another drag and drop UI Builder this contains backend this contains database and everything is well managed moreover you can even publish the app so this is something which is worth discussing and this is something which is worth trying which is why I'm creating this app so you can always create your complex applications using HTML CSS JavaScript or any backend like node.js but if you ever come across a situation where you have to create a simple app and you want to save your time and you want to make sure that your app is secure such kind of Builders can be a boon okay so let's now start start building the app and I'll show you how Anvil works and how we can create uis in Anvil so we have this toolbar towards the right which has all these components as you can see we have a label display text component let me drag it here and I can type anything inside the text field and that text field is going to be the placeholder so let me type enter your name enter your name and I can also change the font size so let me go ahead and change the font size icon layout let me check layout appearance and the Border background and anything uh can be changed let me find where the font size is it's here let me change the font size to 20 and let me make it bold I think it doesn't look very good when I pulled it so let me keep it as is and I can always click on run in a new tab and it will show me this enter your name let me complete this form by adding some more components I can always add this text pause let me add a text box and let me go back to this UI design and let me change the text of this text boss to something like and your name and your name and if I restart this UI will be updated which means that I can have a look at what is and will building live so this thing will be previewed here and that will be real time the moment I click on restart which is great let me add another text so let me add another display text and let me call it end your weight and once again I'm going to change the font size to 20. 20 and I think the font size of this was 20 as well align left font size 20 let's restart and see how it looks it looks pretty good and let me once again come back here and add another text box and enter your weight let's let's say enter your weight you can also change the type to number and this will be updated as input type is equal to number which is good from SEO standpoint because it can help Google in other search engines to understand what your content is about and it's always good okay so let's add some placeholder and your weight in kilograms okay let's uh try to see how our app look at this point and let's let's add another field do you need a membership discount so let's add another label so label three let me call this label as [Music] um do you need personal training and if somebody needs personal training they can always click or check the check box that I'm going to add below it okay let me change the font size to 20. and let me find out a component which I can use and the component is checkbox let's name this checkbox as let me name it as yes if you need personal training you are going to check this checkbox okay and that should be it let's see how our app looks at this point you need personal training yes you can check this checkbox awesome you can enter the name you can enter your weight in kilograms note that if you try to enter some text it is not going to work because by default we have changed the type of this field to number okay so you can only enter numbers here and let me click here and this is the uh enter your name let me change the name to placeholder because I don't want this text this is the default value of this input and this is the placeholder so I'm meant to add a placeholder so let's restart our app and this way you can start typing and you can start entering your weight and you can say yes and let me also add wheat in kgs okay and that should pretty much do for the UI but once again let me show you some other components you can always drag and drop all these components we have a file component if you are looking to create a complex application with a lot of images you can also add a custom component but at this point I'm going to drop a title here so let me call this as my gym let me let me say my gym and let me add some more links here so let's say home and then I'll drag another one and say about about look how easy it is to create a website using anvil imagine imagine if you were to create the same website using HTML CSS JavaScript Django and node.js or something else you'll have to face a lot of hassle just for creating a form even with PHP it's not that simple and with Anvil you can create it only by using python you will have an option to publish it you have an option to debug it which means you can preview it live amazing contact us and that should be good to go let's restart the app and see how it looks it looks pretty amazing at this point I want to actually change this to bold and also increase the font size to 24 and see how it looks and yes it looks good because this is a the main branding of our app this is the logo of our app and I want it to be you know pretty different from other components of the web page and I think a UI is almost done all we need to do at this point is to add a submit button so let's call this button as submit submit submit and let's align it towards the left and I think this is looking pretty clean looks pretty straightforward and you can forward this form to your friends and they will fill it now the next step is very important and the next step is to get all this data to the database and do you need a database do you need coding no you don't because Anvil comes with database you can always add a database here and I'll show you how exactly to finish this stuff so by default Android already has a database and you can always create a new database so let's add a new database so we can even use a default database okay let me use a default database and I'm going to create a new table called GM inside this database so all you need to do is type the name of the table and that should do okay let's create this table this table has been created and now you can add new column to this table so let's click on new column and let's add a text column and let's call it name and let's call this uh another column as age sorry wait we had weight and then another Boolean column let me name it as personal whether the person needs a personal training or not and let's add another text column as address now we don't have the address column yet in our app so you can always do that you will also see how easy it is to add another column okay in your database and another field in your form so let's create another field let me call this label as address address and let's change the font size to 20. font size to 20 you can even change the font and let's add a text area I'm going to add a text area at this point because text area is slightly different from input type is equal to text in a way that text area can be used uh it looks it actually looks different and you can easily type long text inside of text area Okay so you'll see how it looks all right your address so let me add a placeholder your address and let's see how it looks restart the app and this is how it looks do you need personal training yes you can always bring this below and restart your app and this drag and drop interface is amazing I really love it the text area is different from input type is equal to text in a way that this text area can be dragged like this you can drag it and keep typing and you cannot drag this thing because this is input type is equal to text if you inspect the code you will see this is input class is all this type is equal to number and this is text area if you inspect this this is a text area so these are two different HTML elements let's go back to our table and we created a table inside of our database let's click here and let's go back to our table and our database is created okay now all we need to do is come up with a way such that whenever we click on the submit button the data should go to the database and believe me that is also really very simple I'll show you how now a lot of people who are python developers they don't have a very good understanding of how websites work so let me explain how websites work first this is the front end of our website and if I right click and click on view page source and this is applicable for any website this is not annual specific concept this is web development specific concept okay so this code is HTML code and our browser is responsible for rendering this to our browser okay so whatever ever you see is a result of this code and this code has all the information to display this okay now whenever a user sees this they can always see which code is actually rendering this but they cannot see which code is generating this because a code might connect to the database the code can fetch some data connect to the database validate some credentials and after that return all this HTML all that execution is done on the backend side so a website's back end is not visible to the client what is visible to the client is the code which is used to render this and how this code is generated is done as a part of backend okay so our anvils backend is inside our Anvil application in the form of server module so we can add a server module this client code is done this is visible to everybody and our client can very well decide to right click on his browser and click view page source and see the code but what he cannot see is the server side code which we are writing and we are going to write a server side code now this code is going to execute in the Anvil server which our client will never see only we will have the access to this code so let's create a server module and in order to run this code in Anvil we need to uncomment this and use this decorator called envel.server.collable let me change the method name to submit and let's say this submit takes name weight address and personal so we'll say name we'll say we it will say address and personal and I want to say that whenever somebody clicks on the submit button please execute this and once you execute this the data will go to the database so we are going to write the code now so let me keep it as is for the time being and let's go to our app let's go to design and let's go to the submit button and I'll say that whenever somebody clicks on the submit button I want this method to be run okay so I need name name is equal to I'll say self Dot and self dot let me see what is the label for this text box one then we have text box two then we have text area one then we have check box one okay now I remember all this so let's go back to the code and name is equal to self Dot text box one this is the name and I'll say dot text okay and the second thing that I want to get is the weight I'll say weight is equal to self dot uh text box two text box to Dot and I need the text of this once again and this gives me an error okay so the error is gone and then we have address is equal to self dot text area one text area one dot text and then check is equal to self dot checks box one dot check whether it is checked or not okay now I want to execute or submit function so I'll say Anvil dot server dot call and I'll just submit call this submit and I want to give name weight address and personal okay and personal so let me call this personal and not checked so let me call this personal so name weight address and personal is passed to this submit function let's finish our server module submit function now in order to add data to the database I'll say app tables dot Jim dot add row and I'll say name is equal to name weight is equal to weight and address is equal to address and personal is equal to personal and this will add a row to a database so how how is this operating let me show you once again how all this is working together we have a database which is called gem the name of the table is Gem and these are the fields in that database okay now we have a UI which looks like this and whenever somebody clicks on the submit button this function is called right after somebody clicks on submit button this function is triggered and this function grabs the name weight address and personal these four fields and then it calls the submit button with these four values now the control goes to the server module and this function actually runs which does nothing but adds a row to our database with name weight address and personal which was entered by our user okay so it's really very simple nothing to worry about now I also want to show a notification whenever somebody submits a data so I'll say notification and then I'll say your data has been submitted your data has been submitted okay submitted and that's all I think I think we are good and let's try to restart the app and see if this work I'll say Harry 23 add do I need a personal training no I don't let's submit and it says that neem notification is not defined so the problem here is that I will have to cut this and I will have to paste it here so this notification part will be done here let me let me see if this notification is imported automatically or not so when we say from and we'll import Star this notification is automatically imported so we need not worry about it let's now once again enter value as one one one and submit and I think we are good but we didn't see any notification why so not sure let's see if there is any data in the database let's refresh and yes the data is going to the database but we don't see any notification which is a problem okay I got it why we are not seeing the notification we'll have to call the show method of the notification and there are a lot of other parameters which you can customize you can go to the Anvil docs once again animal docs are great you can always go there and you'll learn new ways of doing things and you'll learn how to create complex applications using Anvil so let's restart it once again and let's fill this form Harry and then we'll say 12 and this is my submission and let's say I need personal training so I'm going to check it submit your data has been submitted let's see if it is actually submitted or not let's refresh the table and yes it is submitted in see how this time this personal is actually being checked which means that I need personal training and this is my submission is the address amazing you can also add data to the database from here but again see how cool is this and you can also download this as CSV so it's not like you cannot take this data away download this data as CSV and you can launch this data and you can analyze this data this is really great I mean this is amazing okay so feel free to open the CSV with Ms Excel or feel free to even analyze this data using python pandas you can use matplotlab if you are a data scientist you know what I'm talking about but again this is how you can create apps using Anvil you can always come back to your form and you can change it you can explore different ways of making this more interactive you can add a sidebar here you can add a column panel which will add a sidebar here so creating UI is using Anvil is also very simple you can always come back to this page change your apps logo change your app's description and N will take scan of the SEO and I'll show you how it takes care of SEO it will add all these meta descriptions meta tags which maybe if you are creating your application in a hurry you will never do it because you will not afford to get time to do it but nville doesn't disappoints us here so in a way Anvil is something which every python developer in my opinion should know about at least another thing I like about envelope is that you can use and will to get emails whenever a form is submitted and it supports it out of the box so you can click on ADD you can click on email and you can even use a custom build server but I'm not going to use a custom mail server rather what I'm going to do is I'm going to use the built-in email service from Anvil so let's copy this code I'm going to copy this code and let's paste it here so in a server module we can always send an email and from my app support or rather I'm going to say my gym submission submission and let's change the 2 to Harry at codeword.com and let's change the subject to your form and let's create an F string and I'm going to create an app string and say a sub Mission from and I'll say name and then the weight is I'll say weight and address is I'll say address and once again and he needs personal training and person let's see if the app is sending out emails or not let's change the name to Harry and 34 Bob's address let's say yes personal training is needed and you can always code your application such that it sends the email of your choice you can create this as a variable generate a very beautiful kind of email and and will will deliver your emails so let's see if this email is delivered to my inbox or not so I just received this email and this is from manual dot app here is the submission from Harry the way to study for and the address is Bob's Edison he needs personal training true okay so this is how you can start getting emails from envel and I really love this feature from Anvil now let me know in the comment section what you would like to see what you are going to build next using and will I want all of you to tell me in the comment section now another cool feature of anvil is this publish button right here you can publish your application without any hassles you don't have to buy a domain well if you want you can have a custom domain and Link it to Anvil which is a plus but you don't have to buy a domain you don't have to spend any money with hosting services and on top of that you don't have to hire a devops engineer or if your devops skills are not on point no worries if you just need python or if you are a beginner and you are just starting out Simply click this publish button publish this up and this will give you a URL which you can always copy and let me open a guest window here let me paste this URL and your app is live two clicks is what it takes to get your app live amazing right I really love this and let's try this try out 12 trying out and filling address and I'll say yes I need personal training and let's submit this and the data has been submitted let's close it and let's see if we can see the data here try out trying out amazing man like this is this is really really some good stuff you should definitely try this out I've published this application you can use this link and you can try to fill the swamp and create one on your own and you can use your python skills the existing python skills that you have to build a website so I really feel that Anvil is amazing and I hope that you felt likewise and you will build your apps using Anvil so go ahead explore the Anvil documentation and you'll learn a lot and you will find ways to create even better apps and even more complex apps using Anvil and using your existing python skills so that was all about this video thank you so much

my first time building a website I'll click on next and let's name it code with Harry I'll name my website as code with Harry and I'll click on next now elementer provides some of the site kits as you can see we have personal stylist private tool guide we have alternate medicine one page a lot of different website templates now if you want to start from a scratch you can always go and say I would rather start from scratch but I don't recommend that because Elementor has all these website kits for you you can go and search for blog and you'll get some of the blog websites I'm going to use this one this food blog one let us say we are running a food blog and I want to get started as fast as possible I'll click here preview this kit which will show me how this website is going to look like in different devices and yes this is looking pretty good wow it has a lot of Po by default and I can use this kit I guess so I'll simply go ahead and check this there are a lot of pages and I'll also show you how to customize this but let's go ahead after previewing this website you can click at the top start with this kit and this is going to create your website very quickly now it says grab a coffee it's going to take about 5 minutes but let me tell you from my experience is it is going to take very less amount of time not even five minutes much lesser than five minutes so let's wait for it to activate the pro plugin and as you can see I've have not edited this video Tada your site is ready I guess it took around 30 40 seconds now one thing I want to suggest is you should wait for some time until element is installed everything is provisioning and only after everything is provisioned I will recommend you to use this hosting because Elementor takes some time to cool down and install everything it's a personal suggestion otherwise if you want to use it right away you can always do that but at least wait for 5 minutes let me tell you about this site log is on do you see that site log is on I'll tell you about that if you click on manage this website and you go and scroll down you'll see the site lock what is a site lock basically your site is locked until you uh ensure that everything is working and until you decide to make your website live there is this pin code which you'll have to enter whenever you are going to or trying to access your website this is just for security purpose and anybody who access your website before it is finalized will have to enter this spin so if I click here it says sorry this website is hidden right now you'll have to enter a pin so anybody who wants to access this website will have to punch in this pin and only after he or she punches in the pin will he or she be able to access my website so as you can can see I can always edit my website with Elementor because I am logged into my WordPress hosting and if somebody wants to preview this site they will have to enter this pin which in my case is 6595 6495 I guess I hope I have entered it correctly let's wait for it and only if you have entered it correctly you will be able to access your website and once you have entered this correctly you will see your website and your website is basically ready you don't have to do anything but you can always customize it you can change the images you can go ahead and you know upload your logo you can change the menu bar you can change all these images and you can customize your website as per your liking very soon I'm going to show you Elementor AI as well but before that let's click edit with Elementor let's wait for this it's loading the Elementor plugin and you can customize your website now let us say I want to add some some some elements maybe a container something you can always go ahead and check the structure this is hero structure this is website title and then again this is another section of the website and you'll see all these sections here so basically it summarizes the structure for you and once you see the structure and everything is looking fine you can always come here and search for widgets there is heading image and a lot of things let's say I want to change this logo how do I change the logo so there is a pencil icon at the right of this logo now once you click this spencil icon you can always upload a file or you can choose a file which you already have in your media library I'll go to my media library and select a file and as you can see this file will serve as my logo you'll have to click save changes and it takes some time definitely to for changes to take place and let's wait for some time and once your website basically up gets this logo in the back end your logo will start appearing it happens instantly so if you reload your website you'll see this logo did you see that this logo has been updated wow awesome now let us say I want to change the menu let us say I want to see home about or something or if you want to see the structure you can always see the structure of the header we have site logo and this WordPress menu how do I change this WordPress menu you'll have to go to Wordpress dashboard and then go to appearance and then menu so appearance and then menus and once you go to menus you can always add another item to the menu so as you can see we only have this single about page in our menu I can always click on view all and add more pages let us say I want to create a page and add it to the menu I can always do that so these are some of the settings which you see you can always play around with these it's a simple WordPress menu if you don't know what a WordPress menu is it's basically collection of pages or collection of posts you can always add more pages here and as you can see we have a page called Elementor sample homepage and I can always click on this homepage and add it to the menu and it is giving me some error Let Me Wait okay so uh it has happened finally and if I reload this page you'll see this home and about is being shown because I have added home to my menu you can create multiple menus in WordPress always but this is how my website is looking um not this this is how my website is looking if you reload your website you going to to see this wow you can always customize this header you can always add more pages to the menu sky is the limit you can do everything the website is looking amazing at this point now you can always preview how your website is looking and if you don't like any item you can always change that you can always change the images you can change all the text that you are seeing now if you click on this new and then if you click on page you can add a new page let me create a page called blog and click on Save and your page has been created I can always edit this block page and I can customize it as per my liking I can click on this plus I can drag and drw the widgets and I'll be able to see how they appear now let us say I want to add this image and let us say I want to add this image as my uh you know topmost image now let us say I want to reduce the width or say height of this image I can always do that by going to style uh did you see that style below edit image this one one and you can simply increase width height Max width Max height it's always good to understand basic concepts of web development like object fit so that you can make it cover and this image will not lose its aspect ratio now you can click on plus and you can always select your structure this is something I love about Elementor all these structure layouts are really very good you can choose this one this will basically stack all the items as you know rows and this will stack items horizontally as columns and you can play around with all these layouts now you'll use these layouts if you want to create something like this or something like um you know let us say I want to add something here what should I take maybe I can drag post so let me search for post I can always use a search bar or let me search for post here manually you can always type for posts you can always type P SS posts and you'll be able to get the post let me drag and drop something here so let's say I want to drag and drop post let me search for post and you will be able to see all the WordPress post which will be visible here okay so it's not looking good because it is basically giving me three posts and three columns which are not looking good you can always delete and you can delete this layout as well if you don't like you can click on plus and let's say I want to Stack all my posts for ially and I want only single column you can always add more structures you can add more layouts and keep on designing your page and it's really very easy now if I drag post here you can see all my posts are visible here now let's go to the Styles and let's style this a bit I'll go to box and add some padding so that it looks little better than it is looking without the padding you can always customize all these things there are a lot of settings and you can always use all all these settings to customize this page sky is the limit and this is really looking good at this point so as you can see this blog page is looking good you can always publish the page once you are done uh and if you spend some more time I'm sure uh I trust you you are going to design a better page than I have done in few minutes but it's always very easy to go live with a website with Elementor and now if you go back you'll be able to open WP dashboard WordPress dashboard is something that you'll keep on coming back and you can go to post you can go to Pages you can you know use all these um menus you can customize these and let us say I want to add this blog page to the menu I can always do that and once I saved the menu you will be able to see that my blog page has been added to the menu now anybody if now any user if he clicks on the blog page he'll be directed to the the blog page and I could have designed it better but again I love this page still I love this page it's looking pretty good and you can keep on adding the post and your post will appear here I love this page I love this logo as well I love the fact that I've designed this website in very less amount of time now if you don't like this website or theme you can always change the theme or you can simply select a theme which you like make sure that you select the theme of your liking from the starting and you are going to be very happy with this now as you can see hosted by third party you'll have different sections here uh now let's Google local WP I want to show you how this local WordPress development tool works if you are developing websites locally you might use this and if you're logging in using Elementor to your local WordPress websites all your WordPress websites will appear in your Elementor dashboard which is amazing actually because you are able to see all your website you have ever built in your lifetime you can always click on hosted by elementa to see your hosted serious websites which you have hosted on elementa but if you have any hobby website and you have logged in using Elementor you can always see those now if you are buying a new hosting let me tell you this is the best time to buy element is the best hosting for WordPress because it comes with elementa Pro and the pricing is amazing service is amazing the CDN is fast SSL works you can buy this plan where you can get a website for $4 because you are able to get 10 websites for $41.99 isn't it amazing so I recommend this WordPress hosting if you are planning to go live with your WordPress website now go ahead keep customizing your website and it will look really good let me show you how you can edit this text with AI Elemental AI is amazing let me accept the terms and get started now with element AI you see all these buttons do you see all these buttons where you can uh choose to make it larger or make it shorter or you can always check for grammar let's say I'm writing I am Harry and I am a good chef and I have uh intentionally written this Chef wrong and let me complete this and then I'll ask Elementary I to fix is spelling and grammar let's see how it goes so let me click on this uh button and it has actually corrected it I am Harry and I am a good Chef I can cook Dal and rice very well in Indian style amazing so you can always use this and wow you can actually write a lot of text without leaving element using AI now ai is going to be around and people who are using AI are going to be preferred by companies if you are able to build a website say in 10 hours using Elementor it's going to be much much better than a software developer designing the same website doing the same thing in 10 or 20 days you are going to be faster you are going to get highed faster and you are definitely going to be rewarded for what you are doing now you can always go back to post and write some post this elementor's theme comes with a lot of posts let us say I want to write a post I can say hey I am n AI tool manager and let me add some text as well you can always add some serious post here but I'm going to Simply write AI tool manager here and let's publish this post without an image and you'll see that this post will come without an image let me read load this website and yes let's see if we are able to see the poster yes we are able to see the post but we have not added an image yet so let's add an image now if you go to featured image and if you select the featured image let's add this one as featured image and let's update and once I update this you'll see that I will be seeing my image as well along with my post title and exerpt so as you can see I'm seeing this image which I have added to this post and you can always add some serious posts and you can rank on Google if you write some good post but you don't have to spend a lot of time developing a website because you can always do that with elementer if you are planning to write a blog WordPress is the solution elementer is the hosting solution hands down the best one out there and let's see this website how everything is working you can go to blog can go to home and everything works just fine looking amazing so this is basically how you can build a website using Elementor and using some of the Elementor Pro plug-in widgets and Elementor provides a base theme and Elementor is the best hosting for WordPress because you get Elementor Pro and Elementor Pro is really good now if you want to point a domain to your hosting you can always use these DNS records which you can see below or you can simply click on buy a domain to buy a domain from element but if you already have a domain you can always point this domain to your Elemental hosting uh you can go back and you can simply Point your IP to this IP address or you can simply you know connect domain just enter your domain which you own and Elementor will basically show you the steps of how to verify the ownership of the domain and add it to your Elementor hosted website so you can go ahead you can sign into your hosting provider and Elementor will give you some options of verifying that website and finally pointing your domain to your hosting so Elementor is really very easy to use as you can see and it's really very easy to spin up a website using Elementor I hope you like this video and if you want me to build a website using AI from scratch let me know I'll make a video on that as well and once you have made a website using Elementary you'll realize that it's really easy to use and until unless you are making a complex website there's no need of using coding because you can always do everything using Elementor and you can always use drag and drop functionality the themes are there the plugins are there everything works great so I hope you like this video and uh if you like this video make sure to give it a thumbs up thank you so much guys for watching this video and I will see you next [Applause] [Music] time [Music]
s1MUcxO-x8Q,in this video I am going to show you how you can create a blog using app right Cloud nextges 13 and all of this is going to be really very simple we are going to use Nexus 13 for keeping things simple on front-end side and apparel cloud is going to make a life easier on backhand side how all these things are going to be coordinated is something that I'm going to show you in this video let's move on to our computer screen and let's get started [Music] so apprite is a backend that can be used for your mobile apps and it can be integrated to your web app it can be integrated to anything the very first step that we are going to take in order to build this project is signing up on apprite cloud so I am going to sign up on upright Cloud you can get the link in the description and you can sign up on update Cloud by simply visiting that link let us sign in with GitHub or you can also simply click on sign up and enter these information and I'm going to use a strong password and I will register for upright loud so let's click on sign up and I will get a get the activation email so it says join our Cloud hackathon I'm going to click on go to console because I want to directly go to the console and create my first project so today I am going to create a blog project using app right load so let me call it blog and create project and this project is created now if you are familiar with something like mongodb upright Cloud follows kind of the same pattern when it comes to storing data because in mongodb we have database and then we have collections we have documents so database collection documents and in upright as well we have the database collection and documents so here you can see add a platform so they have an SDK which makes it possible for you to add different platforms for your applications you can have a flutter app which is connected to this backend this is a single backend flutter app will be connected to this backend web app will be connected to this backend Apple app will be connected to this backend and the same backend can be used to connect your Android app as well so this feature is actually great and it makes app right very easy to use plus it makes your application very easy to manage I'll show you how let's click on web app and let's connect a web app I'm going to call this next js13 because I'm going to use Nexus 13 for my blog app and I'm going to type localhost in the host name now this host name is required because you are going to use localhost to connect to this backend if you are going to use something else you can add these star.netlyphi.app or gitbot.io or virtual.app if you are planning to connect your backend from these domains but since I'm going to use localhost I'll type localhost and I'll simply click next after that I'll install apprite which is compulsory but before we continue here let's go to Google and type next js13 app I'm going to use the create next app to create my next year's 13 app I'm going to click on installation or I think I I should I should enter this let's create a new folder or let's simply open a terminal inside code playground so if you are familiar with how I work on my code base I have a folder called code playground which contains my code base and I'm opening a terminal on code playground and I will create a new Next app inside this code playground folder so let's copy this command and let's paste it and it will ask me the name of the app I'll say blog app right no I don't want to use typescript I'm going to keep the default options and this is going to install react react Dom next year still when CSS CSS Auto prefixer and I'm going to use Tailwind CSS for this project so let's simply wait and I beat it for some time and as you can see we have successfully created a project called blog upright I will simply seed into that that folder CD blog app right blog Dash upright and let me type code dot so that I have vs code open with this folder as you can see we have created this folder and the next tab that I'm going to take is opening a terminal let me open this terminal as a tab if you don't know you can use uh you can simply drag the terminal to your editor and it can be opened as a tab which in my opinion is very very convenient let's come back to this page and let's copy this and install app right so npm install app right you can either use this terminal or you can even use this terminal okay anything is fine and let's copy this and let's import line from up right I'll show you when and where this is useful but let's copy this or even if you are not planning to copy this simply click next I've copied it and I'm going to create a file and let me use this page.js let's import everything here so import line from upright and let's copy this as well and let me do one thing I want to keep this Google Chrome opened in desktop 2 and I want to open this vs code in desktop one so I can do this to switch tabs okay let's copy this client is equal to new client and this is the endpoint and this is my project ID okay let's click next and after clicking next I'll say take me to the dashboard so I'm on my dashboard which shows me what bandwidth I'm using and how many requests are made Etc okay let's click on this next year's 13 web app and I can update the host name I can delete this platform and I can do whatever I want okay there are a bunch of different options and there is this API Keys tab as well I can create an API key and I can start working uh with my backend okay so these are all the functions that can be used with the upright Cloud but let me show you very basic function firstly we are going to create a database let's create a database I'm going to call this blog let's click on Create and let's create a collection inside of blog and let's name this collection is blog as well okay now I will click on documentation and this documentation will help me add documents to the database so if you want to add a document to the database all you need to do is simply copy this I'm going to copy this or rather this let's copy this and after pasting it here I'm going to copy my project ID database ID and collection ID I'll show you where to get the project ID database ID and collection ID from so let me click backspace and databases is equal to new database let me cut this import and paste it at the top and client database ID from map right let us go back and click collection ID to copy the collection ID The Collection ID is copied let's paste it here and also let's go back and click database ID to get the database ID and let's paste the database ID here so what basically we are doing is we are creating a new document inside of our block database okay so we have a Blog database and we have a collection called blog and we are adding some documents to this so let's create an attribute so attribute key can be anything let's call it title and let's make it string yes it is required the size let us say 34 and let's click create then I'm going to create another attribute and I am going to uh sorry I'm going to create an attribute so I'll click on attributes create attribute I'll say content and let's keep the content as string and yes it is required size is one two three three okay now I can create a document like this I can say title is say I am a title and then content is I am content okay now I can start my next GS app by simply running npm run Dev and our next year's app will start so I can click on localhost 3000 and this app will start as you can see this app has started and I can reload this page and if I show you my database documents let's reload and reloading did not add any document to this database let me see what is wrong here so we have the project ID we have the document ID everything now the problem is that the current user is not authorized to perform the requested action so let's see what the problem is and the problem is that if I go to settings I have not given permission to everyone for creating reading deleting on the database so let's create a role so I'm going to say any and let's give permission for read update create and delete ideally you will not do that but again I am doing this for demonstration purpose let's now try it out and let's try to restart the server npm run Dev and let us see how this looks like so let's reload this page and I'll show you whether the documents are coming in the database or not and yes they are so if I reload this once again I'll see yet another document and so on as you can see so there is another document and there are documents being added to our blog collection because we have directly written this here so we are now ready to add content to the database okay and this is the code for doing the same so in order to create a blog I am going to create a very simple application with no authentication I'm going to Simply create a page which will show the list of all the blocks and the second thing that I'm going to show you is the page which will contain a particular blog okay so let's try to refine things a bit I am going to Simply go back to my blog collection and let's add attributes to this block so we have title we have content let's add a slug as well slug is going to be string yes it will be required and the size is going to be say 50 or 60. let's click create and let's now comment this out I'm going to comment this out because I don't want a document to be added to the database whenever I am hitting the index page let's come back to this index page and let's try to write some code inside this index page I'm going to keep things very very simple I'm not going to focus much on UI at this point but on the home page I want all the blogs to be listed so I'm going to create a state so import use state from react and I'm going to create a state and use State snippet blog set blocks is equal to an empty array okay so I'm going to keep an empty array here and let's return a div and let's type hey I want to keep things very simple at this point let's see if things are working it says that you are importing uh you are importing a component that needs used it so by default all the components are server components in next year is 13 so we'll have to see use client okay and it should work now so hey is being shown here let's come back to our public folder no I want to see where the styles are inside my apps there is a file called global.cs I want to remove all these Styles except the Tillman CSS code and it will make my page as wide I'm now going to go to tailblocks.cc and inside tlblocks.cc I am going to copy a header so I'm going to copy I header very quickly and then I'll grab a code for footer as well so let's try to add header to this page ideally you will want to use a nav bar but let me keep it very quick and since I'm demonstrating app right here I'll paste this header here let's right click change all occurrences and let's change this to class name instead of class and let's also change all these stroke Dash and I want to make the first character after straw Dash as capital so let's select this and right click command palette transform to uppercase I'm doing this because the thing is that stroke dash line cap is not valid in react so I'll have to remove this Dash and make the character right after stroke Dash as uppercase and we'll get rid of all the errors you will see some errors if you are not doing this okay but since I am doing this I will not get any errors and if I get any errors I know how to solve them all right so we have tail blocks first link second link let's see if we have some template for uh showing the block content I am simply searching for some good template for the blog content okay this looks pretty good but let's see if we can find some something better this looks good as well but I'm simply searching for something better okay so this is this is looking even better to me let's keep this on hold and let's see if we find something better than okay so this this is finals this is something that I really like let's let's turn on the word wrap view word wrap okay and after head I want to add this section and let's fix this HTML to react thing we'll have to add these slashes in order for this to work and now let's see if this is added to our app or not yes our app looks pretty good but instead of this I want to write the name of my blog let us say the name of the block is the coding Thunder and let's go to charge gbt and generate something chart GPT to the rescue and let's say generate meta description for a Blog titled the Turning sorry the coding handle okay it will generate something for me and I'm going to copy this and paste it to my app okay and yes this looks pretty good let's let's use this card as a template and let's see if we can somehow fix this so we have a single card at this point and I want to map through the blogs blogs dot map and title blogs.map and item and let's cut this and let's return this and item dot content and then item dot title and I think this should look good but again I want to do one more thing I want to make sure that blocks are populated so how do we make sure that the blocks are populated let's cut this and let's put it inside use effect snippet this is a use select snippet and I want this to run whenever this page is loaded and let's uncomment this out so we are creating a new client then I'm going to do client dot set endpoint and client dot set project let's also keep this outside the home function then we have the database then we have create document instead of doing create document I want to make sure that I promise is equal to databases dot I want to list documents list documents and let's see if we can do something so we need database ID collection ID and then query so let's add these two values and I think we should be good here yeah that should be fine let's see if let's see if we are getting this on the console so let's reload this page and let's see if we are getting this response on the console and let's see what we get on the console so it says console.log expected comma is there some issue here let me see if there is an issue here so let's reload this page and let's see if there is anything wrong here so invalid Dom property class name will fix this we'll fix this in a while and then it says can't resolve encoding okay and let's see if we are getting the result in the console or not okay we are getting this result on the console so there are some documents which we can see on the console so let's do one thing let's say that blocks is equal to response dot document so set blogs response dot documents and let's see whether we are able to see our blocks or not so yes we are able to see the blog so I am content I am content I am content let's see if we are able to add some more content and if we are able to add some more content it should be visible here so let's go back to uh app right and let's see if you are able to add some documents and uh see them here so create document I'll say enter to JavaScript and then hey this is intro to JavaScript intro to JS and let's say create and let's reload and yes we can see the central to JavaScript document here I want to make sure that the content of this page is not fully displayed here so I'll say dot sub s t r 0 to 12. so that only a part of so that only a part of this content is visible here and then we'll see we'll say some triple dots like this and this looks pretty good we can also set an image an image link or something but let's keep it for later let's now go to the internet and search for random image API random image API let's see if we can get a random image SRC is equal to random Dot imagecdn.app let's see if we can replace this with the random image we couldn't find that photo not sure why it shows this but a simple API for serving random images I think it doesn't work cdn.app let's see I'm just trying to make it work okay so images.unsplash.com this is how it is going to work let's give it a height of 23 and width of 23 generate link Okay so this is something that we can use I'm just trying to make it work let's see if it works okay so it does work but it shows the same image and how about this how about this now I will add an attribute called image let me choose attribute type as a URL and as you can see I have restarted my vs code I am going to run my server once again oops I ran the wrong command no worries I meant to run npm run Dev run Dev and let's run the development server to see how things have changed so image is an attribute and let's add image attribute to some of the documents so image is a URL so let's add URL to some image URL to images images royalty free let's see if we can get links to the images somehow let me try this one I want to keep things really very simple which is why I'm going for very simple images but ideally for your production projects you are going to go for the real images Okay so let's see if this image has a URL yes it does so let's add this and update it says invalid document structure missing required attributes log okay so let me change this to title and it's update image and let's see if we reload this whether image is pulled from the database or not it does it it is pulled from the database which means that we are able to change a document so app writes cloud.abrite dot IO dashboard can be used as a backend if you don't have a dashboard but again ideally for a bigger app you will want to have an app which has a dashboard but you can always update data from here you can update permissions from here which is an amazing feature in my opinion so let's also give this one a slug and let's give it some different image I want to change the image this time so I'll say copy image address and I will update the image address let me go back and let me do the same for other documents as well so let's grab some other image links and let's give it some random slug I know these slugs they don't look very good but ideally for your apps you are going to have very meaningful slugs so copy image address again and let's paste it here and let's call this slug 4 or something okay and let's let me use the same image for this one as well introduce Js and see it takes effect immediately so all the images are updated and this blog looks pretty good so let's change this tail blocks to coding Thunder coding Thunder Thunder and this will change to coding Thunder also you can change these links like home about us or something so you can say home and then you can say about us and then you can say contact us and so on so this is something that you can always do okay and let's say uh blog and let me keep blog above contact us and let me get rid of this button I don't know why I don't like this button okay and as you can see your navigation bar looks pretty good is there anything else that we can make to we can do to make it more better in terms of functionality the answer is yes so I'll say import link from next link now what this next link will do is instead of these anchor tags we'll use Link and we'll use hrf is equal to let us say slash and let's also change the closing tag to link okay and let's change this to about and then blog and then contact and you can create these Pages such that you can access these links so in order to create these Pages all you need to do is create folders say if I create a folder called about and if I add a react server component and the moment I click on about I'll come to this page now you can always edit and work on this page but at this point I'm not working on this page rather I'm going to work on another page which is blog post okay so right inside app folder I will create a folder called blog post and inside this blog post I will say page.js and in order to help myself with how to create a dynamic page I'll say next dot js13 Dynamic roots and I'll come to the documentation of dynamic road so since I'm using the app router not Pages router I'll change it to app router and as you can see here that I can say app slash blog Slash Slug slash ph.js so this is something that you can always do in order to get the slug so they have used the same example so inside of the blog post I will have to create yet another folder called slug and inside this slug folder I'll create this page.js and inside this page.js I can always get these values so let me see how this is going to work okay so blocks log page dot Js and these params will hold these values I guess so let's say RF refce and let's use params and let's see if params contain anything params and let's do Json dot stringify buttons and let's see what prints on the screen okay so let's let's say slash blog post slash p and I want to see if this blog post Slash Slug works or not it doesn't work for some reason okay so I misspelled blog post slug p is written here which is amazing so I can get the slug by params.slug so cons slug is equal to params dot slug and I need not do this let me open a fragment and inside of this fragment I can have the nav bar as well as a page content so let me copy this header as is ideally you will create a component for this Adder but since this is a very basic app I'm just demonstrating You by copy pasting and with a warning that you must create a component if you are trying to create header okay all right so we have this header and then I will go to tailblogs.cc tail blogs.cc okay so it says link is not defined so import link from next link this should work okay coding Thunder the nav bar is here and how should I structure my blog post is something that I am figuring out what if I show the heading here and then the content below the setting something of that sort right so without thinking much about it I'm going to copy this I'm going to Simply copy this code copy to clipboard and I'm going to paste this section and at the same time I want to remove these uh get it on Google Play and these things let me see how it looks so it looks like this and download on Play Store button SVG span so let me get rid of this Dev let's get rid of this Dev and see how it looks okay so this is going to be the title of my page and let me also see if I do lorem 23 how it looks so it's going to look like this I think this is an amazing setup for a Blog and I'm very happy with how it looks so let's do one thing let's try to pull the blog by slug from upright so I'm going to use the same Imports so let's try to use the same Imports and let's create this as a client component oops I accidentally closed it no worries and then I'm going to instead of blocks I'll say blog so I need to pull one block the first block so set blog is equal to use State and blog is going to be an object an empty object okay and inside yields effect we want to make sure that we are pulling we are pulling only the block that we need Okay so let's copy this use effect and let's tweak it let's tweak this user fact code so let me get rid of this so instead of document databases dot list documents I want to give it a filter I think I can give it a query filter and say slug should be slug and let's see what the response is so response is a lock to the console let's reload it and also I need to make sure that this is a client component so you'll have to add this use client at the top and let's see what it has to say in the console so there are some errors its client is not defined okay so client is not defined it's a very genuine error because I have not defined the client and now it should work all right so let's see what's there in the console it says 400 let me see what's wrong here 400 databases queries is equal to object plus object so this is the slug and list documents list documents let's see what are the parameters that we can provide to list documents so database ID string collection ID string and data is so we'll have to define the query like this so query is used by typing query dot equals so let's try to copy this and let's also import query from app right so we are going to import query as well so we imported query and this is not how we provide the query rather we provide the slug like this so let's make it little bigger and let's say Slug and Slug and let's see if this works okay and it says value must be a valid array and value must be a valid string and no longer there four zero nine six characters okay and the query should be an array like this so let's provide an array of queries instead of just a query so let's provide an array to this and it says index not found slug index.phone slug okay so index not found because this uh slug is not valid so let me call this title and let's see if it is able to pull something index not found slug so slug is title here and it should pull this document from the database um let's see what's wrong here so in order for this to work we'll have to create an index so let's come back to our collection and let's come back to indices and let's create an index and index type is key and the attribute we want to create index on a slug and order is ascending let's create this index and this index is successfully created and now if I reload it works so you can say total zero documents array 0 so there is no document which was pulled which is something that we'll have to look into but again this works this works at this point so slug is not equal to this params.slug value we'll have to see what is wrong here so let me try this first Slug and slug 4 and yes one document is pulled from the database so all we need is we will have to get the first document so we'll see dot documents zero so we are we are going to set the blog as response dot documents zero which is going to be your blog and then this will be block dot content blog dot content and this is going to be um and let me say block question mark dot content so that we don't get any error if blog is not defined and let's also say block dot title and let's call this as the coding Thunder okay so yes the blog is pulled from the database so if I say I am a title I am a Content this content is visible which is amazing so instead of going to the blog we'll have to go to the home page and all the blogs are visible and I will do one thing I will change the links to the valid links let me show you what this means so whenever somebody clicks on the title or on this card I'm going to add a link so let me add a link and let me say link href is equal to let's cut this and let's let's say slash blog post slash and we are going to add the slug so we'll say Plus item dot Slug and I think this should work okay so whenever I click on this title I should go to this page yes it is showing me the blog content and all of these block contents they look very basic they don't look like realistic block content but let me add a realistic blog content as well so let's let's add a blog post which actually makes sense so let's try to go to intro to JS in one blog and I don't know whose blog this is but this is whatever I'm doing is for learning purposes and it's on my local so I'm not copying anybody's blog uh let's add this title and I'm going to add the content as well so let me add this content as well and I know it is not going to be as structured as this one because I'm not using HTML or markdown or something but I pasted the content here and I'm going to give these slug as intro to Js and blog let me add blog and let's also add an image I'm going to copy this image so let's right click and I'm not able to copy this image what is it URL of this image so looks like the uploader doesn't want me to access this image but sorry developer I will anyway access your image next document security is disabled so I just clicked on Create and this blog is created so let's reload this page and let's see if we are able to access this blog or not now if you change this to mark down and if you allow more characters you can structure the blog however you want and you can also have comments and you can in a very similar way use user authentication of web right to power your blog so I hope that you like this video and now you are capable of creating a Blog using app right in a very similar way you can create your backend using app right and connect it with your Android app or anything of your choice so I think this is a great choice when it comes to creating quick blogs production applications or even apps or if you want to have everything connected to one backend and this is very useful when you want to have everything connected to a single backend like your app do the same backend and your web app to the same app right back end and so on so I hope you love this video and you will explore different ways to create different applications using upright thank you so much guys for watching this video and I will see you next time [Music] foreign [Music]
Zcspn-B3V-E,react.dav is one of the best ways to learn react online they have revamped the react documentation and the new documentation is more concise up to date and I really love the way content is structured there the old class components are now replaced with functional components when you start learning via this was one of the biggest thing that react needed to change in their docs and they did go check out react.dev and let me know how the newer VR documentation looks to you
ZxQ5ERe43YE,if I were to give you only one tip to learn programming what would it be instead of focusing on multiple languages multiple Frameworks multiple things I want you to focus on just one thing and master it so that you can take something out of it if you learn basics of three different things and you are not able to use those three things it's useless people these days want to learn different things they want to learn machine learning they want to learn artificial intelligence web development front-end development Android development they want to keep all these things under their belt in as much as time as possible it is not going to be practical instead of learning a lot of things if you keep your focus on one single thing and once you have mastered that particular skill and you are able to make money from that skill you are able to build stop using that one thing you can always learn different topics and explore different other things I wish you all the best in your endeavors
PBqwAJgrw3k,the best to-do's list app is here I know you have used a lot of to-do's list apps you might have used Microsoft to-dos you might have used Google keep there are tons of apps but do you know which is the best out of all these apps in my opinion it's a pen and a people I have always used a pen and a paper and when you keep a pen and a paper on the table it'll be very convenient for you to follow what you have written I always recommend you use a pen and a paper for important tasks but going digital is also not a bad thing but if I were to compare these to those apps a pen and a paper is the best
S5uLkxNUk-M,in this video we are going to create a dictionary app using HTML CSS and JavaScript and we are going to use Rapid API extension and Rapid API to create this let's move on our computer screen and let's see how these things are created and let's get started so now I inside of my vs code and what I'm going to do is I I'm going to open my Chrome browser and here is an API called dictionary by API ninja so if you go to Rapid API and sign up for an API you can actually search for an API so you can search for an API in the search bar so what I'm doing is I'm typing word dictionary and this will actually pull all the apis related to this keyword and as you can see that word dictionary is an API dictionary by API ninjas is an API this is something that you can use this is something you can use as well so let me open this dictionary by API ninjas and what this is doing is basically it can uh help you get meaning of a word using AXS fetch or whatever you like okay now what I'm going to do is I'm going to create a folder in vs code so I'm going to create a folder uh called dictionary pwh and I'm going to drag this folder to vs code so I'm basically dragging this folder to vs code and I want you to install two extensions in vs code the first one being the rapid API which is from Rapid API itself it's a rapid API client extension basically you can test your um apis using this extension install this and you're going to love it trust me okay now uh another one is live server this is something that you need to install as well this is also amazing uh and it basically helps you get the um you know output preview of your HTML files and you can actually you know see the live preview without having to reload the page so we are going to use this for sure let me create a new file called index.html here no rocket science so far so far okay uh it's really very cold guys so if I'm typing slow that is the reason okay get bootstrap.css permanent so I always use bootstrap I don't know why the reason is actually I know the reason is that not a lot of people are very comfortable with with CSS and if you are teaching something which is not CSS for example here I want to teach you how to use apis I want to write some JavaScript code I don't want to focus on front end so what I'll do is I'll actually use something which doesn't consume a lot of your attention uh from front end point of view okay so what I'll do is I'll use this bootstrap so the very first thing that I'm going to do is I'm going to grab this uh quick start template from bootstrap and let me simply paste it here and let me right click and open this with live server so bootstrap is working and it's very easy to make bootstrap work no rocket science there and I'm not pretending that I've done something which is great so far okay now what I'm going to do is I'm going to grab a nav bar a very easy way to grab a nav bar is to copy it from here and paste it here now this is something which is permanent on CW and BW as well we always use bootst you always use this now bar because it is easy to use okay let me change the title to Dictionary app because I want to I want to feel the CL Dictionary app while I'm using this app let me also copy this and let me paste it here and you'll see that I I without having to reload the page you'll see the title of the page here okay which is great now what I'll do is I'll simply type something here and I want the meaning of that word here okay so what I'll do is I'll create a very simple layout in fact what I'll do is I'll grab a layout from the examples what could be the best way to to get the um you know meaning of a word uh I think this is something which is great so what I'll do is I'll simply right click and inspect and let me copy this entire thing with with the heading with the image let me see if I can do that uh so what I'll do is oh let me do one thing guys let me no no no I don't want to grab the entire main uh because that will complicate the things for me so what I'll do is I'll say edit HTML and I already have the bootstrap in installed so here inside of this div I'm pasting this div and you'll see that centered hero is something that I've grabbed automatically this is like you know uh very easy to do now I I'll show you something I'll show you something so you can actually use bootstrap icons okay I don't know if I'm uh going out of context here but bootstrap icons is an amazing way to grap some of the very nice icon from the internet I don't know if you can directly download them um but uh I I'll see if I can download the book icon you know somehow so this is the d uh icons I think these are all the icons let me see if they have book oh yes they do they do have books um let me see if I can download it open image in new tab can I reference to this let me see if I can do that uh what I'll do is I'll simply replace this SRC with this one I should be able to use the GitHub server let me see where is my app here is my app oh wow this is actually looking great so all I need to do now is I type a Word here I'll click search and upon clicking search after typing a word I want to see the meaning of that word here okay uh so I I'll change the content of these two buttons uh talk to author contribute so these are the two buttons two dummy buttons which I'm creating for this app and uh guys it's really very cold here I I'm going out of context but I'm doing this sorry about that okay I don't want to waste a lot of time doing this so I'll continue so what I'm doing is I'm adding these two buttons and I'm adding these two buttons so that you know uh the app looks good okay now what I'll do is I'll simply grab the Windows key on my keyboard actually I'm using a Windows keyboard on a Mac uh I don't know if if that's normal but I do that because I have a Windows machine and you know I have to switch from Windows to Mac I have a keyboard and I love this keyboard it's uh I'm again going out of context it's from Red Gear uh mechanical keyboard really nice not sponsored by the way okay so let me mouse is from Logitech it's also good uh let me now do something let me now come back to vs code and let me create a script called script.js and inside of this script.js what I'll say is I'll say hey if somebody clicks this button which button this search button okay so I'll say uh ID is equal to search I'll say hey if somebody clicks on the search button all you have to do is you have to grab the text from this input so I'll simply say ID is equal to search input so I have a search input here and I have uh another element with ID search let me call it search ptn you know it'll be easy for me to remember what this is otherwise if I simply say search I'll forget that it's a button and it's not an input Okay cool so far so good now what I want to do is I want to actually you know I want to see if this API works so what I'm going to do is I'm going to test this API right into the rapid API extension so let me do one thing let me simply take this URL so this is a dictionary and I'll give it a parameter which is word okay so let me um let me say new request let me put the URL here so it's a get request I'll say dictionary dictionary app by API ninja so API ninja is the provider in Rapid API so in Rapid API you have a lot of providers who are providing the API to you uh I'm using rapid apis API ninja okay so thank you API Ninja for the API so query in place of query what I'll do is I'll say word and I'll say abandon I I'll see the meaning of this word but let me add the headers first so I'll copy this key I'll you know paste my key then I'll paste the host so these are the two headers which I'll have to copy and paste how do I know that because that's something which I'm seeing in this XS code you can actually change this code if you want you know if you don't understand JavaScript and XCS you can actually change this to some other language so uh if you want to change it to lipc URL code you can do that okay so you can always do that okay now what I'm going to do is I'm going to keep JavaScript fetch because I'm going to use fetch I can actually copy this code right from I don't even have to test it but in case you are using a third- party API provider which is not providing you a means to test the API you can actually test it here so you can see that to cast or drive out to banish to expel to reject so this is something uh API ninja has returned and I love it I can actually show the definition here so all I'll do is I'll say hey um let me write a function and I'll say um the name of the word is dictionary and I'm going to write an arrow function I'm going to say hey if somebody gives me a word okay if somebody gives me a word and uh if if I need the meaning of that word what I'll do is I'll call this API and I'll actually convert this then to a proper function um and inside of this function I'll write the logic so I'll actually get the response in the console and I can do whatever I want here so I can say search uh BTN or rather search uh or or let me call it word do inner HTML is equal to response Dot and we have the word response. word so what I'm basically doing is I'm saying that uh inside of span with ID word what you'll have to do is insert this text okay so let me create a span with ID word so this is where I want my word to be so I'll say span and I'll say ID is equal to word okay and here what I'll do is let me toggle word wrap yes uh here what I want is I want the definition so I'll say span ID is equal to definition okay so uh word. HTML is equal to this and definition do HTML is equal to response. definition which means this thing and the moment somebody searches uh what I want to do is I want to say hey uh if somebody clicks on submit BTN I want to add an event listener and I want to add a click listener and what I want to do is I want to say hey if somebody clicks on this button all you have to do is e do prevent default now what is e do prevent default so basically when somebody clicks on the button and it's inside of a form that form will be submitted I don't want that I don't want page to reload and form to submit I want to suppress the default Behavior okay so this is what e do prevent default does after this what I'm going to do is I'm going to say hey if somebody clicks on this button do one thing grab the value of this input and call the dictionary function so I'll say dictionary and searge input. Val so grab the value of the search input and execute this stationary method okay uh and by default what I'll do is word your word will appear here and in place of definition I'll say welcome to the dictionary app type your favorite word in the search bar at the top search bar at the top and you will see the meanings here okay you will see the meanings here which is great okay so let me see if the app works your word will appear here welcome to the dictionary app type your favorite word in the search bar at the top at the top left left sorry top right at the top right and you will see the meaning of that word here you'll see the meaning of that word here you'll see the meaning of that word here let me try so I'll say abandon uh it didn't work there is some error or something let me see what the issue is so I think I forgot to add this script so what I'll do is I'll say script script is script SRC is equal to script.js and submit BTN is not defined submit BTN where are you search bdn sorry not submit bdn so search bdn it's called search bdn not submit bdan uh so if I say abandon so if I search for abandon let me see if this works it doesn't work it doesn't changes this and C bright let me see if the word is bright no it's it's actually taking the wrong word so what I'll do is I will see why is it taking bright the reason is that we have hardcoded bright so what I'll do is I will say word here so whatever is coming will appear here and word do inner HTML is equal to response. word so the span with ID is equal to word is not changing so this is something that I need to fix so your your word will appear here so why is ID is equal to word not working so word do inner HTML is equal to response. word let me see why the word is not changing so if I say abandon the meaning of abandon will come but this word is not changing so to cast or driver to banish to expel this is this is this thing okay cool nice now uh why is this word not taking this place let me see let me type word here so this is correct if I say word do inner HTML is equal to response. word sorry if I say hey it changes to hey but why is it not working here so if I say word do inner HTML is equal to response. word why is the word not changing let me see what's the issue here so word your word will appear here span ID is equal to word not sure man what's happening but I will find out the bug so the meaning is changing but this is not changing what's wrong here what am I doing wrong here so w r d w r d meaning is correct everything is correct this this thing is actually you know it's it's actually freaking me out let me do console.log word and response and let me remove this response from here let me see if the word is available or not while I'm typing something so if I type abandon so abandon is here but why is this thing not showing up this word okay I got it I got it so I'm what I'm doing is the mistake is that I'm using the same word here but I'm I should actually use some other ID so I'll say a word heading okay let me call it word heading instead of word and no need to do console log I'm pretty confident that this is going to work okay so word heading. HTML is equal to response. what now if I do something like this what I'll do is I'll save water let me see what the meaning of water so if I search the fluid which descends from the clouds in Rain what a nice definition and also I want to format the output nicely so how do I do it so the first second and third uh so what I'll do is I'll say hey if there is one dot in your word response. word I'll say do replace replace one dot with uh back sln word dot sorry one dot back back slash and it's actually a forward slash not back slash okay and I want to do this with two Dot and three dot okay let me copy this let me paste it here 1 dot 2 Dot 3 Dot 4 dot let me also do the same thing with four dot and we'll see if this works or not so if I say abandon this will actually change okay so I I don't want uh back sln I want uh BR because this is HTML br will work in HTML so if I say abandon if I say search uh okay so BR doesn't work why let me find out so if I do uh response. word do oh I'm doing it with word I need to do it with the definition so this is a mistake let me fix my mistake this should work now if I say abandon and if I search this is actually showing all the meanings in new lines nice nice and clean this looks pretty pretty good okay uh meaning of your word will appear here I'll say meaning of if I do something like this this is actually not looking good so let me change it to here is the meaning of plus response. word and let me enclose this in double quotes So I searched here's a meaning of water and let me also put a space here so abandon let me also see the meaning of um let me see the meaning of uh pressure so here's the meaning of pressure let me see the meaning of um what is specs this is the meaning of specs it's not available is specification let me see if the meaning of specification is available it is available so this is the meaning and word which is being displayed here you can always beautify this or you can always show the first meaning it's up to you guys you can you can do whatever you want if you know JavaScript you you can do literally whatever you want I can actually go to index.html and make it the Nar a pretty more beautiful so I can remove this Li let me remove this Li let me change it to about this this app and you can even change the HFS you can remove this disabled link and yes this works now and this is looking pretty good so I hope that you like this Dictionary app if you have any questions let me know in the comments and um it's pretty cold here so let me remove this I look good uh This Way U thank you so much guys for watching this video and I will see you next time [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]
jaq1KWi2_DU,in this video I'm going to show you how to use one entry CMS and make the most out of it I'm going to go ahead and download a template from theme forest and we are going to see how to use that theme forest template along with one entry CMS to get the best out of it let's move on to our computer screen let's get started all right so guys I'm inside of my computer screen and the very first step that we are going to do is signing up on one entry so all you have to do is click on the sign up I'll give you a link in the description and if you follow that link you are going to get a discount as well so you can put your name you can then put your email address and then you can put your phone number and then you can agree to both of these and once you sign up you will get a code in your phone so you have to pick up the phone and punch in the code whatever the code is and then your account will be created after your account is created you have to click on projects and create a new project and then you can give it a name give it a subdomain and you can put in a promo code that will be in the description if you are new to one entry you are going to get this promo code and if you use this promo code you are going to get one entry project for free this is only applicable for first project so you can use it and once you click on create your project will start creating now project creation takes some time so we are going to go to theme forest and we are going to look for a template let me look for a template theme forest portfolio template and I'm going to show you how to use theme forest template with one entry so there are a lot of templates uh I'm going to pick one and I'm going to buy that template you can always try this with free template if you want but I'm going to find some premium template and I'm going to buy that template and I'm going to use one entry with that template now this is a template that I really like this is basically a portfolio react template and uh it is an xgs template and you can see that there are a lot of designs that are already built you can download the CV and then about me looks pretty good to me plus this template is responsive let me show you this is responsive and I like this hamburger animation so I'm going to buy this now you might say that why are we buying templates we are ourself web developers see the thing is that we are buying template because we are going to focus on a bigger problem um and let's focus on that bigger problem which is managing backend and that problem is also going of solved when we have one entry so let's see if our one entry project has finished it is still creating this project so it kind of takes 7 minutes so we are going to wait for it and in the meantime I'm going to buy this template so let's buy this template I'll click on buy now all right so clicking on buy now and I'm going to punch in all the details and then I'm going to create my account and then I'm going to continue so let's do one thing let's continue with Google I'm going to continue with Google continue and I'm going to wait and I'm going to provide all the details to it and after providing all the details details I'm be I'll be back now it is asking for my credit card details I'm going to punch in all the details and uh then I'll be back so as you can see that this template is available I can download this template and I can download all files and documentation so let's download this and it has zipped it and it is downloading all the files so this is the template that uh I have received let's do one thing let's open this template this is a template that I've received I'll right click on this and I'm going to extract all so let's extract everything from this template and once everything is extracted yeah so it has extracted inside a folder and there are two folders here one is Adena one is documentation let's open the documentation and see how to get started so let's do one thing let's try it out ourselves so I'm going to open this in vs code and let's do Yan Dev Yan Dev and Yan install Yan and after Yan install I'm going to run Yan Dev and now let's do Yan Dev and let's see if it is working or not so yeah this template is working uh let me click here and yes this is working download CV is working this sample.pdf is downloading amazing so this template is working working pretty fine now we are going to see how we can integrate one entry uh inside this okay so there are a lot of pages that we can manage as per our choice so I'm going to delete some pages and I'm going to keep some pages let's do one thing uh let's come back to this one entry our project is ready let's click here and I'm going to show you how to do it using npms so now I'm going to adjust this template so that we can use one entry with it the very first thing that I'm going to is I'll go to pages and I will show you how it looks like and after that I'll do yarn Dev and uh this is how this template looks like at this point I'm going to select one version of this template which is home horizontal and I will split all these menus into different pages at this point when you click on about it Scrolls down and when you click on service it Scrolls down same goes for portfolio and testimonial as well but I'm going to make sure that this opens on different pages so let's create all those pages is so this is basically how my website now looks like I have this homepage about page and contact page my template had a lot of pages but these are the pages that I picked up so that I can explain you one entry and we can build a beautiful website using one entry so let's understand everything one by one let's start from pages so inside of pages I have two pages here I have created a homepage and I've created an about page this is the homepage that I want to populate let me go to home and this is the homepage and let us say this is the content content that I want to populate so let's call it introduction I'll call this introduction and I'll go to pages and once you have created a homepage in one entry you can click on edit and now you can attach an attribute to this page I'll show you how that works so we'll go to attributes and we can create an attribute so we'll say that I want to create attribute and I'll call it intro homecore intro and marker is going to be homecore intro and this is going to be for pages and let's create it and once I create it I'll click on settings and I'll say the attribute name is homeor intro and the value of the attribute is hello I am it's it's going to be string first of all and I'll create it let's say homecore intro I'll say hi which stands for homecore intro and once I have this attribute I'm going to fill it so let's refresh and we are going to fill this attributes so now if I come back to pages I have this home intro attribute and I'm going to fill the value of this as hello I am rockers Nelson okay so this is what I have saved now we'll come back to our CMS page where we have already logged in we'll come to settings and we'll click on app tokens and we are going to get one app token so let's copy this app token and we are going to install one entry package so we'll say and Yan add one entry and also while I'm installing one entry um it is done great so let's run Yan Dev once again Yar Dev once again and I'll wait for all these pages to load and yes everything is working fine you can also have this picture as a link if you want to add an attribute where this picture is a link you can do that as well I'll show you how I can populate this I am rockers Nelson I'll come back to one entry documentation I'll click on npm I'll click on installation we have done that we'll click on usage now and this is what I'm interested in so I'll come back to my homepage which is index.js and I'll say server site props so we are going to write a function which is server s side props and no we are not going to comment it out we are going to write it so let's say server site props is a function and yes we are going to return the props and what are those props I'm going to tell you what those props are but before that we are going to copy the URL and we are going to populate our URL so let's populate our URL this is how you can populate the URL awesome and I'm going to paste my token here so I just got the token and my token was copied to the clipboard and then inside this Lang code I'm going to say enus and I'll extract out pages from it because I want pages and I'll say a wait con pages is equal to pages doget I think pages doget is the method but we'll see the documentation it's called pages. getet root Pages this is this is what I'm interested in so I'll say pages. get root Pages await pages. get root pages and we are going to pass in the pages so we'll say pages so p can be received as a prop here and once again we can pass pages to our hero section so pages and uh let's open hero and let's accept Pages here and uh just like we had this hero content here we'll say um I am Pages Dot and we'll find the attribute so let's do one thing let's say use effect and let's write uh console.log pages and we are going to Simply complete this uh use effect all right so let's see if we are able to get the pages here it says Define one entry is not defined we'll have to import it that's not a problem and yes we can Define one entry from one entry this should work now Define one entry is now working and just so that you can see I'll pull it and as you can see we have an array where we have two pages Pages uh let me move myself here and as you can see we have two pages the very first page is the homepage the second page is the about page we can create contact page as well but for now we have um this page and about page and where are the page attributes by the way so if you want to see the attribute values this is the attribute value so you'll say I want the attribute values and I want to extract out high from it and I want to extract out the value so let's do one thing we'll say okay Pages zero um so instead of saying hello I am hero content. name I'm going to say this is Pages zero and then we need attribute values and we need uh zero do value let's see if this is correct so attribute values then we need high from the attribute values and then we need this um value okay so I'll say do high do high value and let's say let's see if this is being populated or not and as you can see this is being populated now this is coming from the CMS it's not coming uh it's not hardcoded or it's not coming from my um source code it's coming from the CM CMS and I'll show you why it is coming from CMS if you go to pages and if I click here and if I go back to the attributes so page attributes if I say hello I am Harry and if I update it and if I reload my page you'll see that this will be changed to I am hello I am Harry so I'm waiting for it to change as you can see it has changed to hello I am Harry which means it was not coming from the source code directly rather it was coming from the CMS so we can pull the content and we can populate the content same thing can be done here we can have some other attribute values we can create another attribute which will be called description so you can go to settings and you can say I want to create another attribute and this is DEC and this is being created for pages and then again you'll edit this so for Pages we have a DEC attribute as well and we'll say DEC marker also DEC and this will be a string let's create it and now if you go to pages and if you go to this attributes you can actually populate it so we'll say DEC and I will put this description and in place of this description hero cont do description I'll say I don't want description rather I'll say Pages 0. attribute values. dec. values so if I reload this page I hope that this works attribute values. high. Val it says what does it say it says canot read properties of undefined reading values let's see how the page is working all right so let's do one thing we'll say question mark dot do attribute values question mark dot so that if it is is not there it will be undefined and in the meantime we are going to debug what the problem is so this is how our pages are coming if we go to attribute values uh there is a DEC and then another attribute value is high so there should be two attribute values actually so uh on this page we just have a DEC and there is no high we will actually have to add DEC here so we are going to add Dees here value is going to be do you want to use it yes we still want to use it and value is going to be string let's save it and after it is saved we'll go back to our page we'll click add it and we'll come back to attributes and DEC will have a value home intro has this and DEC uh so let's punch in the values here so the value here will be this and the value here is going to be um hello I am Ro rockers Nelson and this should work now so the market here is high Market here is DEC now if I come back here uh you'll see that this high as well as the dec will be populated so if I refresh here you'll see that we have attribute values high and we have attribute values DEC and both the values are populated so you will see hi I am rocker Nelson and also you'll see this now I'll change this and show it to you that it is being changed so I'll say I am Harry Nelson and I'll say I am a Dev instead of saying I am a freelancer i I'll say I am a Dev so it's still saving let's wait for it to save it has saved so I'll say I am Dev and I'll click somewhere outside so that it can save it now if I refresh you'll see that this content is coming from my one entry CMS so it's saying I am a Dev front end react developer based in USA now we can do the same thing with about we can do the same thing with contact and our pages will function the way they should okay now if you have a lot of pages you can create a dynamic route in nextjs and you can pull p dynamically but I was showing this just for demonstration you can complete your website in a very similar way so we just saw that how attributes work now we are going to see how menus work so let us say I want to show a menu I'll call it footer menu footer unor menu and I'll give it a marker of FM so that I can easily get it in my code so I can use FM to get it in my code I'll click on ADD and this menu has been added now I can click here and I can add some pages to my footer menu so let us I want to add this home and I want to add this about to my footer menu and both of these pages are added to my menu I'll say show the menu so that all these men uh all these pages will be shown uh inside this menu I'll come back to my CMS page and I'll click on menus and this is how you can get menus so let's get the menu so I'll come back to index and I'll say menu and let's pull menus from one entry as well and I'll say con value is equal to get menus by marker we already have a FM marker inside our inside of one entry CMS and let's console log value as value okay let me double check the name of the marker is FM here we have FM now let's refresh and we should see the menu so it says menu is not defined what's wrong what's wrong okay so instead of menu we should say value we'll reload and I am expecting to see a menu here which I am not seeing okay so this will be shown in the server s side because get server s side props run on server site so we'll have to check here and as you can see that we have this menu this is titled as footer menu and we can display this menu uh if you want to see the value here you can always see that but I think the best use case of uh using this menu would be inside app.js so uh we can either do it here or we can also uh pass this data to a component so that it can display the data of the menu so what you'll do is you'll go to your footer and you will populate your footer with this menu and then you can dynamically change the content and title of this menu so this is how menus work in one entry all right so now that we have learned about menus let's Implement one so I'm going to come to comp components and I'm going to create a new component called footer so let's call it footer. jsx I'm going to write rafc and let us say uh we have some styles on this footer and let's say height is going to be 34 pixels and color is going to be white and let's say uh we have um background color is equal to this one um and also let's do text line set enter uh as my Lama co-pilot is suggesting and let's say copyright All Rights Reserved okay and let's come back to index.js and I'm going to say um I I want to add footer as well so let's add a footer and let's import a footer so I'll say import footer from components footer and this is how the footer looks like copyright All Rights Reserved now let us say that I want to show a menu in my footer wherein we have Facebook and Twitter and all the other social URLs okay so let's say this is called a menu prop and I'm going to say I want to pass the menu prop and I'm I'll say menu is equal to I'll say menu is equal to meu is equal to menus. get menus by marker and I'm going to give this as social marker okay so the marker name is social I'll come back to menu and I'm going to create a new menu so I'll say name is social and marker is also social okay so the marker is social name is social let's create this menu and after I create this menu I'm going to open this menu so let's open this menu social and if you want to add some pages to this menu you can simply do this so I'm adding home to the menu and I'm adding about to the menu uh for a while let's assume that these are social Pages or let's say these are all the pages that exist in our CMS okay and after I've done this I will simply see how this menu looks like so if I say console.log menu and if I see how it looks like just a moment uh let's reload this page so it says menu is not defined let me fix this menu is not defined menu is equal to this console.log menus okay so let's reload this and I guess it's going to work after we reload yes it is working and let's see if we have all the menus at place or not so as you can see that this social menu has all the page URL so you can see that this has page URL as home this has page URL is about so we'll simply pass this menu to footer so we'll say menu is equal to menu and we are going to Simply map over this menu and we'll say ul and then we'll say menu do map and let's accept menu from the props so we are going to accept the menu from the props and then we'll say menu do map and after we say menu. map we are going to do this and item Dot Page URL this is what I want so page URL is uh what I want okay so key is Page URL and we are going to show the page URL and let's see how it looks like so menu. map is not a function okay so menu do map is not a function let me see what is wrong here so what I've done here is I feted the menu and I've passed menu. Pages as props and as you can see um we have passed this menu to the footer and finally we are basically returning we are saying a return Li and this is what we are returning and this should be visible here so it is not being visible here let me see what the problem is let's remove all these stylings and and instead of doing these stylings we can simply return this UL as is so I'll show you how it looks like we can definitely make it better by styling but this is how it looks like if we remove the Styles so I've styled it a bit and this is how it looks like you can always convert it to uppercase if you want so you can do something like uh styles do menu item dot uh sorry uh item. page url. to uppercase and this is how it is going to look like uh after you have converted it to uppercase so two uppercase is not a function so if I have a string to uppercase Okay C is capital let me fix it and this is how it's going to look like and you can always say hrf is equal to you can import link from next link so I can say import link from next link and I can add an HF HF is equal to and it's going to be item. p URL okay and this is how you can show a menu now our menu is really very simple but you can always show the menu as you want now our menu is really simple but you can always add styles of your liking in your menu so this is how it looks like so you can have this menu here you can always style it the way you want so this is how menus work in one entry now I'll come back to forms and we'll see how we can see forms in one entry so in order to see how forms work in one entry you can and create a form so I'll say uh contact form contactor form and marker will be CF marker is just so that you can very conveniently write the code now let's edit this menu contactor form form title for the site is going to be contact us this is what you are going to show on your website and it has been saved successfully let's come back to form field and we are going to create a template and we'll say contact form and we'll say CF and we'll say for forms for form and we'll click on Create and once you do that you should see your form so if I come back to manage forms there is a contact form you can edit it and you can add attributes to it so we'll say contact form form attributes and we'll say CF and here we are going to say for forms and you can create it and inside this for forms we have this form attributes which we can populate so if you want to add a new attribute you'll say name and marker will be name type is going to be string and then let us say for some reason we want to take number also contact number so we'll say contact and then we'll say contact and this is going to be integer okay let's click on create let us say these are the only two Fields uh or let's also add description description and then we'll say DEC and then do you want to use it yes we want to use it and this is going to be a string let's click on create now this form has been created I'll come back to manage forms and if you click on this pencil if you go to form field you can always choose a template I want to choose my contact form template and then you can select a set of attributes that these are the attributes that I want to use with my form and then you can populate this form and uh you can store data so this is how forms are going to work and this form can easily be displayed on the website on the contact page all right so here comes the fun part we have a form here and we want to fill this form so that the data gets directly into the one entry CMS how do we do that is the question Let's uh see how we are going to do it so if I come to my one entry dashboard you'll see I have a form here and the name of this form is contact form what are the attributes of this contract form I'll uh show you name contact and DEC are the attributes so name contact and deese so um I'll change it to name contact and DEC so let's um come back to our contact page this is our contact page and as you can see that we have onsubmit is equal to uh send email I'll change this to submit form and we are going to create this function oops uh we are going to copy this and let me say const submit form is equal to to and we are going to write this function but before that I want to make sure that we have this form and input type is email placeholder is email let me change this to type is equal to phone and uh let's say value is equal to form. phone and what is form form is going to be a use state snipp it uh I'll remove this ref I'll say use State snippit form set form is equal to use State and we are going to use an empty form so form class name is equal to contact form ID is equal to my form we have a text and name is name here and then once again we have um type is equal to phone here and name is phone here let's change name to contact and also let's change to DEC here and this is going to be your description okay and value is going to be and we don't populate value like this we poate value like this form. DEC so we have form. DEC we have form. name and we have form do phone okay form. name and we are going to add on change to all all of these input tags so let's copy this input Let's uh change on change here as well and let's on change here as well and we'll say cost on change sorry con handle change is equal to and I'm waiting for my llama coder to suggest me some good code and yes I think it has done some good job here yeah let's see if it works so it says use state is not defined we'll have to fix it by importing use State use State and yeah so if I reload it says e is not defined okay so let me change it to ANF F and E and yeah this should work now yeah so if I type something here it is changing so in order to submit this form I'm going to create an API but before that let's retrieve the data from the form so whenever I have submitted this form so let us say if I type something here and then I just type something here and then I type something here I want to ensure that whenever we click on submit the data is logged here but before that we'll have to um click on E do prevent default and uh submit form so we are saying on submit is equal to submit form so whenever we are submitting the form the data is getting reloaded but this time when we are submitting the form the page is not being reloaded because because we have ensured e. prevent default now as you can see that we have current DEC and name here I want to make sure that um I want to make sure that this email shows phone because we have altered everything except the placeholder so let me sa phone here and once we have this data I want to send this data to an API so let's create an API in nextjs so we have this pages but we don't have an API so let's create an API slash submit form. JS and this is going to be a backend API now I'm going to create this function as async and I'll say let r is equal to await Fetch and slash API SL submit form and this is going to be a post request so we are going to say method is post so method is going to be post so here I have the Syntax for post request so we have a name as form. name and then we have uh contact as form. contact and we have DEC as form. DEC and here in our API we have just set request. body so let see if we are hitting submit are we getting this object or not yes we are getting this object so all we need to do now is submit this to one entry so we are going to import Define one entry from one entry so here I have said let rest is equal to await r. Json so basically we are putting a post request on this and our endpoint looks something like this this is a Syntax for posting data to one entry as you can see we have data we have form identifier we have uh value is equal to form data. post form data which is used to post data to one entry CMS let's see if this is working or not so as you can see that I have this form so I'll refresh this I'll say name is Harry and then phone is 7777777777 and this hey I am good and let's hit submit so the moment I hit submit I should see something um something in the console here itself and as you can see we have an object let's try to open this object and it has form data so we basically have submitted the form so now let's check the CMS if we have the data there or not so if I go to managing forms and if I go to contact form let's click on this pencil and let's click on data sent by Form you'll see that uh the data that I've submitted has been punched here so we have this Harry we have this phone number and we have this tesc the last thing that I want to do here is that I want to make sure that this form is reset so I'll say set form I'll say set form and I'll set this form to an empty form so that we don't see any data here after we have submitted so let's uh once again um try to submit this form and let's say hey I am good how are you doing I need to inquire about let us say this is a website on my portfolio about a website I want you to build okay so let's click on submit and the moment I click on submit this data has not yet cleared let me see why this has happened so submit form so the problem here is that we have this ref is equal to form here so we'll have to make sure that this ref is not creating problems so it seems that the surf is not creating problems now and also I want to add one more thing I want to add add uh alert alert data has been submitted successfully okay so data has been submitted successfully and then we have this submit and let's reload this page once again I want to reload this and I'll simply say Harry and then we have this phone number and then we have this hey as message now let's click on submit data has been submitted successfully and the moment I click on okay I'm expecting this form to clear up but it is not clearing up so this is something to worry about let me see why it is not working so I'll change the initial value of this form to an object which has all the entries as blank and then I'll do the same here and it will be working because uh at this point the name deese and contact are getting undefined here in the form so let's reload this page yet again and let's try to fill this form again and let me see what this error is default value or value props uh instead of setting children on text area okay got it so let's not set the children in text area because uh react is suggesting us to not do that so let's do value is equal to value is equal to form. DEC let's do it this way and we should not have any errors now let's reload the page and yes we don't have any errors now let's let's say Harry and then let's try to fill this again and let's try to fill hey and the moment I click submit the data is getting submitted and it says uncaught in promise so this time if I fill the form and if I say hey and if I click on submit the form is getting cleared and the data is getting submitted so this is how everything works and um this is how you work with forms in one entry so if you want to fetch the data from the forms we can create an endpoint and we can create a get end points and we can say get get forms. JS and so in order to get the data from the form we'll have to use this endpoint which is uh get forms data and it takes um and let's use this one uh get forms data by marker and the first argument is marker second argument is uh enus which is L code so we'll change this to uh form data dot get forms data by marker then we have form identifier and let's see if this works so we'll say Local Host API get forms and yes it is getting me all the information so if you want to see all the information of the forms you can see this way now again you'll have to protect this endpoint if you are using it publicly but this is how you get the data from the forms so this is how forms work in one entry I hope you were able to understand Trend and I hope that now you'll be able to implement any form in one entry so I hope that you were able to understand how one entry works and uh how this one entry is uh useful for storing your content and how it can CER to your content needs uh I hope that this video was helpful thank you so much guys for watching this video and I will see you next time
wRWdRwAb9DM,Everybody Must install this vs code extension rapid API has come up with a vs code extension which I've been using since a very long time the biggest game changing thing about this is that you can generate code on the Fly using this extension whether you're coding in JavaScript python or whatever language if you want to test any of your apis you can be within vs code and use this extension also if you want to write fetch code or axis code or code in some other language you can do that being within vs code also you can generate python request code dynamically using this extension there is also an option to choose environment variables right inside vs code you can switch from Dev to plot environment and that too in few clicks so my overall experience has been very great the link to the extension is in the description make sure you download it and let me know in the comments what do you think about it
fl2wY8XnNP4,in this video we are going to solve the chapter one practice set when we are going to see a lot of questions we are going to practically understand all the javascript concepts which we have understood in chapter number one let's go to the computer screen and let's start solving questions from chapter number one [Music] [Applause] all right so it's time to solve our practice and in this practice set we are going to practice everything that we have learned in chapter one so let's get started let me open this video for you so the question number one says create a variable of type string and try to add a number to it so simply a variable is going to be of type string and you have to add a number to it okay let's see what happens and this is what the question says that see what happens when you try to add number to a string is it possible is it going to throw an error let's find out so i'm going to create a new file ch1ps.js chapter one practice it and i'm going to say console.log um practice set okay so so this is my habit if whenever i'm moving to a new environment i just test using console.log you you run this and if it executes all good if it doesn't see the error try to fix the problem okay now create a variable of time string and add an integer to it so i'm going to say let a is equal to harry okay this is a variable of type string and all i'm going to do here is i'm going to say a plus b where my b is going to be an integer okay so i'm going to say let b is equal to 5 and let me run this and what happened uh what just happened you just saw hadi five is being printed on the screen what does this mean this means that whenever you try to add an integer to a string the integer is converted to a string and the resultant output is a string so these two will get concatenated so this is an observation and i wanted you to make this observation question number two use type of operator to find the data type of a string in the last question i actually meant data type of the result in last question okay so not string i meant result okay so let's try to find out the data type of result so let me do something like this i'll say let result is equal to a plus b okay and i'm going to console log result not a plus b okay and also let me mark the question question number two this is question number one let me not write practice at console log question number one question number two question number question number two says simply do this what is going to come in the terminal as the output string is going to come as the output because the result is a string okay question number two is solved question number three says create a const object in javascript can you change it to hold a number later so all you have to do is create a const object okay let's create but before that let me open the screencast mode question number three says just create a variable let me let me do something like this of type um create a const object in javascript okay so this is this should be an object and not let const okay so i'm going to say names names to marks okay is equal to and i'm going to say harry 45 shivani shivani is going to get 89 marks shivani be happy now raghav raghav you are going to get 23 marks i'm sorry then deepika deepika thank me later now all i'm going to do is i'm going to change the names to colon not colon square bracket deepika to zero okay let us say i'm not happy with dpika anymore i give the bigger 99 marks now i'm not happy with dpika anymore what i'm going to do is i'm going to say okay deepika since i'm not happy with you anymore let me do something like this okay let me do something like this i'll say deepika is equal to 78 so from 99 to 78 i know dp is going to get shocked she's going to say i was getting 99 marks why are you giving me 78 marks what's what's happening i don't know the bigger i'm very sorry now if i print no not print sorry console.log console.log is the print of javascript actually i i i code in a lot of languages and i tend to type different functions from different languages and you know this happens so okay so let me let me show you what what just happened this object is a constant and i was able to change deepika's marks what just happened you must be wondering that this is an object and this is a const object why am i able to change the because marks why why why does it not show that this is a constant and you cannot change the because marks actually this value is not constant this object is a constant which means that i have created an object in memory and names to marks is mapping to this object it's kind of pointing to the object now what is happening is this object is in the memory names to marks is a reference this is the name of the reference and this reference is pointing to this thing now if i change this thing i'm not actually changing the reference of names to class to point to something else i'm just changing the same place in memory to deepika 78 so basically the object remains the same the content of the object changes so when the content of the object changes javascript doesn't have any problem even if the object is a constant i hope you understood that which is why i'm able to change the because marks and this question was just created to teach you this so create a const object in javascript can you change it to hold a number later can you actually change it to hold a number later now let me see can i change it to hold a number later let me see can i do something like this can i do something like this let me solve the question now the question was not this the question was can you change it to hold a number can i do something like this is equal to 8 the answer is no i cannot do this it's going to throw an error because i'm actually changing the value of this reference this reference was actually pointing to this object in memory now i am saying create a new integer in memory and make this names two marks point to this node this is not going to happen names to marks is a reference which is a constant and it is going to point to the same thing in the memory i can do this but cannot do this so let me write here cannot do this but can do this okay let me do something like this and names to marks as you already saw i was able to print it okay now let me now let me run this program just to show you that it works yes it works now the next question says that try to add a new key to the const object in problem three were you able to do it now answer this question in the comments can you add a new key to this object i want all of you to pause this video and type your answer in the comments i am going to test how much you learned from the previous example that i took pause this video and write yes or no can you add a new key to this object and i'm going to tell you the answer to this okay i hope everybody commented now let me add okay and let me debug is a nice guy let me give him 98 but not as nice as deepika was before note that i'm just kidding so names to marks deeper is equal to 98 i'm actually adding a new key to the object names to marks can i do that let's find out let me run this program the answer is yes i can do that because the object remains the same i'm just expanding the same object i can always do that i can either expand the object i can change the because marks to 78 i can do all these things but i cannot make names to marks to point to a different place in memory this is not possible okay let me run this program and show you that this is possible we just added deepak to the object and yes this is a const object but we were able to add deeper to this okay i hope you understood what i wanted you to understand now the question number five says that write a javascript program to create a word winning dictionary of five words okay so this is something that i want you to actually do but let's go to digital.com dictionary.com yes this one okay let me copy paste i can why am i not able to see words like the home page is supposed to show me a few words right so let let me let me say question number four here this is actually question number four this was me explaining question number four this is question number five and the question number five is write a javascript program to create a dictionary so let's do that so i'll say constdict is equal to remember i told you that you you have to use const everywhere you can anywhere you want to use a variable try to use const first if you're not able to use const try to use lit avoid wear okay now constict is equal to this thing let me paste this word ataraxia do you know the meaning of this word no you don't your english is not as good as mine the meaning of attraction is a state of freedom from emotional disturbance and anxiety what are you guys doing very bad okay anyways no problems at all let's talk about the second word do you know the meaning of this no mon you don't the meaning is raised part of the sundial that cast the shadow shame on you you don't know the meaning of this because your english is not as good as mine so let me copy this uh let me copy this and let me paste it i'm actually a better copy waster than you i can challenge you okay do you know yukka you don't know yukka shame on you it means hard work all you so i want all of you to do yaka okay everybody should do yakka yaka is something that that is going to you know give you some success no computer game no laptop no roaming with friends nothing is going to give you success only yakka is going to give you success focus on yakka and forget everything else just kidding ever okay so so i actually wanted to add five words i'm just trying to entertain you guys while i'm adding these words so don't try to take me seriously please so one two three four we have added four words i mean take me seriously while i'm teaching javascript don't take me seriously while i am trying to entertain you okay so you have to figure out when i'm trying to take you in when i'm teaching javascript okay so a fossil footprint okay so let me paste this and let's see if i can print a dick dot yaka okay so it should tell me work specially hard work okay so so you can see that work especially hard work is being printed on the screen i want all of you guys to tell me that whether you are enjoying this course or not i want all of you to tell me in the comment section right now and also if you haven't already access the javascript playlist make sure you do that this is a javascript english playlist make sure you access this so that you have access to all the videos i hope you were able to understand these problems and i hope these practice sets are helping you a lot thank you so much guys for watching this video and i will see you next time [Music] so [Music]
2qXziTfLTvQ,"in this video we'll see what aight cloud is and why aight Cloud can be used as an amazing back end if you have your front end ready you don't have to invest your time developing backend from scratch and aight is storing and managing all your data on the cloud how amazing is that so we'll now move on to a computer screen and we'll see how to build a Blog using app right loud let's get started all right guys so here I am inside my computer screen and we look into aight Cloud app.io so let's go to aight. and we'll go to app right Cloud to build something amazing so I'm assuming that my front end is ready so I'll only be creating back end let's go to nextjs nextjs create next app yes I want to use nextjs and let's search for Tailwind templates Tailwind templates but before we use these Tailwind CSS templates uh let's create a new Next app okay so let's run this command we'll be running this command and I'll fire a terminal here npx create Next Step latest and yes I want to proceed I'll say app right blog and let me call it app right Cloud blog just to make sure that what I'm creating is descriptive no I don't want uh es lint yes I want Tailwind CSS do we need an SRC directory no uh let's not use an SRC directory yes I want to use app router and would you like to customize the default Al as no let's wait for it to install everything and once everything is installed we'll come back and we'll run our app but in the meantime let's log to app right so that we can get started by creating a backend so basically aight is backend as a service I already have an account on aight if you don't have an account you can create one but make sure that uh you are doing what whatever I'm doing as is because I'll be following some steps and if you don't follow them Asis you might be in trouble so let's create a new organization I'll say code with Harry so the very first step for you is to create an organization I'm creating an organization called code with Harry and now I'll click on organization ID uh app right basically uh generates One automatically but if you want to add in some new ID you can add a unique ID and let's select a plan you can always start for free if if you go to app.io uh one thing that I like about them is that you get unlimited projects free of cost with 10gb of bandwidth and 2GB of storage 2GB is a lot uh to get started and if you are making anything serious you can always upgrade so we have created this organization and let's create a new project I want to call this blog and let's name our blog as hunting coder so hunting order is the name of the blog that I want to choose and it is asking me for a region to to deploy I can use Bangalore because I'm in India but uh the thing is that they don't have one at this point and I can always click on notify me whenever this region is available let's go for Frankford because this only seems to be the region which is available now we have hunting coder project created uh it is asking me for a platform choose a platform which platform do you want to choose and I'll click on web and uh I will register my host name I'll say local PC and this is the name of my host name I'll say Local Host you can always choose your domain or versal DOA or gitpod doio whatever you using let's click on next and this is something that we need to install because app right provides you with a package which you can use to connect to the back end so where is our blog project here is the blog let's open this in VSS code and let's fire our terminal and uh let's say npm install app right so that we have app right installed I'll say npm run Dev which will start the dev server and this is how our next USS app is looking at this point so it's still building it yes this is how our nextjs app is looking at this point definitely we'll want to use uh something to fill this template and we want to remove all of this boilerplate code but let's get started by going to the app directory and then page.js and we will be removing this this main tag and let me replace it with Dev and I'll say jsx JavaScript react and let's write navbar is here okay and let's also remove all the global CSS except this Tailwind CSS and let's see how our code is looking at this point so this is how our code is looking at this point it looks pretty good let's use app right now so if you come back to this page they have all the instructions npm install app right we have already done that now this this is how you import app right in web SDK we'll copy this code we'll say next and this is how you create a new client so uh let's import the client first so on our page we'll say import client as uh import client from app right and then we'll copy this code and this contains all the things that we need so it's creating a new client for me let's create a new client inside this function and let's do format docent ment and I'll click on next and you are ready to go congratulations on adding the first platform to your project now I can always add more platforms to my project it's up to me it's my choice I can go for flutter I can even go for some other platform same app same project some other platform so that we can connect to the same back end now let's go to dashboard if you don't know why we are using app right Cloud uh the primary reason is that it takes all the hassle uh out of your code the the meaning of this thing is is that you are writing a back end you don't have to worry about anything like authentication you don't have to worry about storage and with app right loud they are bringing a lot of innovation which is something that I like about them uh authentication is there database is there storage is there function is game changing I'll tell you what functions are and they are also coming up with realtime stuff so that you can create chart apps plus when you use authentication you can use Google authentication GitHub authentication Apple Microsoft uh which means that people can come with their Google account and sign up to your app you don't have to write authentication from scratch okay and you do don't have to worry about any problem that you might face after writing authentications because security has to be taken seriously okay so let's come back to our app and let's see uh what we get at this point so uh the very first thing that I want to uh cover is au so let's create a new user and let's uh name this user as Harry Harry at COD withh harry.com and um I'll simply put some phone number and let's choose the password as Harry so it is asking me to choose a strong password I'll be choosing a stronger password and I'll hit create it says that invalid phone phone number must start with a plus okay we'll add a plus 91 and this is the phone number of the user and let's click on Create and uh this is the username this is the password I don't want to update it but uh this is uh how you can create a new user now this user is UN verified you can always verify this account and uh you can do this programmatically as well but uh let's not add any more labels and let's not play around with this user you can always add a label called admin or premium or some other label uh you can add all those labels programmatically now let's come back to database and let's create a database so the database is going to be blogs because this is going to be our blog we'll give the task of adding a random ID to app right and we'll hit create and the blogs has been created which is simply a database let's add a new collection called blogs so this is how we can create a new collection and inside our blocks database we have a blocks collection and here will be some documents you can always specify a schema and you can go back to documentation which will tell you about how you can use this but at this point I just want to make sure that uh I have a Blog uh inside my blogs collection so let's create a new document we'll create an attribute we'll say uh let's create an attribute called string the key is going to be title so this is a title and uh can be say 200 characters default is uh let's not have a default value yes it is required and we'll create it so everything that you want to create will be here let's create another attribute and this is going to be uh blog HTML blog HTML and size is going to be 2,000 characters uh rather let's make it 5,000 or 8,000 characters because I want to make sure that I have plenty of space for blog and this is going to be required and we'll create another attribute and we'll see if we have anything else now let's add a datetime field and uh it will be created at created at and we can uh make it null and default value can be null and we'll hit create okay and we have uh the title of the blog we have the content of the blog now let's add an author we can say author uh we can also say email or URL let's add something like URL because this is going to be the slug and default value is uh null and this should be required let's say create what else do we have in a blog we have written by which is a user or we can also have a relationship with user like which user has written this blog but I'll keep it simple uh and instead of creating a relationship I can simply add user as a string so we'll say user and size can be uh 20 characters or 30 characters should be fine and uh let's keep it required or we can also give it null because we we always don't have to mention which user has written it and this is a basic collection let's add a new document now and whenever we add a new document and this type of form will be shown to us so title of this blog is going to be JavaScript tutorials let us say and uh blog HTML can be uh say paragraph uh Java Script is a programming language and uh let's close this paragraph you can also use markdown but I'm not using markdown at this point and created at can be today's date you can say today and slug can be JS tutorial and user can be say Harry the note that user is a string not a relation let's click on next and it says please enter a URL so uh slug is basically uh the URL is basically not slug uh so let's do one thing let's go back to attributes and delete this URL because uh I need a slug not URL uh so let's create an attribute and I'll select string and I'll say slug size can be 30 characters or maybe 100 characters because slug can be a long one as well required create uh documents create a document title can be JavaScript tutorial and HTML can be this is JS tutorial and this is the paragraph and let's say it created at and then user is going to be Harry h a r r y Harry and JS tutorial for beginners and let's hit next and document security is disabled if you want to assign document permissions navigate to collection setting and enable document security otherwise only collection permissions will be used okay so uh let's hit on create but in case you want to restrict this document or all the documents that we create here to specific users you can always go to settings and then permissions and you can hit this plus and you can say all guests can read but not update and you can say all users all the users which are created they can say uh create and also read okay so let's update this uh and once we have done this we can enable document security also so when document security is enabled users will be able to access document for which they have been granted either document or collection permission so if you want to enable security at a document level you can go for document security but at this point I'm not enabling document security I'm disabling it let's come back to documents and uh we have only one document at this point now let's come back to uh the dogs and let's see how we can access the documents so this is how you can access a document so uh we'll have to enter a project ID uh this is a JavaScript code uh which will help us get all the documents uh or uh say blocks in our case so let's copy this code databases is equal to new databases client so we have the project ID we have this part set up now let's copy this code and I'll put it inside use effect so we are using react so we'll simply go uh and say use effect use effect snippet and inside the use effect I will fetch all the blogs so this is how we can fetch all the blocks cons promise is equal to document. create document databases. create document now we'll have to import databases as well so we will import databases and ID so let's import databases and IDs as well and uh we'll copy the database ID and collection ID here so let's go back to our app right and we can copy this um collection ID so collection ID should come here and then let's copy the database ID as well so database ID is here so this is our database we have copied the database ID and let's space the database ID here and the same goes for this promise so promise is equal to this and promise. then this let's see what happens so it says use effect is not defined you have to import use effect so import use effect from react does it work should work should work should work you're importing a component that needs okay so we'll have to create this as a client component so use client for client component and this should work now this should work please work so it doesn't work it seems says databases is not defined why is databases not defined I think we'll have to create a new database from client so databases is equal to new databases client yeah it works now so let's come back to our console and let's see if we are getting any documents it says app right exception the document data is missing try again with document data populated so document data is missing and we'll have to see why this is happening so inside our database we have this collection and inside this collection we have this document but it says that this document is not available uh so document security is disabled which is good uh this is the document data and uh we have no activity on this document let's see why is it not fetching all the documents okay so the problem is that we are trying to create a document we don't have to create a document we have to fetch all the documents and in order to fetch all the documents we will come back to this list document documentation and this is going to be the query so let's copy this query and let let's paste it here so we'll say promise is equal to databases. list documents and we'll use the database ID and we'll use the same database ID and collection ID so let's contr X here let's cut it and query. equal and we'll say slug or let's say um let's leave it empty so I want to fetch all the documents and I want to make sure that all the documents are fetched and yes all the documents are being fetched so all the documents are being fetched so we have only one document JavaScript tutorial this is JS tutorial let's add some more documents okay so we'll come back to our uh back end and let's click on create document and we'll say this is going to be say Python tutorial Python tutorial Python tutorial and blog HTML can be uh I'll go to chart gbd I'll go to chart gbd to fill in this data and I'll say generate uh a dummy document with title uh HTML content and then I'll say date and uh what else slug okay and yes it is generating it is generating some dummy document for me okay so I don't like it actually I don't know why so it is adding the header title is there section is there so let's copy this and let's add it to blog HTML and create it at canb today and this can be Python tutorial sorry and user can be Harry and I'll click on next and I'll create this then let's create another document I'll say uh jQuery tutorial so likewise we can add even more documents and we can create a UI and display all the documents using our UI so let's do one thing let's create a state here so I'll import use state from react use State and uh let's create a state called blogs so I'll say use State step it and we'll say blogs set blogs is equal to an empty array okay and we'll say promise dot then and uh after getting the response we'll say uh let's uh change the response uh sorry let's change the blocks and set the blocks as the response which is going to be an array. documents and I want to make sure that the response. documents is an array and yes it is an array so response. documents is an array and will display all the blogs and in order to display a Navar here we will create a component called Navar so let's create a folder called components and inside the components we'll have a navb bar. JS and let's go to chat GPD and I'm going to tell chart GPD that please generate a navbar using HTML CSS uh sorry HTML and Tailwind okay and it will give me a jsx Navar but it it's not giving me a jsx Navar I don't know why but um I think that should be fine because uh ra fce and this is the Navar let's remove this comment let's remove this one we'll say hunting coder hunting coder and let's import the Navar here so navbar let's import Navar first import nav bar import Navar from components Navar and let's say we want to insert the nav bar here and a nav bar is here and chart GPD has generated a nice nav bar and yeah it's looking good on mobile as well so this is our nav bar let's let's see uh create a block pach showing all the blocks in similar color schemes scheme using jsx uh at the starting of the video I told you that I'm assuming that UI is already created so I have other UI videos in case you want uh to watch UI videos but this is how we can say blogs. map and this is this is amazing I mean let's copy this and I'll show you why I'm calling it so amazing so after nbar after nbar I'm going to say blogs. map and blog is going to have a title and it has blog HTML I guess yeah it's called blog HTML inside our documents yeah just is called blog HTML so let's call uh call it blog HTML blog HTML and is it displaying the blog HTML yeah but this is not how it's going to work uh let's add another attribute in the blog or we can always pass the blog HTML convert it to text and then take some part of the text we can do that as well but uh let's see how this is looking and we can add a read more button generate a read more button so this is how a read more button is going to look like read more button uh and it is adding a read more Buton to the same thing let's copy the button and let's paste the button here and uh we are living in an AI era guys so uh do not hesitate to use AI we should be using AI whenever we can and now I'll say generate a Blog Page in a similar color scheme generate a generate a Blog Page uh using similar color scheme taking slug as slug in the URL let's see if it can understand this otherwise we'll have to uh create it on our own and it is using react router Dom uh I want to use nextjs but let's tell it that I want to use let's stop it and we'll say I am using nextjs I'm using nextjs URL I am using nextjs so it is not going to use react router Dom now so we'll create a file called slug DJs inside Pages directory but uh we are not using Pages directory we are using App directory so inside app directory we can create a folder called Slug and inside slug we can say page.js and inside this page.js we can do the same same thing let's copy this code and let's paste this code and it is using server side props I don't want to use server side props rather uh this is going to be a server component nextjs has changed we are on version 14 if I'm not wrong yes we are on version 14 of nextjs now and version 14 of nextjs has different ways of doing things I'll show you what those ways are so inside This Server component we'll fetch all the data so whatever we are doing in side of get server side props we are going to do that here and once we have done it which means that we are on the server once we have done it uh we have all the content so we have the blog data and we can fetch it using app right uh and obviously we are going to fetch it using app right but let's let's remove this for now and we'll simply display the slug so we'll just display the slug here and we'll fix it later we'll fix it later so slug Slug and let's remove this get server s side props and if I go to say local SL something it should show me something it says peram is not defined why why why why perams is not defined slug is equal to perams uh slug is equal to perams so title and content are in the props uh slug should be in the perams okay so either we can say perams here or we can simply add slug here to get the slug and how do I know this I've read the documentation you can also read the documentation and if I reload this we we are getting the page but not sure why it is not rendering properly so we are getting slash something here but why is this something not getting rendered here uh is still something that I cannot understand let's try to type something so if I try to type something it is coming but this thing is not working so I'll have to see why okay so we don't have any slug we don't have any slug the slug is empty so when I say slug we don't have any slug which means that nothing is being rendered so if I say the slug and if I say content here here uh there okay so I've written something wrong so this is how our page is going to render but it is not rendering properly because uh slug is not coming properly so let's see how I will get the slug so so we have app /blog SL Slug and then page.js and then perm. slug okay so I'll have to do something like this so I'll say perms and inside the perams will be the slug so this is how it is going to work so the slug something content here let's add the nav bar as well so um we'll wrap it inside the anchor tags and I'll add a nav bar so import nav bar import import Navar and let's wrap it inside uh inside these uh anchor brackets and yeah this is our blog so the homepage of our blog is going to look something like this and we can always say slash blog poost SL slug so I can move this slug inside a folder called blog post okay that is that is up to me I can either do that or uh in fact let's do it so let's go to app and inside app we can create a folder called blog post new folder blog post and let's move this to this luck to blog post and now if I go to SL block poost slash something it will be displayed like this okay now let's refine the page so I've added something um these Slug and all those those text let's remove all these texts and here should be the title of the document and here should be the content of the document and if I need any other information uh of the document I can add it here okay let's come back to this page and uh we can add a link tag so we can import link from next link so let's import link from next link and we'll say that so we'll say that link HF is equal to something and let's add the title so whenever somebody clicks on the title they should be redirected to this page so HF should be equal to the slash blog post so let's add a template literal so I'll say SL blog poost SL blog post and Slash blog. Slug and this will be the slug of the blog okay okay so whenever somebody clicks on [Music] the let's go back and whenever somebody clicks on this title they should be directed to the blog and yeah they are being directed to the blog now all we need to do here is that we need to convert this to text so in order to convert HTML to text we will simply create a function and uh we can ask chart jbd to create it so write a function to convert HTML string to PL string and it has given me a function and I'm going to use this function so let's copy this function and let's put this function right after our use effect and HTML to plane and I'll say HTML to plane control X HTML to PL text and I'll give blog. HTML and it is giving me the text now and I can always get first few characters maybe first 20 characters so PL text. TR return PL text. trm and let's take only 10 characters so I'll have to do do subst strr do substring 0 to say 20 characters and then I can include a triple dot I can include a triple Dot and you can always do all those things if there are if there are any more characters than 20 characters you will add triple dot otherwise you will not add triple dots you can do all those things but I'll keep it really very simple but let's add some more characters to this I'll make it 50 maybe because uh 20 looks too less so I've added 50 this is JS tutorial whenever somebody clicks on the JS tutorial they should be directed to the JS tutorial and the Navar should also direct to slash when click and let's change this to a link we'll change this to a link import link from next link import link from next link yes so whenever somebody clicks on Hunting coder they should be directed to this page then JavaScript and then Python tutorial yes so aight is basically fetching all the documents and let me remove this s dfsdf why is it not being removed I will have to check so where is this SDF SDF I have written SDF SDF somewhere and this is on the slug page stf stf why is it not going stf stfy is it coming here let's search for this string so it it is inside page.js of blog post okay so it it is inside this page.js of blog post let's remove this and do I have a page.js inside slug oh I by I mistakenly copied this instead of cutting so I'll have to delete this slug so let's delete this slug because I have it inside blog post and yeah it should work now so now the next step is going to be fetch the correct title using Slug and populate the blog post let's go so we'll come back to the app right documentation and we are going to fetch a new document in fact we are going to fetch using a query and we are going to say slug equals this so let's copy this code and we'll say query. equal and we'll say slug should be equal to this so uh let's get everything from here we are going to import client database ID from Mite and then we are going to get all this we are going to get all this code right back here and let's create it as a client component but before we create this as a client component we will have to fetch this document on the server site in fact we don't even have to fetch this from the server site it is going to run on client uh let's copy this we have copied This Promise is equal to this uh let's remove this and this time we are going to say query dot equals and we'll say slug should be equal to slug okay slug should be equal to slug query do equal slug should be equal to Slug and we are going to get the promise and then we'll say whenever This Promise resolves whenever this promise resolves we should get we should get the document so whenever the promise resols we should get the document and let's remove this we are going to get the response once the prise resolves so let's reload this page now again there is some syntax error it seems what is the syntax error I cannot spot the syntax error okay so there there is an error in some opening closing tag it seems so promise dot okay promise is equal to this okay so we have a use effect here let's remove this use effect uh but if I remove this use effect everything is happening on the server um which should be fine I mean even if it's happening on the server this should be fine so if I reload it says use state is not defined so let's remove use state where is use state where is use state so I have use State somewhere use State okay let's remove this and now it should load say query is not defined so we are going to import query from map right query and yeah it works but we have some hydration error we'll ignore it we'll change class to class name soon but let's see if we are getting this block printed or not so we are not getting this response printed and it should be printed inside uh our terminal so let's open our server side terminal and yeah it is being updated here as you can see so if you say response. documents documents so if you say response. documents response. documents it should print only the documents so we have the user we have the slug we we have the title we have everything so let's do one thing so response do document Z is going to be that document now can we pass this response. document zero here so can we pass this somewhere here yeah we can actually pass it how do we do that we'll have to create this as a client component and then we'll run this inside use effect so let's do it so let's say uh use client use client and let's wrap it inside use effect snipet use effect snippet and let's wrap this entire thing inside use effect snippet format document and response. documents will now come to our this console so it says use effect is not defined import use effect from react and and yeah we have this document here so all we need to do now is we'll say use State snippet and we'll call it Blog blog not blog post so blog set blog is going to be null which is going to be uh undefined blog is undefined initially not null it is going to be undefined initially and then we are going to right click format document and then we are going to Simply get the blog. title and blog dot do blog HTML populated here so we are going to say set blog response. document Z this will update the title of the blog and let's reload this page and see if everything is working no it says use state is not defined okay so blog. title undefined cannot read State title undefined so we'll say question mark Dot and yeah so the slug JavaScript tutorial this is Javascript tutorial and let's use dangerously set inner HTML so we'll say dangerously set inner HTML is equal to underscore HTML so we'll add the object underscore HTML is going to be this contr x control V and this should work now so it says dangerously set in HTML is not like it expected it so uh underscore uncore HTML should be the markup okay so it should be underscore uncore HTML instead of underscore HTML and yeah it is being rendered now so let's remove the slug I want to remove this the slug from here and this is how you create a blog using HTML CSS JavaScript and aight so you can keep on adding more blogs by going to aight cloud and uh you can use different functionalities of aite you can also create a storage you can use a lot of other features that are available in aight so let me know in the comment section how you like this video I have updated the title and description as well uh so the title and meta description has been updated so that our website looks good you can go ahead and make more pages like about Services contact and use different features of aite thank you so much guys for watching this video and I will see you next time"
agXU_IjTy0Y,in this video we are going to see the difference between var const and lit web was found in pre es6 code if you have ever seen any javascript code which was written back in 2000s or maybe late 90s you will see var being used as a keyword to declare variables where is something we should always try to avoid in a javascript code because it can introduce bug in our javascript code on the other hand const is used to create constant identifiers whose values cannot be changed let is used to create block scope variables in javascript we will now go to a computer screen and see what let where and cost are why we should avoid var why we should try to use const as much as possible and why we should use let instead of var to declare a variable which might change later let's get started [Music] [Applause] so in a previous video i showed you what variables are how to choose the names of the variable in this video we are going to discuss the difference between var let and cost let me show you something i've created a file right here and the name of the file which i created is zero three underscore let where cost because i am naming all the files with the video number so that you can find the corresponding code for a given video let me show you what is where var is a classic way of creating a variable in javascript if you want to create a variable in javascript all you have to do is you can do something like this where a is equal to 34 and here is your um variable gate of copilot is suggesting me a lot of things so i'm not taking the suggestions for now where a is equal to 34 means that create a variable and store 34 inside of that variable as simple as that no confusion so far okay var is a keyword which is present in javascript from very early days this was a keyword which was available to us since the inception of javascript and this is a classic way of creating a variable in javascript but there are some limitations with var which is it might introduce some of the bugs in your programs now you might think that why do we care about that why can't we just use var there is a lot of convenience function which we get after using cost and let and i'll show you what that convenience is so before we get started let me show you the notes var versus latin javascript where is globally scoped while let and con start block scope i'll show you what this means if i say var a is equal to 34 and i do something like this console.log a no prices for guessing you will get 34 printed okay now if i change where with let nothing changes nothing changes at all and you will say oh why why why why are we even using lead then i'll show you why we should use let and const instead of now since i have let a is equal to 34 if i create a block this block might be an if statement this block might be while loop for loop it can be any block okay if i do something like this let a is equal to 45 and if i do something like this console.log a what is going to happen firstly 34 is going to print on the screen and then 45 is going to print on the screen as you have already seen okay now if i change this to var and if i do something like this if i do something like this and let me also change this to wire now if i do something like this you'll see 34 45 45 but if i change these to let you see that the output will change so instead of 34 45 45 we'll get 34 45 34 what is happening why did the output change let me explain you why we use lead so var is a classic way of declaring variable in javascript let a is equal to 34 means that a is going to be 34 inside of this block now this is the global scope this is not inside any block so a is going to be 34 and the scope of a is going to be global when we come inside of this block a is 45 but within this block it has nothing to do with the global a okay now if i print a or if i try to change a if i try to do something like this this is not going to change this a which is a global a has no relation at all with this block scope day so if i run this program you will see that 34 934 is printed but when we say where a is equal to 34 what happens is i'm basically creating a global variable a which is 34 and i'm redeclaring a with 45 which means that the global is going to change so i am basically changing my global a to 9. if i run this this is going to print 34 9 and 9. there is no concept of block scope when we use var but when we use let the scope of the variable is within that block only what is the advantage of this what what kind of advantage do we get by using let i'll show you let us say you say where a is equal to 34 you can once again say where a is equal to 89 this is not going to throw any error but this should ideally throw some error because accidentally you might change or redeclare the same variable which might introduce bugs in your program so as a rule of thumb we try to avoid using var and we always focus on let and const so that is something we are going to avoid let me write here avoid var avoid using var okay now because it can be overridden okay so this is something that good github co-pilot is suggesting and it's amazing i love it okay let me come back to the notes and show you some of the properties of flat valence so where as we already saw you can redeclare it you can store anything inside of it this is globally scoped and let in constant block scope now where can be updated and re-declared within its scope which is not a good thing you should not be able to redeclare a variable in javascript but if you are using var you will be able to redeclare so we should use latin cost for this reason because if you are able to redeclare a variable you might even do it accidentally and if you are accidentally declaring a variable this might induce bugs in your program we don't want that now let can be updated but not re-declared i'll show you this if i do something like this let b is equal to 4 i can always say b is equal to 9 but i cannot say let b is equal to 98 once again this will throw an error because b is already defined b is already defined you cannot say let b is equal to 98 once again but if you use var you can do this okay so you you cannot do this with it coming back to the notes cost can neither be updated nor be declared if i'm using something like this now let me show you const if i do something like this const a is equal to 45 and if i do something like this console.log a i think this is going to throw an error because i've already used identifier a yes it is throwing an error let me let me change it to cac means constant a okay let me see if it's printing 45 yes it prints 45 can i change ca is equal to 787 now this is showing me some comments this will throw an error because ca is already defined okay so ca is already defined and it is showing an error you cannot change the value of a constant variable in fact i should not even call it a variable constant is a constant it's not variable you cannot change the value of a constant identifier is something i should say so cos c is equal to 45 will store 45 inside of the ca variable but if i say c is equal to 787 you cannot do that because this is a constant and its value will remain the same throughout the program if i change this cost to let will i be able to change the value will i be able to bypass the error the answer is yes i'll be able to bypass the error because now i can change the value of ca but with const you cannot change the value of ca okay i hope you were able to understand that now point number five and six where variables are initialized with undefined whereas let and cost variables are not initialized with const you always have to initialize so let me show you if you if you do let a a bb if you do let or rather wear bb and cons cc you cannot do const cc because you will have to give it a value you cannot leave it just declared and not initialized this is something which is going to throw an error because cc is already defined no because cc is not defined is not given a value okay this will throw an error because cc is not given a value you should give a value to cc now if i print a a it will be undefined if i print b it will be undefined okay i hope that helps if i do console.log a a b b and this will throw an error so let me comment this and if i run this program it's throwing another y y okay because i'm changing a constant here let me run this program now it will not throw an error so undefined undefined okay point number six says cost must be initialized during declaration unlike let and var so you should initialize cos we already saw that you cannot just leave cost cc like this you will have to give it a value if you don't give it a value you are going to get another so i hope that you were able to understand the difference between let var and cons as a rule of thumb we'll avoid var and we'll always use let and const in our javascript programs so thank you so much guys for watching this video if you haven't already access this playlist make sure you do that thank you so much guys for watching this video and i will see you next time [Music]
JF6c8jvS3c8,in this video we are going to learn about data types in javascript javascript is a language which has some built-in data types as well as non-primitive data type which is an object there are seven primitive data types in javascript you can learn it like this nnn ssbb and you nn means null and number ss means symbol and string bb means bigint and boolean and u for undefined there are seven primitive data types and object is the non-primitive data type in javascript data types determine what kind of content can be stored in a variable so if data type of some variable is string that means that this variable is holding a string at this point we'll now go to a computer screen and we'll see how to create primitive data types and non-primitive data types and the difference between two and how object is a key value appear which can be used to store data in javascript let's get started [Music] [Applause] in our previous videos we learned about what variables in javascript are we started this course with the basics of programming and i hope you are liking this series if you haven't already bookmarked this playlist make sure you click here to bookmark and um click here to save this playlist now we are going to talk about uh primitives in javascript so i'm going to open this chapter let me open the pdf first and inside the pdf i just told you what where latin const is what is the difference and why and when to use which one okay so now we are going to talk about primitives and objects what exactly are primitive data types in javascript what exactly is a data type in programming language let me answer that question first data type in a programming language is a type of container which can store a specific kind of data let's say i created a variable let me open this and let me do shift right click and open with code and let me create a file for this video i'm going to name the file as 04 underscore primitives dodges okay let me tell you i already have node installed let us say i create a variable let a is equal to 67 let me zoom in a bit i am using control plus scroll to zoom in if you don't know i can actually do toggle screen cast mode and you will see which key is being pressed and this is actually awesome let me tell you so what i'm going to do is i'm going to select a is equal to 67 if i do something like this what is type of a typo is an operator which exactly tells me the type of this variable now you will see what exactly is a type of variable type of variable means the kind of data it is storing let us say i give you a coffee mug i'll ask you what exactly is this story most probably your answer is going to be this is going to store some coffee or maybe tea or some other beverage so if i run this program this is going to tell me that i'm storing a number on the other hand if i do something like this and if i run this you'll see that it now outputs string which means that now string is being stored inside of a so data type is the type which is being stored by a variable now coming back to the nodes primitive data types are set of basic data types in javascript the fundamental data types in javascript object is a non-primitive data type in javascript object can contain a string it can contain a number or arrays or it might even contain another object we'll talk about all these things in our later videos but let's understand the seven primitive data types in javascript null number string symbol undefined boolean and begin null number string boolean and undefined is something that we are going to talk about symbol and big end is something that we are going to talk about in a later video so let's focus on these numbers when i say let a or let b b doesn't contain anything so b will be undefined by default so if i do something like this if i print b you'll see undefined so undefined means something is not defined we haven't made b to contain something okay we haven't stored anything inside this container and the name of the container is b okay i hope that this is clear now if i do something like this b is equal to let us say false false is a boolean variable and let me run this and you will see that false is being printed on the screen now this might confuse some of the people so let me organize this program very very nicely if i do something like this let a wait let me let me print a and then type of a this actually tells you the data type of a okay this tells you the data type of a now if i do something like this b contains undefined by default i want all of you to get access to these programs because i have written comments in such a way that it will make learning better for you okay now if i do something like this b is equal to say 23 b now contains a number because js is dynamically typed wait wait let me change this comment we can uh change the type b contains because b is dynamically typed now let me explain this the first lines are really very clear we are just seeing the data type of a b contains undefined by default b is equal to 23 means that we are changing the value of b from undefined to a number which is 23 okay i hope this is clear to all of you now we can change the type of b uh we can change the type b contains because js is dynamically typed what does this mean javascript is actually a dynamically typed language we have statically typed languages like c language or java but javascript is dynamically typed which means that if a variable is containing a number it can later be made to store a string it can later be made to store a boolean and so on so js is dynamically typed now let me create another variable for you before that let me run this program and show you that this does not throw an error okay i hope that this is clear to all of you now i'll say let c is equal to false and then i'll do c is equal to true this is a boolean variable make sure that f in false is small case and t in true is also lower case okay now these are two types of boolean variables that we have you can either have c to contain false or c might be true now if i do something like this it will show me the value of c as you can see true okay now c is actually a boolean variable and when i change the value of c to true it's again a boolean variable so boolean variables can have two values one of two values true or false okay so we talked about number we talked about string let me show you string as well d is equal to if i do something like this this is a string okay wait let me do console.log and let me do d and you'll see that harry is being printed on the screen what if i do something like this type of d this will tell me the d's of type string okay no surprises there and no prizes for guessing there okay so let me now tell you about boolean i already told you about boolean big intent symbol is something that we are going to see in the later videos null null is something which is confused with undefined sometimes but let me tell you the difference between null and undefined undefined means that we haven't yet defined anything we have just declared a variable and it has it has not been defined null means that we explicitly telling that this variable contains nothing so if i do something like this and do console.log null sorry console.log e e contains null you will see that null is being printed on the screen so null and undefined are two different data types in javascript is something that you need to remember okay so we have talked about data types in javascript i hope that this is very very clear to all of you now we'll talk about object in javascript what exactly is an object primitive data type is something which is the very fundamental type of variable in javascript you can have a string any variable in javascript can either be one of these or can either be made of one of these this is the meaning of primitive data types okay now let's talk about object object is a key value pair in javascript object objects in javascript okay are complex data types no i don't want to write that so github copied is actually showing me suggestions i don't want that okay so if i do something like this let f is equal to come on come on get up co-pilot you are doing great come on get up come on get up co-pilot so this is actually generated an object for me if you don't know what github copy it is you might not have one but this actually suggests you the code as you type now this is this is not related to javascript and i think i need to deactivate my github copied for javascript because i don't want it to distract us while we are typing now let us say i have this object obj is equal to name harry h23 is married false this object is a key value pair if i do something like this obj obj.name this will actually print harry if i do something like this it will print 23. if i do something like this this will print false okay now you'll say why should we use javascript objects javascript objects can be used to store key value pairs so let us say you want to store the name of a student in a classroom and his marks in a subject okay you'll say the name of the person harry and you'll see the marks of the person so let me remove this and let me show you if i do something like this harry let us say mark's obtained a 7 8 78 [Applause] let us say mark's obtained a 90. oh wait a second now let us say i want to write ritika and marks obtained by ritika is 89 and let me also write lavish marks obtained 78 let me write rohan marks obtained 56 not not not not an intelligent student at all no worries so if i do something like this obj dot rohan obj dot rohan is going to return 56 okay i can even do something like this so there are two types of syntax which i can use i can do something like this as well this will also give me the value of one corresponding value to the key row 1 okay so if i run this it will give me 56 again if i change it to say a lovish it will show me this now i'll show you something what if i change this to rohan das okay inside of double quotes now since this is a string the key is a string which contains a space i cannot do something like this obj dot rohan das if i run this this will throw an error so i am bound to use this syntax i'll have to use this syntax this is not going to work wait this is not going to work because of this space in this string okay in the key in the key okay now if i run this program this will work because i haven't closed the key in double quotes okay so i hope that you are getting this i hope everything is cleared object are simply key value pairs we can even have nested objects we can even have values as arrays we can even have values as booleans we just saw and we can even have values as some other primitive data types it's all your choice you are going to see a lot of complicated objects in the future videos so be ready for that and solve this quick quiz very very quickly write a javascript program to name phone number and marks of a student using objects all you have to do is you have to write a program you'll have to store the name phone number and marks of a student and you have to do this using object so come on do that so this is something that i'll expect from you to answer in the comments make sure you write a program and give me the program in the comments and i'll wait for your answer and make sure that you're solving the quiz regularly because this is something which is very important if you practice hard enough you are going to get the results okay and make sure that you access this javascript playlist because this is going to be the place where i'm going to upload everything so i hope that you like this video make sure you access the notes thank you so much guys for watching this video and i will see you next [Music] [Music] you

Z51jMk6N1zY,[Music] this video is dedicated to operators and expressions i am going to explain you what expressions in javascript are for instance when you are writing 7 plus 5 is equal to 12 7 and 5 are operands plus is operator and 12 is the result we are going to understand all these basics in this video and also we are going to see the types of operators which are present in javascript expression in javascript on the other hand is a value which can be given to either a variable or a constant or it can even be returned from a function which we are going to see in the later videos when i say not of true not is an operator true is an operand and the result of not of true is going to be false and false is a result which explains that operands need not be two in number they can even be one in number you can even have one operator one operand in one result not of true is equal to false is a classic example of that when i say something like seven semicolon or even if i say not of true semicolon that in itself is a valid javascript program a lot of people get confused with this but this is a valid javascript program we are not assigning it to any variable we are not doing anything extra but not of true is equal to false semicolon or seven semicolon is a valid javascript program we'll now go to a computer screen and see how these concepts are useful in javascript and i'm going to create programs for you explaining all of these concepts very clearly let's get started [Music] [Applause] so with this video we are going to start operators and expressions which is going to be your chapter number two so let me open the pdf of chapter number two and we are then going to see in detail what chapter number two has to offer for us so let me also open this thing in vs code so that you can see uh where i'm making the programs and also i'm going to say zero one underscore operators underscore expressions.js okay so let's go to chapter number two and let's try to understand what chapter number two has to tell us okay so a fragment of code that produces a value is called an expression so if i if i say seven semicolon or eight semicolon this is a code which actually is a valid javascript program i'll tell you why so this is simply an expression okay if i say false this program does nothing at all but this is a valid javascript program let me tell you if i run this you'll see nothing happens but this is a valid javascript programs you see nothing happening but also you don't see any error which means this is a valid javascript program okay so what is basically happening here is we are simply writing a literal okay but we want our programs to do something because the purpose of our program is going to be something we want a program to do something for us so every value written literally is an expression so this is an expression but if we operate two expressions using an operator so basically if i say 8 plus 9 is equal to we can make javascript do this i'll explain you what operators are now so there are different types of operators in javascript one of the operators is arithmetic operators and we have assignment operators and we have comparison operators and then we have logical operators as well so let's do one thing let's try to understand arithmetic operators so let me say arithmetic operators and let me also do something like this a plus b is equal to and i'm going to say a plus b okay also i'm going to say let a is equal to 4 and let b is equal to 7 okay so 7 plus 4 is going to be 11 okay also i'm going to use different types of operators different types of arithmetic operators on these two numbers so if i do something like this let me change this to 14 okay let me change this to 15 actually so if i change this to 15 and let me change this to 3 or maybe 2 if i save you'll see that a plus b is 17 15 plus 2 is 17 a minus b is 13 a multiplied by b is 30 and a divided by b is 7.5 this is something that you should note in languages like c when we divide 15 by 2 you get 7 you don't get anything in decimal the result is also an integer the operation between an integer and integer is an integer in c language but not in javascript javascript is going to tell you exactly the value of this expression as you can see here okay now let's talk about another operator which is the modulo operator so if i do something like this a person b and if i run this you'll see that a person b is equal to 1. so this is basically telling me the remainder when we divide 15 by two this is a remainder one is the remainder if you change these numbers you are going to see something else okay i am also going to add two more things i am going to say a is equal to and b is equal to so that in the output itself you can see the value of a and b okay so if i do something like this you'll see a is equal to 15 b is equal to a plus b is there c minus b is this and so on okay now there are two more operators that i want to tell you so star star is the exponentiation operator okay so if i do something like this if i say a star star b this is actually an exponentiation exponentiation operator okay this is basically raising a to the power of b so 15 square which is going to be 225 as you can see okay so this is how this works and i hope that you are getting how all these things are working so what i'm going to do now is i'm going to explain you two operators which are plus plus and minus minus plus plus and minus minus are actually assignment operators as well as arithmetic operators because they are performing both the actions so now let me show you how these work and this is really going to be very very helpful for you for your future javascript journey if you understand how plus plus operator works so a lot of people must be thinking that why am i teaching so basic why am i not telling you the exact thing uh why am i not going to the promises call backs all the difficult stuff in javascript because this is the ultimate javascript course and this is meant for beginners okay so don't expect me to just dive into the difficult topics all the topics that in your head you are thinking that okay i'm going to teach this topic and you're waiting for the topic no i'm going to teach everything so if you stick to this course you're going to see each and every topic being dot okay with that said i'll say a plus plus prints what will it print tell me it is actually going to print the value of a which is 15 i'll tell you how this works but if i change this to plus plus a plus plus a what will happen is i'm going to comment this line out i'll tell you why i'm doing this and i'm going to explain this very very clearly so plus plus a actually increments the value of a with 1. you can see that the value of a was initially 15 but now the value of a has been changed to 16 one has been added to the value of why does this happen so if i say console.log plus plus a prints 16 why does this print 16 and this thing was printing 15 so what happens is when you say a plus plus this means that print a and then increment a print a then add 1 to a which is increment a so when i say a plus plus it will print 15 but actually it will change the value of a to the next time you print a it's going to be 16 okay after this line now plus plus a on the other hand increments first and then prints so in this case it's actually incrementing 15 to 16 the value of a now becomes 16 and 16 is being printed okay the next time you print a a is going to be 16. so this kind of operator actually modifies the value of a and at the same time it might print the incremented value of a in which case will it print incremented value of a in this case it is going to print incremented value of a but in this case it is going to print a as it is and then it is going to increment 1 to a okay i hope that this is very clear to all of you and i hope that you will be able to figure out how decrement operator works in a similar situation i want you to do one thing let's create a quiz for you okay so i want you to tell me what this prints okay and even i don't know what this prints so i want you to tell me in the comments what the output is going to be and then i'm going to discuss it so pause the video tell me what the output of this thing is going to be and then i'm going to you know tell you what the output is going to be okay so i'm waiting for your comment you can pause the video so i hope that you solve this problem and you know posted a comment so when this line actually runs the value of a becomes 16 okay and 16 is printed so i'm going to say 16 is printed and then what happens this is the value of a is now 16 minus minus a will actually bring 15 and the value of a is going to be 15. so it prints 15 and the value of a becomes 15 so this is the value of a now a minus minus the value of a becomes 14 but it prints 15 because we are actually writing a minus printer so it prints 15 first and then it changes the value of a to 14. i'll remove all these because i just wanted to type the current value of a here so this is how the output is going to be and obviously this will print plus plus a prints this is going to be printed okay let me run this a little done because this is the valid javascript program 16 15 15. so i hope that you were able to get the answer right if you weren't then believe me you need to watch this video again okay and i am very very hopeful that you will be able to understand after watching this video once again so we just talked about arithmetic operators now let's talk about assignment operators what exactly are assignment operators assignment operators simply assign a value to a variable so if you say x is equal to y it simply assigns the value of y to x when i say let b is equal to 2 equals to is an assignment operator so let me actually type this assignment operators assignment operators so if i say let c is equal to 5 this is an assignment operator now if i say c plus equals to 7 this means same as c is equal to c plus 7 okay and if i say something like this c minus equals to say 1 this is same as c is equal to c minus 1 okay so this is how this works okay c plus equals to 7 c minus equals to 1 and this is how assignment operators work so equals to you know equals to the plane equals to works the way you expect it to plus equals 2 will actually be similar to this thing x is equal to x plus 5 if you say x plus equals to 3 it means x is equal to x plus 3 if you say x minus equals to 5 it means x is equal to x minus 5 and if you say x divide equals to 7 it means x is equal to x divided by 7 if you say x percentage equals to 8 it means x is equal to x plus and 8 okay so exactly like c plus equals to 7 works c minus equals to 1 works c percent equals to c double star equals to also works okay i hope that this is very very clear to all of you so this is how assignment operator works okay talking about the comparison operators what exactly are comparison operators so comparison operators are designed to return a boolean okay either a is equal to b or a is not equal to b either c is equal to d or it's not equal to d either c is greater than zero or it's not greater than zero let me show you how comparison operators work so let me let me do something like this comparison operators let us say op1 is equal to 5 and we have var5 is equal to 8 these are random names for the variables that i've taken now if i say console dot log 5 is greater than sorry op1 is greater than 0 is it true or false is ob1 greater than 0 or it's lesser than 0 it's actually greater than 0 so true will be printed on the screen the result is going to be a boolean and also if i do something like this op1 double equals to 5 this is also true because equals 2 is an assignment operator double equals to actually checks for value being equal to this number or not so op1 double equals to five means is ob one equals to five yes it is since it is true is printed okay now if i run this program once again you will see or p one equals to equal so 51 is false okay now what's triple equal so if if i do something like this op1 triple equals to 5 listen to this very very carefully this is very important this is something that you might not know again i'm telling you so op1 triple equals to 5 means that is op1 equals to 5 or not and is the type of ob1 is also equal to number the type of op1 is also equal to the type of this literal or not is op1 a number or not both the things so if i do something like this i'll show you one example if i do something like this if i say op1 is equal to 5 if i say op1 let me comment this and let me also do something like this if i say is the value of op1 equals to 5 yes the value of op1 is equal to 5 is the value as well as type of op1 is equal to the value of this and the type of this no the type of this is integer which is a number and type of this is a string okay so these are not the same types is the type of op1 same as type of five type and value okay and i am a copy paster guys seriously i love to copy paste when i can why not copy paste when you can is the value of is the value of not type is the value of open same as value of 5 not not here not here okay so we are basically asking whether the value of op1 is equal to 5 or not okay is it the same as value of 5 now here i'm asking is the type and value of op1 same as type and value of 5 so no type of op1 is string and the type of letter 5 is number if i run this you'll see true and false i hope this is clear crystal clear okay now we have not equals to we even have not double equals to and this exactly does the same thing is the value as well as the type not equal or not so not equal value or not equal type any any one of these okay if i do something like this not double equals to let me show you if i do something like this not double equals to not equals to and not double equals to not double equals to let us say if i do something like this let me remove these comments because i wrote these comments for the previous ones so it's actually showing false and true so op1 is not equal to 5 this is false because ob1 is actually equals to 5 op1 not double equals to 5 yes this is true because the type is not matching value is matching but the type is not matching okay i hope that this is clear now greater than less than greater than or equal to less than or equal to is something that i want you to explore i am not going to tell you each operator one by one i don't want to create sample programs for each comparison operators you guys do it yourself okay as a practice set just do it as a quiz okay and do not skip this part do it try to see if you are able to print op1 is greater than i actually told you greater than so you try greater than equal to less than equal to less than okay all these operators ternary operator is something that i'm going to show you very soon so let's not talk about ternary operator right now but let's talk about logical operators what exactly are logical operators so if we have two booleans okay if we have two booleans logical operators now let us say we have two booleans let b1 is equal to true and let b2 is equal to false okay if i print b1 and b2 what is going to be printed if both of these are true true will be printed if both of these are false false will be printed if one is true one is false and false will be printed this is the and operator and means that both should be true otherwise false okay so let's also print b1 or b2 and is there any other logical operator not if i play not of b1 or not of b2 it is going to reverse okay let me show you all of these one by one if i say b1 and b2 b1 is true but b2 is false both have to be true for this to be true okay if there is an end operator if both the values are true it will print true otherwise false so it's printing false b1 or b2 at least one of these should be true then true will be printed otherwise false will be printed at least one is true b1 is true so true will be printed now not operator actually reverses the boolean value if it's true it becomes false if it's false it becomes true b1 was true so it became false okay i hope this is clear to you so these were logical operators okay now we even have bitwise operators apart from all these we also have type operators and bitwise operators type off is an example of type operator and bitwise operator is something that performs bit by bit operations we are going to see bitwise operators later in this course but for now we are going to skip how bitwise operators work it's actually very simple they convert the number to the binary form first and they uh perform the operation bit by bit okay now one thing that i want you to know is if i say 7 plus 8 is equal to 15 then 15 is the result plus is the operator and these both are operands this is something that should be clear to all of you now let's talk about comments in javascript now we are already using comments okay we are already using comments uh comment is something which is actually ignored by javascript so if i do something like this this is a comment i've actually written a comment here this will be ignored this will not be passed this will be ignored because i have double slash this is a single line comment so this is a single line comment and this is a multi-line comment okay and i can close this comment like this okay so this is a multi-line comment something like this is being displayed this program will run because this is a comment this is something that will not be executed by the javascript engine this will be ignored by the javascript engine and you can see that this is being printed on the screen okay so now a comment in javascript can be written like this i've already told you how single line comment works how multiline comments works now sometimes comments are used to prevent the execution of some lines of code so let us say you have a function and you want it to not be a part of your program so you can simply comment it out you can simply select and in most of the popular ids what you can do is simply press control plus slash and you'll be commented and once again if you press ctrl slash it will be uncommented like this so comment uncomment comment uncomment comment uncomment i hope that you are able to understand this okay so that was all about the operators expressions and comments in javascript explore the notes i have written these notes for all of you and i hope that these notes are worked well for you to understand all these things so if you haven't already access the javascript playlist make sure you bookmark this playlist and actually save this playlist as well thank you so much guys for watching this video and i will see you next time [Music] bye
lXalx9RLMlQ,which programming language to learn first let me explain the answer to this question is that there is no fixed programming language that you can learn to get maximum benefits but I can give you some suggestions and pointers if you're starting out I recommend not learning languages like kobold art other languages which are not used very often I would suggest you go for some language like C C plus plus python which are very popular I would like to suggest you some languages like python C C plus plus so that you can get some projects right after learning these languages it also depends on which stage of career you are in if you have a lot of time and you are at an early stage in your career I recommend learning CC plus plus if you don't have a lot of time and you want to quickly get started I recommend python if you want to get into data science and machine learning once again python if you want to get into web development I would recommend JavaScript irrespective of which programming language you are learning first it's always possible to learn multiple languages as you succeed I wish you all the best in your endeavors
DW7OaXN9wMs,javascript is an amazing programming language which can be used to create powerful web applications in the modern world if you don't know javascript it will be very difficult for you to create powerful web applications and become a successful web developer but on the other hand if you can master javascript it will be very easy for you to create powerful efficient and smooth web applications in this course we are going to cover all the concepts of javascript along with my handwritten notes and all the source code which we are going to write in this course will be provided to you in the description i request all of you to like this video and comment this javascript course is helpful down below this way my efforts will be able to reach a lot of students and i'll really appreciate it the first video of this course is going to be introduction to programming and a lot of you might find it unexpected to get an introduction to programming in this javascript course but when we start things from scratch the experience is really very different believe me we'll start from the basics and then we'll raise the bar like anything in our later videos i can assure you that this javascript course is going to be game changing for your carrier this is the ultimate javascript course let's get started [Music] [Applause] so the very first thing that i am going to do right now is install va score which is visual studio code let me show you how to install visual studio code all you need to do is type install visual studio code and you should see this screen simply click on download visual studio code and just download it and install it like a game on your computer i know you must have downloaded a lot of games in your computer just install it like a game after the setup is complete downloading simply click on the setup and install it like a computer game as i already told you simply accept the agreement simply click on next and the most important thing you need to check these boxes i repeat you need to check all these boxes this is really very important i'll tell you why we are checking these boxes simply click on next install and you should be good to go now note that i already have vs code installed on my machine and running the setup won't cause any harm i'll simply uh click here because i don't want to launch vs code right now i'll simply click on finish now i'll come back to this folder and you'll see two pdf files these are my handwritten notes which i'm going to supply along with this course all i'll do right now is create a folder with chapter zero chapter zero will contain the code as well as the pdf for chapter number zero and i'll also say chapter one chapter one will contain the pdf of chapter one as well as the notes of chapter one okay going back i'll simply open this folder in vs code so in order to open a folder in vs code all you need to do is press shift on your keyboard right click and click on open with code now vs code is installed on my machine which is why i'm seeing this option remember we checked those two boxes this is one of the reasons why we checked those two boxes now simply click on open with code and you will see this folder opened in ps code now if you are new to vs code no problems at all because i am going to show you everything from scratch and yes if you already know what vs code is what javascript is what programming is this chapter might be a little bit boring for you but please bear with me and if you listen to me i'm damn sure that you're going to learn something new with this chapter from the notes what is programming programming is a way to talk to computer so let us say i want to talk to you i'll use english or hindi maybe bengali spanish japanese or whatnot okay so in order to converse with somebody we need a medium that medium is the language that we are talking in in the same way in order to talk to computers we need programming language so programming is simply a way to talk to computers because we cannot use a mod to talk to computer i cannot say hey computer please record this audio and i even cannot you know show my feelings to the computer and also i cannot express my feelings to the computer i cannot say hey computer i'm feeling bad tell me what to do it's not going to tell me what to do until and unless we have programmed it to do so so computer is dumb it's very dumb it's just fast with specific stuff of calculation but otherwise it is really very dumb computer is not at all smart when when was the last time you ordered some cereal and got dvds of cereal now let us say you want to order some cereals to eat if you tell somebody hey get me some cereal i want i'm hungry i want to eat something and what if somebody gives you dvd of cereal hey this is the cereal watch it on your computer but you are hungry you will say hey i was hungry i wanted to eat the cereal i'm not talking about the tv show cereal i'm talking about the cereal which we eat so computer is a dumb machine and very similar you need to specify exactly what you want to do you need to specify hey i want to eat cereal so you need to go to the market at this particular shop get me the cereal and then only computer will be able to get the correct thing or the correct task done for you okay the programming is the act of constructing a computer program a set of precise instructions telling a computer what to do so in order to tell computer exactly what to do you need a programming language and in this course we are going to learn javascript which is a programming language used to program websites it can be used in backend it can be used in front end and what not now even you can create desktop application using electron so if i show you electron.js you can simply create desktop applications using javascript so javascript is evolving like anything now let's talk about what is ecmascript ecmascript is a standard on which javascript is based so it's basically a set of rules in which javascript is based it was created to ensure that different documents of javascript are actually talking about the same language so if we have a lot of documents and different documents are talking about the same standard in different way it is going to be a problem so this standard was built so whoever is researching on javascript wants to add new feature to the language they can simply come and add those features to ecmascript acme script is a standard on which javascript is based so anything we want to introduce to javascript we can simply introduce it in atma script standard and we are good to go now javascript and ecmascript can almost always be interchangeably used javascript is very very liberal which means that even if you are not using a semicolon or you are making some very silly mistake it will try to understand what you are trying to say and it will execute something for you instead of throwing an error and stopping everything now how to execute javascript javascript can be executed right inside one's browser so now if i want to execute javascript the fastest way for me to execute javascript is simply come to some tab simply right click and click inspect and i should be able to execute javascript in the console so if i say console.log you don't have to worry about what i'm doing i'll simply say hello word and this will be executed here and you'll see that hello world is printed on the screen i'm going to explain everything that i did here you don't have to worry about what i did here but the fastest way for me to execute javascript is right inside the browser because our browser contains javascript engine which is capable of executing javascript okay now another way to execute javascript is a runtime like node.js which can be installed in somebody's machine and they can run javascript inside of node.js now what exactly is node.js so somebody in i guess 2000 um i don't know node.js i'll show you the history of node uh let me open wikipedia and i'll show you how ryan dahl created node.js and in which year it was created so it was originally created in 2009 so what this guy basically did was he took out the javascript engine from the browser and put it inside a c plus plus program which was capable of executing javascript outside of the browser now node.js can be used to run javascript outside of the browser i'm not going to go into details of how node.js was created and all let me come back to the topic which is javascript now node.js can be used to execute javascript okay so in order to install node.js you can simply go to google and simply type install.js and this might sound haunting to some of the people because they must be like hey this is my first programming language i have never ever heard of programming and you are making me install so many programs do not worry simply install it for your operating system if you're on a mac simply install it for a mac if you are on linux you can even install node.js for linux okay now i am going to simply run this and next next next and it should simply read the license agreement i've read it believe me next next and you can simply click next do not check this simply click next and install okay now it will ask you for some permissions and you should be good to go okay now this will install node.js on my machine and i'll show you what will happen you can simply right click on your windows icon and go to windows partial and let let me close this at this point i want to wait for it to install first now it has been installed so i can simply go to partial and i can say node and i can basically use javascript here so this is a javascript runtime i can say hello like this okay so this is how we can actually run javascript outside of the browser okay i hope this was not haunting i hope everybody was able to install node.js and i hope that you enjoyed what we did in this lesson we have a long way to go a very long distance to cover but believe me this journey is going to be fantastic we'll go to the next chapter and after going to the next chapter we'll understand what variables in javascript are we are going to understand the programming basics using those concepts that we are going to learn in the coming chapters now there is one more line which i wrote here yet and the way to execute javascript is by inserting it inside script tag of an html document so if you put a javascript code inside script tags it will actually execute in the browser we are going to see all these things in the coming lessons i hope this was not haunting and i hope that you were able to understand what we did in this lesson so i'll create a javascript playlist and i'll link it in the description as well as in the pinned comment i want all of you to access that playlist so that we all are on the same page so that you are able to access the course in a very systematic manner down in the description will be links to download this pdf you can simply download this pdf and this will be all yours so yeah thank you so much guys for watching this video and i will see you next time [Music] i
zJNgK7VXp54,if you're looking for a great developer experience while storing data to the database harperdb is something you should know about hyperdb is first distributed database with hybrid sql as well as nosql functionality built into it whether you want to connect your data across tables to build relationship between them or you want to simply create json-like documents harper db is the best of both worlds one thing i love about hyperdv is its custom functions feature with this feature you can build your entire application in one place using the custom functions feature believe it's a game changer custom functions can be used to power all sort of things like integration with third-party apps creating ai ml based applications doing third-party authentication and the list just goes on also harper tv is independent of hardware and network providers so you can simply install it in your server and you should be good to go with hyperdb cloud you can even run harperdb as a managed service on the cloud i suggest all of you to give hyperdv a try link is in the description
hraAvEwZ3o4,variables are like containers which can be used to store data types i hope you have seen containers at home you have seen how containers can be used to store household items like rice sugar tea pulses etc in this video we are going to understand what variables in javascript are and why it is important to learn the concept of variables javascript is a dynamically typed language which means that we can change the type of variables at runtime in javascript if you have created an integer you can always change that variable to hold a string later if you have created a variable which is holding string right now you can always change that to hold a number in the future this is called dynamic typing on the other hand static typing is something which means that you cannot change the type of variable at runtime if you have created a variable as an integer it is an integer and you cannot make it a string you cannot store string into that variable so to summarize static typing means that you cannot change type runtime and dynamic typing means that you can change type at runtime we'll now go to our computer screen and understand the concept of variables and we are going to dive a little more deeper let's get started [Music] [Applause] so now we are going to understand what variables are and i am going to open the folder that we created in vs code in order to better structure program what i'll do is i'll go to the chapter and let me open this in vs code first and i'll show you what i'm going to do i'm going to say 0 1 underscore 0 1 means or rather 0 to underscore 0 to means video number 2 and variables dot js okay now a lot of you must be thinking how to execute a javascript program so we are going to use node.js for that so if you don't have the code runner extension code runner um so code runner is an extension which you can enable and you will get this button right here and if i say console.log hello word you will be able to execute this particular program and hello world will be printed in your console now if you think that this is not happening for you or this is not working for you for some reason you can always use replit or you can also do one more thing which i'm going to show you but i'm going to use node.js if you install nodejs along with me you will get this output just like i am getting it but again if you are not able to get it i am going to show you one more way to execute javascript all you have to do is just create an html file and exclamation mark and why is emmet not working okay it's working now what i'm going to do is i'm going to say script okay and inside of script i'll say console.log world okay now after doing this i'm going to install a live server which is an extension where is live server here is my extension okay live server so this is an extension you can always install this extension and the moment you install this extension and reload your browser what you are going to see is uh this particular go live button here just click on this go live button and you will see this just like this and you'll see nothing on the screen but in your console you'll see hello world okay now i'm going to clear all the errors it's giving me an error for fab icon but if you reload this page once again you will see hello world okay so uh all i want to tell you is if you're not able to use node.js you can always follow this method but i'm going to use node.js and i hope everybody will be able to use node.js if you have installed it just like me if you haven't installed it already just go to the previous video and install node.js and you should be good to go i'm going to delete this index.html file because i don't want it to be the part of a source code i'm going to use node.js so whatever i'm going to explain you in this video the corresponding code for that is going to go ahead okay let me open this pdf for you and after opening the pdf i'll show you what i've written inside of this so this is the chapter one of this ultimate javascript course just like we follow some rules while speaking english which is a grammar we have to follow some rules while we are writing javascript code okay i cannot simply write anything here i cannot say console.harry and hello what it's not going to print hello world it's going to tell me that console. is not a function so you have to follow a certain rule if you want to print something on the screen you need to write console.log otherwise this is not going to work okay so we need to follow some rules while we are working with the language now what is a variable it's just like a container that stores a value just like i told you a few minutes back variable is just a container assume a room and assume some space that you located for let us say keeping your gym items and let's say you have another space a wardrobe dedicated to all the items that you're going to wear you have a rack for your shoes now whatever you are keeping inside of your room you have allocated some space for that room just like we are locate some space inside of room to keep items we need to allocate some space in our memory and variable is a container that stores a value and the space that we are locating is mainly reserved for that particular thing so variable is a container that stores a value inside of a memory we can store values which can be integers it can be a floating point number it can be a string it can be arrayed it can be object it can be whatever you want now this is very similar to the containers we use to store rice water oats what have you so you can trade this as an analogy don't take it literally okay now the value of a javascript variable can be changed during the execution of a program this is something which is really very important let us say i have a variable i'll say let a is equal to 45 and the moment i say let a is equal to 45 it's going to allocate uh 45 inside of this container the name of the container is a now if i say console.log and i say a and i run this code you will see 45 is being printed on the screen what if i do a is equal to 98 right after writing let a is equal to 45 in this line it is actually creating a variable a and assigning the value 45 to it and right after that what it is doing is it is assigning the value 98 to a okay so you can always change the values you can always make your variable hold a different value at a later point in the program and you can always do something like this as well i can change the type of this variable to string this is really very important let me write it down for you in the comments you can always change the type of a variable okay you can always change the type of a variable in this case i have changed the type of the variable from a number to a string okay now this might not be allowed in all the languages if you go to c language or c plus plus you will not be able to do that a container which is supposed to store a number in c language will always store a number you need to destroy that number uh that variable and create a new variable if you want to change the type in c language but in javascript if you want to do the same thing you can always do that just like i showed you this is really very important and this is called dynamic typing okay let me write it down for you dynamic typing okay this is dynamic typing so dynamic timing is you can always change the value of a variable change the type of a variable sorry not value the type of the variable and static typing is simply you cannot change okay the type of the variable so javascript is a dynamically typed language okay let me write it down um javascript is a dynamically type language okay let me comment it down for you so this is something which is really very important uh when we say let a is equal to 7 or where a is equal to 7 you can even use var if you want to create variables but i'm going to show you the difference between var let and const in the next video so where a is equal to 7 inside of this particular statement if i try to focus what is happening let is simply a way to create a variable a is identifier when we say let a is equal to 7 let is a keyword which means that i want to create a space in the memory location and is the name of that identifier this identifier should hold value 7 and equal to his assignment operator this is the process of declaring a variable in javascript when i say let b is equal to harry let us say i say let b is equal to harry i am saying that create a memory location with name b and store the string inside of that memory location so this is how variables work in javascript okay but can i do something like this i'll show you something so let us say i say let 56 c is equal to harry or harry too what is happening here why is it showing me errors it is showing me address because there is a set of rules which applies while you choose a variable name this will throw an error okay because you cannot start because of the number in the variable name because variable name cannot start with a number not because of the number if i if i change it to a 56 it will work variable can contain a number but it cannot start with the number because variable name cannot start with the number okay so this is actually github covalent which is suggesting me all this code this is really very helpful when i'm typing the code but let me comment this line because if you run it you will get an error and i don't want that okay now coming back to the rules for choosing variable names you can always have letters you can have digits you can have underscores you can even have a dollar sign inside of your variables but it must begin with either a dollar or an underscore or a letter it cannot start with a number it cannot start with a pound symbol if i try to do something like this let pound a is equal to 7 no you cannot do that okay this will throw an error okay now the third rule says that javascript reserved words cannot be used as a variable name if i do something like this let class is equal to 1 no i cannot do that class is a reserved word or if i do something like this let var is equal to 1 no i cannot do that let const is equal to 1 no i cannot do that okay so this is something that you cannot do because there are some of the keywords which are reserved in javascript and you cannot use reserved keywords while declaring variables in javascript okay now harry and harry are different variables this particular variable and this particular variable are both different they both are different variables javascript variables are case sensitive because when you are actually using h a capital r r y you are using a different variable and when you are using capital h r and y this is a different variable this is treated as a completely different variable because when you say capital h r y and you say hry you can always distinguish between these two because this one contains capital h this one contains small h but it is recommended that you don't mess up with the variable names like this do not create two variables with the same name in different case because it will cause a lot of confusion in your program so this is a suggestion from my side in the next video what i'm going to do is i'm going to explain you the difference between where let and const and it is going to be a very interesting video because i'm going to show you why let var and const are there in javascript and why you should use which one and when okay so this is something that we are going to discuss in the later videos if you haven't already accessed the notes and source could please do that because i have written these notes for you and i want all of you to access these notes also make sure that you access the playlist and bookmark it and also save it thank you so much guys for watching this video and i will see you next time [Music]
6o8SL23h_xY,in this video we'll see how to use a total to perform multi-dimensional analysis using python although we can analyze any kind of data but i am going to use a sample sales data in a csv file to start this multi-dimensional analysis using a toti we will see how to read the sales data and start analyzing it using autot and most importantly why you should use auto to analyze this data in multi dimension multi-dimensional analysis is really helpful when you have huge data and you want to analyze it in multi dimensions one cool features about autot is that it gives you a web application which can be used to analyze your data and deep digger into your data that two in multi dimensions let's go to the computer screen and we'll get started with analyzing our data using a totee so i'm inside of my computer screen and the mission of this video is going to be to explain you a totee in a very simple way so that you can start analyzing your data and view your data with a different perspective so what i'll do is i'll open a totee documentation so if you simply type a total documentation in your browser you can simply click on the 2t dot io website you will be taken to this page you can simply go to installation and i'm also opening the tutorial side by side which i'm going to follow now let me tell you about this tutorial this tutorial basically loads a sales data and then it starts analyzing and derive multiple insights from it using a doty so let's come to the installation first in order to do the installation all i'll do is i'll press shift right click and open the powershell window and after i open the powershell window i'll simply write pip install a totally jupyter lab but before i run this command i want to show you what it exactly means but before that let's install a tortilla so let me come to this page let me copy this command and after i paste this command and run it it is going to install the latest version of a toti as well as the auto jupiter lab extension so let me show you something when you type paper install auto t and you type jupiter lab in the square brackets we are basically saying installer totally as well as the jupiter lab extension from auto now there are a lot of other extensions from autot you can go to plugins page i can you know search for plugins in the documentation and i can go to this page and after i go to this page here are some of the available plugins which can be installed simply by adding their names in the square bracket after pimp install auto you can see the syntax but we are interested in the jupiter lab extension as of now so i'm installing a toti along with the jupiter lab extension so far so good we have installed the toti the latest version of doty is installed and also we have the jupiter lab extension of auto so what i'm going to do is close this reference or maybe i'll keep it open and come to the tutorial and i'm going to run this command now what this command is going to do is this will give you a tutorial folder which will contain a sample ipython notebook as well as the sales data which we are going to analyze using a toti so i will simply you know open windows powershell which is already open here i'll issue this command and after i run this command you can see that a new folder is created tutorial let me close this powershell window and let's try to see what is inside of this tutorial there is some sales data there is i buy the notebook there are some of the images here so let's do one thing let's open this folder in partial and let's type jupyter lab now do not use jupyter notebook and you must use jupiter lab in order to leverage the auto extension for jupiter lab some of the people might use jupiter notebook it will work sometimes but you will not get the powers of this jupiter lab extension from adobe so it's highly recommended that you use jupiter lab and not jupiter notebook let's create a new ipython notebook i'll create a new ipython notebook i'll simply click here and let me rename this to a toti tutorial so i'll say a toti [Applause] dot ipython notebook and this is a fresh ipython notebook which has been opened okay now what i'm going to do is come to the tutorial and i'll copy this i'll import a toti as td and then i'll create a new session now what is the session in order to analyze my data using a doty i need to create a 2d session now once the session is created i can always do session dot read csv to read data now there are multiple ways to read data in a doty this particular command is saying there is a csv file inside data called sales.csv open that file and the keys with which we want to open this wireless sales id so if i press shift enter and if i say sales table dot head so here we have the first five rows from our data set you can see that we have sale id as our key and we have uh you know date shop product quantity unit price as some of other columns so we have read using a csv file but what if we have a data frame ready for us we can always read data in different ways using a total let me search for read pandas so if i write read in the search of adobe you can always press ctrl k by the way in order to search something in the 20 documentation you can do read csv you can do read numpy you can do read pandas you can do read spark read parkway there are a lot of ways i'll show you read pandas before we move on and this is how you can read a pandas data frame if you have a data frame ready if you are already analyzing your data using pandas and you want to use auto you can always pass data frame inside of free pandas method and you can do the similar things that i'm going to show you okay so we have our sales data ready we have already seen the sales data now what i'm going to do is create a cube now this is a concept that you need to understand and listen to me very very carefully when i explain this a cube inside of autot is a way to look data in multiple dimensions let me create this cube this cube is created and let me walk you through some of the multi-dimensional concepts a cube is a multi-dimensional view of some data it can be any data in our case this is the sales data which we have created the cube of now we can easily explore aggregate we can perform a lot of operations run queries on this data but why do we want to analyze this in multi-dimensions why have we created a cube because we want to see a data from a different perspective we want to see in how many which was a day where we sold the maximum product let us say or which is a product which is performing the best in our e-commerce store so these are the kind of insights that we want to derive from our data let's understand what is a hierarchy in a cube so we have already understood that cube is a multi-dimensional view of some data it's just a way of looking at a data now access of this cube are called hierarchies the max human eye can look at is three dimensions but we can have multiple dimensions or rather multiple dimensional cube to analyze our data now the access of these of the cube is hierarchies in this case product shop and date are the hierarchies we have product as a hierarchy we have shop as a hierarchy and we have data as the hierarchy we might have even more hierarchies but in this case we have only three hierarchies now let's try to understand what are majors majors are basically numerical indicators where we can you know have a look at numerical data we can see how many uh you know uh what is the mean of the product sold what is the sum of the products sold and all sort of numerical computations can be done using measures so it is very safe to say that all the categorical columns in our data are going to take the form of hierarchies and all the numerical data points in our data are going to take the form of measures now we have hierarchies we have majors if i ask you in this case we have date shop and product as our hierarchies and quantity and unit price as our measures let us try to run this command and let us see what we get when we run cube dot hierarchies no surprises no prizes to guess we have date per product sales id and shop as our hierarchy sales sale id is also a hierarchy because this is also one of the categorical columns in our data now if i run l is equal to cube dot levels but before that let me run m is equal to cube dot majors to show you that measures are numerical data so we have the mean sum and all of these things but let me come back to the you know totally documentation you know hierarchies in a total are made of levels and levels of the same hierarchy are attributes with a parent child relationship so it's basically a drill down you have geography inside of geography you have a country and inside of country you have a city and so on so you can have multiple levels while analyzing data so i have done l is equal to q dot levels we have majors let's try to run something called a query so if i do something like cube dot query m quantity dot sum you can see that it has summed all of these things and shown me over here so these are only five rows from our data but data consists of a lot of rows so when we add the quantities across all the rows we'll get this number but this doesn't give us any good insight right so let us try to get some better insight from our data let's try to run this query which simply shows us which shop has sold how many number of products but i have not ran this l is equal to cube.levels i need to do this so let me copy this there is a copy button by the way i can use this so uh if i do shift enter you can see that i have quantity dot sum for all the shops now this is a better insight from the state i can see that shop zero has sold these many quantities shop 15 has sold these many quantities and i can see which shop is doing the best by simply analyzing this data before we move further i want to show you one more thing if i do something like df is equal to let me do something like this i'll say df is equal to q dot query and quantity dot sum the same thing i can simply do type of df and this is not a pandas data frame it's in a 20 query result if i do something like this df is equal to df dot reset index and if i do type of df now this is a pandas data frame as you can see so this is something that you need to know if you want to convert your autoquery result into a pandas data frame you can simply run df.reset index now let's try to run some more queries i'll come back to the documentation and let me run this one i'll run this one let me copy this one and i'll paste it here and shift enter and you can see that in this query i'm simply saying that i want to see quantity dot sum across dates and products so we have a date we have a product and we have quantity sum now this is even better inside because i can see that on which date which product was sold for how many quantities i can see that bet 26 was sold for six quantities on this date and this product was sold for sex on this date and so on so this is even a better insight for me if i want to say visualize this i can do something like session dot visualize and i'll show you what it does it simply visualizes your session inside of a totally now what does this mean you can simply click on say quantity dot sum and you can simply click on date and you can see on which date how many sales were made in order to verify that this is the total you can simply select this data and you can see the sum you can see the minimum maximum average count and count of numbers so sum is 2412 and the minimum is you know this thing maximum is this thing i think i have not selected the entire data so i'll i need to select the entire data and then the sum will match eight zero seven seven and this total is eight zero seven seven let me see what is the maximum number out of all these 271 is the maximum number out of all these minimum is 265 and average is this count is this these are 30 numbers and count of numbers is 30. so this is a great way to analyze your data simply by you know selecting it and seeing what is the average what is the you know all other numerical measures like uh maximum minimum and so on now let's go a step further and start taking the shops inside of our data if i drag shop over here inside of date what will happen is this will show me a drill down i can see which date on which date which shop made how many sales and i can even go further and you know drill it drill down by sale id so i've simply dragged the sale id over here and i have i can see that uh this is what i see now i can always close this and i can um you know make it once again i can say date and then i can say shop and then i can say shop sale id okay so i can get this this sort of drill down always let me close this i actually wanted the date and then the shop not here i want to drag the shop here so that it is a hierarchy inside of you know date and then i want sale id inside of my shop so this is how i can you know get nested hierarchy using a toti so i can see on which date which shop made how many sales with which sales sale id i can even see the sale id where this particular sale was performed apart from visualizing like this you can always click on this pivot table and you can see the line chart so i can see that on which shop sorry on which date which shop with which sale id performed how many sales you can see i can hover over the data points and i can see exact details of this data point i can always change this let us say i want date over quantity dot sum that on which date how many products were sold i can always see using this line chart and switch back to the pivot table and i can right click here and click on publish in app and i can actually see this web application which auto provides this is amazing because a totee provides you a web application where you can create a new dashboard or a new folder and you can even access this dashboard by writing session dot link shift enter and here is a link to the dashboard so anyway you can go to the dashboard you can simply right click and do publish in app and this particular thing will be published inside of your dashboard so let me do one thing let me create a new dashboard this is my first dashboard and i can you know go to my widgets and get this pivot table this particular table which i have published to the app so i can directly publish this to my dashboard that is the web application that roti provides you let me go to the home of the dashboard it wants me that your data is not saved now i can delete this dashboard and create new folders for multiple users let us say harry wants to use this dashboard and he can you know keep all his dashboards inside of this folder let us say lavish wants to use his dashboard he can simply put all his analysis inside of this folder and so on so let's say i want to create a new dashboard inside of harry folder i can simply say create new dashboard and i can even create more folders inside of my harry folder so this is something that you can do let us say i want to find a winning product for my sales data i want to see which product is performing the best i can always create a line chart and in my line chart what i can do is simply add uh on which date i can add product as well as unitprice.sum but i can see what the total worth or the sum of unit price of this particular product is also for this particular product or for this for instance we can see what the sum of unit prices so we we can have these kind of analysis inside of a total dashboard now if i give a title to this dashboard let us say a toti first dashboard and if i press enter this will actually save this dashboard so if i take you to the dashboard home uh if i take you inside of harry this actually saves this dashboard now once you have given a name to the folder you can simply share it with a lot of other people in your network you can host this dashboard inside of your network and you can give this link to your colleagues and peers and they can you know access your dashboard and access the same application so this is how you can share a total dashboards within a network or even host it on the internet you know if people have the proper access they will be able to access the dashboard now i can even go to the product and drag it to the widget filter and then click on advanced and i'll simply say that quantity dot sum uh is the highest and let us say i'll i want to keep five or six whose quantity dot sum is the maximum in my data if i apply the filter i'll be able to see that these are the five values and this is the average of these five values is the maximum this is the minimum so all these kind of insights can be drawn from the dashboard now if i drag this filter inside of the dashboard i can always say that i want to select the members of this state or let's say i want to select the members of this state as well as the you know this state as well as this state now since i have this advanced filter applied uh this thing is not working so i'll simply close this and if i add more dates now you know even more rows will be added to my data so i can apply this quick filter and this is also one of the things i like about it roti before we conclude this video i want to show you that you can even drill through this you know particular row and you'll see a lot more about this data so if i do drill through i can see on which date this particular bed was sold for how many quantities and so on so i hope you liked the 2t and you were able to understand all the kind of analysis that we did in this video i hope that this video was helpful for all of you if you like this video make sure you check out the description install it inside your system and try to analyze it using your data because if you analyze it on your data you are going to understand it even better because you understand your data you know better than anybody else so thank you so much guys for watching this video and i will see you next time [Music] you
fpWfFghWVp4,in this video we are going to Deep dive into the request module of python we are going to see how this module is practically used to create complex requests how you can retrieve and pass data from different web applications and process it right into your Python program this video is going to talk all about these things let's move on to our computer screen and let's get started now the very first step that you must follow in order to use request module is installation of python but I know that you will have python installed if you are watching this video so I'll go ahead and install the request module so all you need to do is type pip3 install requests okay now a lot of people will face some issues if they are on Windows if they type pip install request so I always recommend use pip 3 because pip 3 will directly install it I already have this module installed which is why it is showing me requirement already satisfied I'll fire my pycharm CE which is an IDE it's one of the best Ides for Python and I'm I'm going to create a new project and let me name this project as requests module and I'm going to use Python 3.11 previously configured interpreter you can you know simply go for system interpreter and click on create once you click on create you will see this screen pycham will give you the starter code I however don't need this starter code so why should we use request module at the first place if you are trying to automate something if you are trying to do something with python which involves Network requests you can always do the same using request module in python or let us say you want to scrape some data and you want all that data to be written to a CSV file or maybe to a database you can always do that by using request module the very simple usage of request module is you import request module and simply do request dot get before I get further in this video I want to let you know that I have teamed up with IP Royal to bring you a very special coupon code of 30 off their Royal residential proxies make sure to try them out before the offer expires so there are countless of reasons why a business must be interested in doing some data scraping one of the very common use cases is bringing all the data from different places to one place and doing analysis on top of that data efficient and accurate web scripting is not possible without the help of what residential proxies picking the right proxy solution will help you get the data from the right sources in right amount of time which can further help your business IPL provides a constant stream of fresh IPS for all sorts of web crawling projects being able to routinely replace your IP addresses with new one anywhere in the world makes your greater Gathering efforts indistinguishable from genuine visitors IPL has a massive pool of residential IEPs which you can always use to do web scrubbing and speed up your data collection the best part about IP Royal is that this support is available 24 7 which is a plus so you can use the code Harry during checkout and you will get 30 discount on IP Royal make sure to check it out in order to get started with the request module we'll make a very simple get request to google.com if you go to google.com this is what you see but this is not exactly what browser retrieves if you go to view page Source you'll see this this is the source code of this page if I come back to my python IDE I can always do requests.get and I can give this URL which is google.com and then I can print r dot text now what is our RS what is returned by request.get if you print r dot text you can run this and you will get the source code of this page this was the very basic web scrubbing which you can possibly do now let me come back to my Google Chrome and show you some more use cases so if I Google search requests you can go to request documentation HTTP for humans this is how requests documentation looks like so let us say I have this R is equal to request dot get and I want to authenticate with GitHub API or let me show you another API Json placeholder now this is a sample API which we can use to test or get requests let me copy this URL this is simply sending a get request to the server if I do the same thing with I'll right click and click on soft wrap so that I don't see the horizontal scroll bar as you can see this returns this which means that this data is being returned from the server now what is the type of this data let us check and the type of data let me tell you is going to be a string which means that you will have to pass it as Json if you want to use it as Json or python dictionary okay all right so far so good let us now try to explore more about request module if you come to the request modules documentation the best page about request module is a quick start this is the quick start page which we want to explore and we'll be exploring the topics one by one from this quick start page if you scroll down you'll see everything is written on this quick start page for you to get started with request module for example I can make this basic request let me copy this let me paste it here and if I do this and if I print r dot text you'll see that oops I'm actually printing the type of this I want to get the data this is what I get now if I control click which means if I try to see the data on my browser I'll see this this is what it returns okay so this is the quick start page which I recommend you have a look at and understand how request module Works should you have any doubt you can always come back to this page and this page will most probably have answer to your question now if you want to add some request parameters to your get request for example let us say I want to visit this URL but programmatically let me show you something if I copy paste this this is what it returns now HTTP bin.org is a very interesting website let me tell you what it returns is your request as it is which means that you can test your request it can be a post request it can be a put request as you can see here is a documentation of this HTTP bin.org you can always test different methods you can go to http window.org delete all these are different type of requests delete is used to delete something get is used to fetch some data patch is used to send patches post is used to send post parameters if you have a lot of data you want to post something then put is used to create something on the server you can always use all these methods in this case we used slash get and we pass this key is equal to Value I can always pass more parameters by saying Harry is equal to good and as you can see key Val is there in arcs if I visit this URL Harry good is also there in aux which means that whenever I'm adding query parameters to my get request they'll be visible here let's try this using uh python okay now one argument that you might have is why can't we do something like this like simply send this request and paste the oops I click the wrong button I meant to click the Run button okay as you can see that Harry Gordon key Val is there but what if these parameters are Dynamic you can always use f strings but there is another way to do this you can say R is equal to request dot get and then you can add this payload let me add this payload and I'll say params is equal to payload so let's add this payload comma params is equal to payload now if I run this program you'll see that value 1 and value 2 all these payload parameters are present in the response okay so this is how you can send get request with parameters using request module now let's try to send a post request with some data okay so instead of saying request dot get will do request dot post and let me tell you how to send the data you can always say data is equal to your data and your data will be posted to the server you must be thinking that why am I sending the request to the same website HTTP bin.org STD build.org post is simply simulating an endpoint which accepts post request okay params is equal to payload I'll say data is equal to payload this time okay but let me do something so that we also Preserve the code because I have to give you the code by the end of this video okay but you can always take the code from the quick start guide so that should not be a problem okay R is equal to request dot post http.org post data is equal to payload let's see what r dot text returns auto text will return this form and this will tell me that hey you have actually given me a post request the type of this request is post and this is the data that I received okay you can always use an actual server here let me tell you once again and you can use data is equal to your payload whatever you want to send to the server and that should be able to post your data to that server endpoint okay so this is how you send a post request you can always add more parameters to this payload and you can always generate these payloads dynamically now let's see how we can use other type of requests so there are a lot of different type of requests like a get request is one post request is one put request is one delete request is one head request is one so all these requires have different use cases you can always do request.port delete head options and you should be able to get the required data let me know one thing let me copy all this code and if I paste it here I'll show you all these one by one let me comment all these first let me show you the put request if I run this you'll see that this is actually going through and asks this data this files is the put request is going through and you can try a bunch of other request types that should work okay another important use cases of request module is downloading files it's very easy to download files using requests let me show you how so if I press enter let me create a new python file because this one is getting very bloated so let me see R files.py and let's print this now for this you'll have to install pillow module I'll come to terminal pip 3 install pillow which is a module and this will install pillow module awesome so this is installing pillow module okay nice now we can download an image I'll show you how to download image so if you want to download an image you can say import request first and let me move this towards the top and R is equal to request dot get the URL to the image let's see if we can find an image from the Internet oops image image yes I want this image open link open image in new tab I'll copy the link to this image okay images Dot and splash.com let's see if I can get the data and let's run this program so the moment I run this program I'll have to actually right click and run this program because I'm on pycharm SO the moment I run this program I can open an image now to save this image I'll say FP is equal to open and let us say image.jpg and let's write it as bytes and now I can say I dot save FP and this should be able to save this file so as you can see image.jpg is saved here so I can use request module to download images from the internet okay so this is how you can download images from the internet you can also download files in a very similar Manner and any file type will work if you want to download it another interesting use case is to stream the files what does streaming means let's say we have a large file and we want to download it part by part how do we do that let me take you to jetbrain spy charm website pycharm let me download python oops I wanted to download pycharm okay let me copy the link to this download or let me simply click here and this this should generate uh a pH it will allow me to download it let me copy this link copy link address I'll cancel this download I already have pie charm let's try to stream the file let me read a new file called stream file dot py this will create this will simply create a file and I should be able to let me soft wrap it just so that I can show you what I'm typing import requests so in order to stream all you need to do is say R is equal to request dot get say URL and then stream is equal to true now you are streaming the file instead of actually downloading it if you come back to the documentation of request you'll see that you can say R is equal to request dot get stream is equal to true and you can start reading the content of that URL okay now in order to download it part by part you can also specify a chunk size which is in bytes and in this case you can see that the chunk size is 128 byte you can always change it to your liking and I'm going to say by charm.dmg as the file name and I'm writing the content as binary and the chunk size is 128 okay now let me do one thing I'll print I'll say print I uh let me say I am downloading I am downloading part number let me write an F string here let's say I I okay I is equal to 0 and we are going to enumerate uh sorry we are going to say I is equal to I plus 1 and and I know that I have to put this inside the loop okay right after ft dot right all right this should work so we are opening a file called pycharm.dmg we are writing it and we are specifying a chunk size of 128 let's run it so as you can see that it is actually downloading it part by part part by part part by part and definitely this print statement will take a lot of time but let me comment this so that this can happen peacefully but let me cancel it because this is a very huge file I guess and will take a lot of time for it to download it let me delete this file first of all and delete anyway I want to delete it and let me run this program and I'll wait for this file to rather this program to fully execute and then I'll be back all right so I just downloaded this file and as you can see that python.dmg is here let's try to execute it and let's see if we can actually execute it let me right click here now I can right click this file open in finder okay and I can double click this file and as you can see that this is downloaded successfully now the another question that a lot of you might have is how do I exactly know the size the total size of this file you can always print r dot headers let me do print r dot headers and it's not download the content let's just do r dot headers and let's comment this out and let's see how it goes so if I say r dot head you can see that we have this content length header I can say r dot headers content length and this should give me the length of this file okay okay so now I'm going to create a downloader which will tell me what percent of this file is actually downloaded so let's see how it goes okay so let me create a variable called total and total is going to be the total bytes and now what I'll do is I'll say uh total is equal to Total plus length of length of what length of Chunk and let me place this line here okay so this will add it to the total and after every iteration I will print an F string and I'll say uh total out of uh or rather let me say total expected is equal to this this is the expected total amount of bytes that we are expecting to receive and this is the total amount of bytes actually received and this much out of this much received or rather we can even say this much divided by total expected multiply by 100 multiplied by this divided by this percent of total expected divided by thousand uh which will create it to uh okay so one byte megabytes okay so MB received all right fingers crossed okay so it says that total expected um unsupported operands for n ten string so what is and and what is string okay so this is a string that's interesting we'll have to convert it to an integer okay so let's run it and it says one percent receive two percent received four percent received five percent received I'll have to round it actually it's not looking very good but yeah we just made a downloader which actually keeps track of the progs amazing man amazing let me cancel this and I'll show you something I'll show you something um there is a package called TQ DM in Python very interesting TQ DM and tqdm is I hope I've spelled it correct I used a long bag actually so all you need to do is PIP install PQ DM oops three installed PQ DMT qdm oops uh I'll say windows a and pip 3 and TQ DM they should install it oops I already have tqdm wow amazing amazing man from dqdm import dqdm and all I need to do is do TQ DM of whatever I want okay let's try this this is actually amazing and I'll show you what it does just wait for a bit uh for Chunk in this and let's not print anything and see the magic so you can see that it is showing me how many iterations have finished and how much time it is expecting or rather how much time has passed since it started running or it's honestly speaking I was facing some issues with tqdm but this stack Overflow answer saved me okay so I'll not discuss a lot about this I'll simply link the stack Overflow answers somewhere here and this should help you okay so what I did was I said with tqdm total is equal to Total expected divided by 128 why did I do this because this is the number of times my for Loop is going to run as P bar and then I'm doing P bar dot update let me see what what happens if I don't do p bar uh dot update if I do this this will show up like this but I don't want it to show up like this I want it to show up like this like this okay and this looks pretty good as you can see that it is showing me the percentage seven percent downloaded eight percent downloaded nine percent downloaded amazing so this is how you can actually create a downloader which shows you progress in Python okay amazing this is pretty interesting now I'll stop this and I hope that you understood how to create a downloader using python request now let's see how we can use proxies with request so I'm going to create a new file called proxy let me get a new file called proxy test always make sure that the file you are creating is not the name of any built-in module or any kind of module because that might hamper the way your python script is running and we don't want it let me import requests or rather let me come back to this website and let me go to the request documentations once again and let's see how we can use uh proxy with request so I'm going to search for proxy let me see how okay so we have proxy support okay let me Google search it requests proxy and I got some stack Overflow answers and yes this is how you use proxy with request so it's pretty simple and straightforward I think this should be there in documentation as well I'm not sure where it is but again we just found it and I'm glad I found it okay so I'm going to import request import request HTTP proxy https proxy and I'm going I'm going to use these both proxies and let me hard code them let me remove this and I'm going to hard code them okay this is going to be my HTTP proxy and this is going to be my https proxies I'm I'm going to replace it with my actual proxy and I'm not going to use any header and let me Google search some way to find my IP IP address IP address API yes IP address API I want to see what my IP address is okay so they have some plans API Dot ipi5.org okay and ipapi.com let me see how this looks ipapi.com query so if you give IP address to them they are going to send back you these details I want to visit this okay this is free which is amazing so let's see how we can directly get the IP address IPI 64 Dot ipify.com will give me an IP address let me send the request here and let's print r dot text now where do we get the proxy from I'm going to use IP Royal so let me open IP Royal IP Royal and let me open IP Royal and let me log into my IP Royal account so I just logged into my IP Royal account I'll come to dashboard and let's see where we can use the proxies I'll come to Royal residential proxy I have 4.98 GBS in my account so I'm going to Simply copy one of the bloxies and I'll copy this and I'm going to paste it here okay let me use this command first because I want to see what this command will return enter and yes it is returning me something let me make a little bit bigger and show it to you you can see that the state is California and countries us amazing everything is good so let me do one thing let me find a format which will work with python username colon password at the rate hostname colon Port works with python so I'm going to copy this let me copy and also I'm going to paste it here like this http colon double slash and I'm going to try it I'm going to click right click and run and it says host API 64.ipi5.org this is uh not working let me see what's wrong let me also specify https proxy because https proxy was wrong let me now run this program and again I see an error one thing that I got to know about IP Royal was that they use their proxy on HTTP which means that https proxy will also be HTTP and if I run this program now this should return me the IP uh okay so this is returning me this should return me the IP alright so it gave me this IP address let me see what this IP address is about you can also use this in Python by sending a request but again I'm going to test it right inside my browser okay so it says fail SSL unavailable for the endpoint members.ipi.com okay so let me check it somewhere else uh check IP I think we'll have to get some API key from here uh you know to check other IPS but again let me simply look up this IP address here get IP details yes so this is an IP from France State Paris sorry City Paris State I led France all right so IP is working sorry proxy is working okay so this is how you use proxy in Python now I'll tell you about how you can do web scraping and take your request knowledge further I'm going to show you that now in order to scrape a website you will have to first get the HTML code of that website and that will be done using request module just like we saw now let me go to um PS4 module and this will give me beautiful soups documentation now what is beautiful soup let me tell you if you type pep ins oops pip 3 install bs4 this will install a module called Beautiful soap now beautiful soup is a web scrubbing model it is used for web scrubbing I'll show you how let's say I want to scrape a website and let's say this is the website that I want to scrape iproil.com IP royal.com let's say I want to scrape this website royal.com okay 100 transparent proxy Service uh let's copy this first and I'm going to use the same page because I want to use random IP address to scrub this webpage okay let me replace this with or rather let me not replace it but let me create a copy of this and comment the previous request dot get call https ipl.com r dot text let me write it to an HTML file okay so I'll say with open and index dot HTML I'm going to write it and I'll say as F and F dot write r dot text okay let's run it all right so I just copied and pasted this and as you can see I just got a file here called index.html so I just entered a URL called https codeword.com and I'm using these proxies let me run this and as you can see index.html file is created here and I expect the content of codeweathery.com to be there on this website let us say I want to get this this particular text I'll right click I'll click on inspect and as you can see that this is a paragraph and which class is this let me find a class this is the class mt2 and what else is there to uniquely targeted I'm going to copy and I'll copy full X path of this element okay now as you can see index.html has the website content now in order to scrap data from bs4 model what we do is we say from bs4 import Beautiful soap and we create a soup now soup means a soup of a web page so beautiful soup Works on the concept of soup soup means that you have a web page and you are converting it to a beautiful soup object so I'll say soup is equal to beautiful soup and I'm going to say r dot text and I'm going to say HTML dot parser okay and let me find out all the links I'll say for a or other uh for Link in a soup dot find all find all and I'm going to find all a and I'm going to print link okay now why did we do this why did we write it to a file because at times when I'm doing web scrubbing what I do is I write all the content I scrape all the content first write it write all the content to the files and then I go ahead with uh you know the actual web scrubbing because once I have the content I can do anything with that content I need the proxy just to get all the content so as you can see that we have this this this all the links of the page and we can also say print link dot href because we might at times be interested in just the link okay so you can see that it is getting oops it says link dot href is none so I'll say find attribute or rather uh link dot get attribute yeah this should this should do link dot get attribute and href not sure if this is going to work but let's see I want to search for it you know there's no shame in searching for something how to get attribute in PS4 and as you can see that somebody has said you can use dot get method dot get okay let me use dot get let's wait for this to finish first okay so this did not work let's see if link dot get works or not I'm waiting for it let's see what happens all right so as you can see that I got all the links from codeweathery.com so this is how you can scrape specific content from a particular website in this case I scraped all the links from beautiful soup.com sorry codeweathery.com using Beautiful soap now I will go to beautiful soups documentation and we'll see how you can learn Beautiful soap BS for dogs and bs4 docs are very nice you can go to the beautiful soup documentation and you will find how you can use beautiful soup to get the page title to get a particular tag just like we scraped all the links from the page you can always scrape specific part or parts of a web page okay so you can definitely explore beautiful so but let me know if you want a dedicated tutorial on Beautiful soap I'll create that as well I hope that you like this video if you did let me know in the comments and if you want the beautiful soup tutorial let me know that as well now before I wrap up the video I would like to show you how you can apply the coupon code to get the discount so I've entered my credentials I'll solve the captcha and I'll log into my account the next thing you want to do is click on Royal residential proxies and simply click on create new order and if you apply the coupon code Harry and click on apply you are going to get flat 30 discount as you can see the message coupon was applied has been flashed on the screen giving you a total of 30 discount so go ahead and if you you want to purchase the proxy make sure to use the coupon code Harry so I hope you understood how the quest module can be used to get the data make a post request or different type of requests and how you can do streaming of files using request on python also we saw how you can perform web scrapping using Python and request using beautiful soup that was all about this video thank you so much guys for watching this video and I will see you next time foreign [Music]
qHB2jUvAlGo,welcome to this complete html course with handwritten notes html is the language of the web and it is something that you will have to learn if you want to make beautiful websites html is the very basic of web development and once mastered with css and javascript you will have tons of opportunities in different fields we are living in a digital era where everybody needs a website and the demand of beautiful fast and amazing looking website is increasing day by day my name is harry and i will be your instructor throughout this course we'll start from the very basic of html and then we'll raise the bar like anything we'll learn all those stacks which maybe some of you have not even ever heard about but we are going to learn about them and we'll use them throughout the projects that we are going to do in this course not only that we are also going to discuss search engine optimization in this course we are going to learn about different metrics which can be used to make your website rank higher in google by giving a better experience to your users the prerequisite of this course is nothing but just your time you just have to come with your time and i am here to take care of the rest of the things if you really like this initiative i want you guys to like this video and write a comment for me saying that this html course is helpful that would mean a lot to me so please take a moment to do that also this course has been divided into different chapters so that is easier for you to grasp the concepts and along with all the chapters i have written handwritten notes as well as the practice set which will be available to you as pdf not only that i'll also be supplying you two formats of the cheat sheets the first one is the pdf format and the other one is the web format so that all the commands that you want to use in html is a single click away along with that i have also time stamped this video so that you can come back to this course at the appropriate chapter at the appropriate practice set where you previously left off while you are revising you can also skip few parts of the video and focus on the things that you want to revise i understand that time stamping is really important for you all the projects that we are going to do in this course can be added to your github profile feel free to add all these projects to your github profiles and they will definitely enhance your portfolio so enough of talks now let's get started so i have written some handwritten notes in the form of five chapters for you and all these notes are going to help you a lot when it comes to revising html and even when it comes with understanding this is going to help you a lot believe me so this is the chapter number zero which gives you the basic introduction of what html is why html is needed and what css and javascript has to do when it comes to web pages and websites so let's get started with html what exactly is html html stands for hyper text markup language it is a language of the web it is something that you need to you know get your websites up and running it is used to create websites we use html text to define look and feel of a website so when you open youtube.com or when you open github.com or any other website for that matter that website looks the way it looks just because of the html it is rendering this website looks this way just because of the html it is rendering then what is the role of css and javascript should be the question that you might ask so let's let's take all of these one by one so we use html tags to define look and feel of a website what exactly is an html tag let me show you something let us say you have this website or any website for that matter if you right click and click on view page source you'll see the source of that website that source is nothing but the html code of that website the moment you go to the source code of some website you'll see these kind of tags now we'll look into all these tags one by one very soon but this is html this is something that you need to know this stack this a tag this p tag this li tag this ul tag all these tags are nothing but part of this html document okay now then why it's css and javascript you must be thinking that if html can get the job done why do we need css and javascript yes html can get the job done it can give you a basic web page it can give you a very basic layout but again if you want to design the layout if you want to make it look good you need css css is used to design a web page now okay so we have the web page we have the design of the web page we should be good right html for layout of the web page and css for the design of webpage why do we need javascript then should be your next question and this is what i'm going to answer now so html is used for defining the layout of a page a bare bone page structure so html simply tells that here there is something which is going to be an image here another image is going to come here some heading is going to come then another heading is going to come then some input tag is going to come now css will decide where this input tag will be aligned with the spec to the web page where this particular portion of the website will be aligned with respect to the web page which heading is going to appear before which heading all these things can be controlled using css also the background color of a page the color of the text and the font of the text the font size of the text all these things can be controlled using css so css is used to add styling to the bare bone page which was created using html so i hope that the role of css and html are clear to you html for the bare bones css for designing and defining how a particular page looks okay so we have the bare bones we have the designing what about javascript why do we even need javascript should be your next question so javascript is used to program logic for the page layout what does this mean this means that javascript is going to control what happens when a user hovers on a text what will happen when somebody clicks on a link what will happen when somebody selects a piece of text what will happen when somebody say right clicks or say clicks on something or say brings their mouse inside of a box so all these things can be controlled using javascript so javascript is used to program the client-side logic of the page so html for the bare bones css for the styling and javascript for the client-side logic what is client-side logic client side logic is simply what happens when a user interacts with the page so you can define what happens when somebody clicks on a button you can define what happens when somebody takes their mouse uh over to this particular heading and so on we'll learn about all these things let's now learn about these things using a very beautiful analogy so you can consider html as a car body assuming you own a car you must be having a metallic portion of the car which is nothing but the body exclude the engine exclude the seats exclude the color exclude all the designing which has been uh you know tailor-made for your car just remove all those things and your bare bones just the metallic body of your car can be you know looked upon as html if i add css to your car you can add paint decoration etc and your car is now designed so i can say that css has been added to your car what about javascript javascript is brain of your car it will logically define what happens when somebody sits inside the car what happens when somebody interacts with the car and this will comprise of car engine the logic of the interior the logic of the mid and all those things so this is a very good analogy that i think is very very beneficial when it comes to understanding what is the role of html css and javascript so html is the body of the car css is the paint decoration and other styles that is added to the car and javascript is the engine and the interior logic of the car so we start learning how to build beautiful layouts in this course we look into all the aspects of this particular thing which is html and we'll also look into how we can write html so that our web pages are seo friendly but before that we are going to install an ide comes source code editor which is visual studio code so we can use any text editor of our choice there is no compulsion you don't have to use visual studio code but i'm going to use visual studio code because it is lightweight it is open source and it is from microsoft and it is cool believe me so we'll go to google we'll type visual studio code so i'll say install vs code and [Music] head over to this website click on windows linux or whatever operating system you are in uh i'll click on windows because i'm on windows and an installer will get downloaded to my machine so vs code user setup.exe this particular installer is downloaded to my machine i'll wait for it to download and then i'll click on it and wait for it to install i will simply read the license agreement and then i'll simply click on i accept the agreement next next wait i want to check all these boxes make sure that you have all these boxes checked and then simply click on next then once again install and give it give it the time it needs and it is going to install visual studio code on your computer i'll wait for some time and visual studio code will be installed very soon on my machine as you can see visual studio code has been installed i don't want to launch it just yet i'll simply click finish if you have installed visual studio code just like i did you'll be able to open visual studio code inside a given folder now what i mean by that is you can simply go to a folder and you can simply right click and you can click on this open with code at the moment you do that this particular folder will be opened inside your visual studio code so you can see that my visual studio code shows these three files and this particular folder also shows these three files which means that the files which i see here and files which i see here are exactly the same and this folder has been opened inside my visual studio code we'll now move on to chapter number one and we'll see some important concepts of html in great detail so let's move on to chapter number one now so this is a pdf of chapter number one which i've created for you let me open this pdf in chrome uh so this is a chapter and we are going to create a first website in this chapter yes you heard that right so let us understand how we can create a basic website using html so we start building a website by creating a file named index.html now index.html is a special file name which is presented when the website root address is typed what does that mean let me explain it to you so what i'll do is i'll come to this chapter and inside this folder i'll simply right click and click on open with code what that will do is that will open this particular folder inside visual studio code for me so the folder which is being shown here these two files from this particular folder and these two files inside of my visual studio code are representing the same files from this folder which means that i am capable of opening this folder inside visual studio code let me show you something i'll create a new file by clicking on this icon and i'll say index.html i can also create a folder by clicking on this particular icon this is for creating a new folder this is for creating a new file at this moment what i've done is i've created a new file which is index.html if i show you this folder you'll see that index.html is also reflected here so index.html here and index.html inside visual studio code are representing the same thing i'll show you something simply press shift on your keyboard and press one so uh if you press that what will happen is you will see an exclamation mark and you will see this particular drop down this is nothing but emit abbreviation emit abbreviation means that it is going to print the boilerplate code for you so let me choose this first option and it will magically give me the boilerplate code that i need for this particular website now what does this mean what does this boilerplate code mean so there is some piece of code which all of my web pages are going to need this is the code that i'll require when i'm creating a basic html website now this has a title this has a body this has some meta tags now if you are new to html you might think that what what are these types of tags and why do i need all these tags do i need to remember this the answer is no you don't have to remember this all you need to remember is that in order to get this in visual studio code all you need is an exclamation mark and you have to press and enter key and that's going to do all the magic for you now if i press tab and if i change the title to programming with harry and if i press ctrl s what will happen is this will change the page title to programming with harry now i'll simply type i am page body here and after doing that what i'll do is i'll go to my extensions so you can click here to go to your extensions and install an extension called live server so live server is an extension which simply allows you to open a web page live in your browser what does that mean let me explain it to you so what i'm going to do is i'm going to install this in your case you will see this install button here simply click on that install button and live server will get installed and the moment you do that maybe you might have to restart your visual studio code in some cases but in most of the cases you're going to see an option of open with live server so the moment you right click on this page inside your index.html you will see an option open with live server click on this option and the moment you do that you will see this page open inside your google chrome or whichever is your default browser okay in my case it is google chrome now you can see that the title of the page is programming with harry and the body is here i am page body what if i change this i am page body to i am page body and description what if i do something like this this will automatically get updated here which is done by live server here i i don't have to refresh it all the time which is why i have installed live server chrome extension let's now try to understand what all these tags are about what is the stock type html what is this html tag what is this head tag what is this meta why do we have three meta tags let's try to understand all these things so inside your basic html page the very first line that we have is the doctype html this line specifies that this is an html5 document now back in the day we used to have html documents html5 is a new specification and this particular line at the top of your html page simply declares this page as an html5 document html tag is the root of an html page and whenever we have an opening tag we have a closing tag as well so i'll show you something i'll simply click here and i'll say full screen snap and i'm going to make a point by doing this so do you see this html tag the closing tag corresponding to this particular tag is this so html is opened here and html is closed there did you notice that the html tag is opened by writing html inside the angular brackets and it is closed by writing the same html inside the angular bracket except the fact that it starts with a forward slash so this is the closing tag this is the opening tag and inside the opening tag and closing tag is my html document same goes for head as well the head is opened here and head is closed here so this is the closing tag for head same goes for title as well the opening tag for title is there the closing tag for title is here same goes for body as well the opening tag of body is here closing tag of body is here so corresponding to almost all the text in html we have an opening tag and closing tag but there are some of the tags which do not require opening and closing tag and we are going to learn about those tags in the future but for now just keep this in your mind that whenever you have a tag you have an opening tag you have a closing tag and between these opening and closing tags lies some of more html of your page okay so in this case inside my body i have this h1 opening tag and h1 closing tag p opening tag p closing tag and inside this p opening tag and p closing tag is my paragraph so corresponding to almost all the tags there is an opening tag and a closing tag and between opening and closing tag lies some html okay so i'll close this snip and i'll come back to nodes so html is the root of an html document whatever you see inside your browser it includes the title it includes the body it includes the header footer whatever you see will be enclosed inside your html so html marks the start of your document i'm talking about this html tag this particular tag marks the start of your html document marks the start of your web page now let's talk about head head is something that is uh that includes the title it includes some meta information what is meta information meta tags means information about information for example this page might have a meta tag called description associated with it and this description will be used by search engine to you know display the content of the page when you search so i'll show you something let us say if i search javascript you'll see this particular text did you see this particular text search engines might use this particular text out of your meta description tag so if you write your meta description tags properly search engines are going to be happy with your websites okay so this is about the meta tag i have this meta tag here but i don't have metadata inside of here meta tags are not essential your page will still work if you don't have meta tags let's talk about the title title is the page title it's really very important because this marks the title of your page what your page is about is really very important for the users and you should write your title text very nicely okay now this particular closing head tag marks the closure of my head tag and from here starts the body of my pages now body of the page is something which which is displayed below this line did you see this line this particular thing this thing is the body of the page so whatever i see here will be the body of my web page okay now body might have a heading it might have a paragraph there are a lot of tags that i'm going to discuss in this course and you can use all those tags to write paragraph to write lists to write different types of headings and so on we are going to talk in depth about all these things okay and this marks the closing of body tag and this marks the closing of html tag so i hope you got an idea of how these things are working how html works how opening and closing tag works and how title body and all these things work inside a web page so a tag is like a container for either content or other html tags for example if you see this html document this html document will be received by the browser and this browser will render it inside of your computer screen so whatever you see inside your google chrome is something that is done by the browser the browser in reality accepts the html code so if you see this page this is not what this browser received this browser received this thing and your browser is smart enough to convert this code into this beautiful looking page so this is how html is passed by the browser so html document is received by the browser and that particular html code is rendered like this by your browser okay so this is how html document works there are a few important notes that i want to talk about here head and body tags are children of html tag so html contains the entire webpage which is why head and body are children of html html is the parent of head and body tags now since head and body are children of html html is the parent of head and body that that totally makes sense right now most of the html elements have opening and closing tags with content between opening and closing tags this is also very evident we have seen this now some html tags have no content and these are called empty elements now there is an example of empty element which is br which is used to create a new line after a heading or paragraph we can either use dot html or dot html extension with our web pages so it's not mandatory that you have to use dot html as the extension of your web page you might even use dot htm as your page extension if you are using html now you can use inspect element of view page source option from chrome to look into a website's html code this is also important all you need to do is you need to right click click on inspect and you will see all the code which has resulted into this page the code that browser has actually passed in order to display this page to you will be seen here okay i hope that makes sense as well now html element is nothing but starting tag plus content and ending tag so html when i say html element what i mean is i'm talking about the starting tag i'm talking about the content inside the starting diagram indeed and i'm talking about the ending tag so if i'm talking about head element i'm talking about this entire thing in this case if i'm talking about head i'm head element i'm talking about this okay so this is something that you need to take care um when you're talking about the html elements okay comments in html what is what is a comment so sometimes you might want to write something inside your source code which you don't want your browser to pass but the sad truth is that whatever you write here is going to be passed by the browser so if i say hey browser please don't parse this okay if i do something like this browser is not going to listen because it's not a human being it's going to show me this so in order to make this browser not pass this and completely ignore this i can actually write something called comment i simply pressed control plus forward slash inside my keyboard and i can toggle a comment so if i press control plus forward slash this particular thing will surround whatever i am selecting and this will be marked as a comment in html okay so in order to mark something as a comment in html all you need to do is angle bracket exclamation mark double dash and you have to close it like this double dash and closing angular bracket that's about it and you have a comment in html now if i show you the browser and if i reload this uh i think i forgot to save i'll save this so make sure that you save your file as well so the moment you save you'll see that this is not being passed by the browser anymore but if i show you the source code it will be there in the source code so if i zoom in you'll see that hey browser please don't parse this is inside my source code so make sure that you are not writing any confidential information inside the comments because your users will still be able to press right click and go to view page source and they are going to definitely see whatever comment you have inside your web page okay so i hope that makes sense let's now talk about case sensitivity is html a case sensitive language no it is not it is a case in sensitive language what is the case in sensitive language a case in sensitive language is a language where the upper case lower case or any other case doesn't matter when you're using the tags what does that mean so i can either say body or i can do something like this capital b or d y this will still work so if i do something like this this will still work i'll show you so if i reload this page this page will still work and if i go to the page source the capital body works capital head will also work capital title will also work and so on so i hope that you understood why html is a case sensitive language it works whatever be the case of your tags it can be uppercase it can be lowercase and so on so enough of theory about html let's now move into the chapter one practice set and solve some problems let's move on to chapter one practice set now so i'm back with chapter one practice set and here is a first question which we are going to solve and it says inspect your favorite website and change something on the page which is displayed so all we need to do here is to go to a website it can be anything i'm going to go to code withari.com and i'm going to open it now what i'm going to do is i'm going to right click here and i'll go to view page source so as you can see that i have compressed the html uh on my website i'm using angular universal to pre-render it you must be an html beginner and must be wondering what i'm saying but this is a very regular html page you can see what the content of the page is so here is the content of the page all the content of the page is visible here and this is a first website that we uh kind of inspected okay you can go to another website we can go to google fonts and we can inspect it so all i want from you is to go to the website have a look at the source code and try to understand why things are structured the way they are so this is our first exercise from chapter one practice it now the question number two says that go to your favorite website and try to view the page source and write the exact lines of code does it clone the website will copying the source code of fonts.google.com create a replica fonts.google.com is the question let's try to answer the question so what i'll do is i'll press ctrl a on my keyboard and i'll press ctrl c ctrl a for select all ctrl c for copy and now let's open vs code here so this is the index dot html now what i'll do is i'll say 0 1 underscore pr01.html and let me paste the source code i'll tell you something if you right click here you can see that there are only four lines and these lines are way too long okay which is why you are seeing it like this i'll show you how you can view the source code because this is not how you can conveniently view the source code there are two options the first option is go to the command palette in vs code and type word wrap world wrap i want to toggle word wrap so if you go to view toggle word wrap and if you select this option what vs code will do for you is it will display the entire line within this width it is not changing the way code is written i have not altered the file my file is the same the way i'm viewing it has changed previously i was allowing my lines to overflow from this vs code view container but now what i'm saying is i'm telling vs code hey please show me all these lines such that i can see them okay this is how i'm viewing my source code there is another way i can use there is another way i can use i can turn off the word wrap so i can go to command palette i can select this option to turn off the word wrap basically the code is the same except the fact that now the way i'm doing the code has changed i'm not viewing a line within this viewport the line is overflowing okay i hope you understood this now what i'll do is i'll right click and select this option format document this will actually change the way the code is structured so if i click on format document you can see previously there were only four lines there are now 351 lines but what vs code has done for me is it has changed the way the code was structured so it has basically formatted the code for me which is what i wanted okay so this is how vs code works the code has been formatted for me and now what i'll do is i'll right click i'll click on open with live server and you can see that unfortunately this page doesn't exist google fonts did it late the replica of the website no it did not why was that the case because this website is actually communicating with a lot of other css a lot of other apis maybe i'm not not allowed to access the api from this particular server that is a topic for another day but if you simply copy the html of a page and you try to paste it inside a file or rather a dot html file you are not going to see the replica of the website it's not that easy you can definitely clone a website to some extent it's possible but you cannot do something like this and have another clone of google fonts this is not possible this is what the question was about so did it clone the website no why because i might not have the access of some of the relative paths i might not have the access of some of the apis i might not be allowed to say access some other stuff from localhost a lot of things might be the reason but the answer is no and this is why you cannot clone a website like this write any html code inside a text file does it work if you write it using notepad so so far we have used visual studio code let me do something for you i'll open this folder i'll go to new text document i'll say notepad dot html i want to change the extension and it will give me a warning that hey you are changing the txt extension to dot html do you want to proceed was it something that you intended it will ask me all these things so it's basically telling me that this file might become unstable because you are changing the format so i'll say yes i know what i'm doing so let me do it now i'll open this particular file with notepad so you can always open dot html file using notepad so let me search for notepad i can't see notepad it's here okay so i have opened this file in notepad now what i'll do is i'll simply write html i'll write head and back in the day when there was uh or other i should say be your studio code and other source code editors like this were not as popular as they are today people used to write code like this okay or or i can safely say that back in the days of early computers uh early computing days 90s 80s people used to write code like this they were mainframe screens there were no operating systems like linux windows or mac but um it's it's an amazing time to live uh title and i'll say this is page title and i'll simply say title and html head title then i close the head tag i'll start the body tag i know you must be thinking what is this guy doing why is he typing everything i just want to show you that even if you type using notepad it's going to work so i'll say it works and i'll save it i just pressed ctrl s notepad.html has been saved i'll open this file in chrome and you can see that it works if i go to view page source i'll see all the source code does it work with live server as well yes it doesn't matter how the file was written if it is written and structured in a way that browser can understand it will definitely work so this is how um you know this works so doing this and doing this is a bit different here we are using a server here we are simply opening the file uh using our browser so you can see that file if you see here file is written and if you see here it's kind of a website for the browser so it's simply a file designing in our computer but if you use the server you will you'll get a lot of advantages that you'll know about in the future we'll always use live server when we are writing html css in javascript so yeah that was about chapter one practice set i hope you understood what the take away of chapter one practice set was uh we'll move on to chapter two now and we will start coding some beautiful websites and we'll try to get more understanding of html let's move on to chapter two now so here is a pdf of chapter two and let us now talk about some of the basic html tags we can add elements inside the body tag to define the page layout is something that we all know by now but which stack to use when is one of the most important questions and we are going to answer that in this chapter so let's do one thing let's go to this folder and open this folder in visual studio code i have opened this folder in vs code and i'm going to create a file called zero one underscore pr01 uh not pr0101 underscore uh structure.html so this particular file is going to describe the structure of html i'm going to use exclamation mark and enter to create the basic boilerplate of html this is automatically done by vs code when you put an exclamation mark this is called amit abbreviation once you say exclamation mark and you press enter key or you select this you are going to see this document now in order to define my page layout i can go inside the body tag and i can write whatever i want and it will be passed as html by my browser what does that mean let's try to understand so we can add elements inside the body tag to define the page layout what is an html element an html element is everything from starting to the ending tag so let us talk about body when i say html body element i'm talking about the opening body tag i'm talking about the closing body tag and the content inside the body tag it might be some other html tags it might be the plain text it might be some image tag it can be some sort of valid html just written inside bodytalk okay so now let's try to understand what our attributes so we know what an html element is let's now talk about attributes so html attributes are used to add more information corresponding to an html let's talk about anchor tag which is used to create links inside of a web page if i say a href is equal to this particular website and harry and then a hrf attribute is basically telling me that once this element is clicked please take the user to this website let's try this out let's try an a tag so what i'll do is i'll say code with harry.com and i'm going to open this with live server if you haven't installed live server yet you can install it from here by clicking here and searching live server here but for now i'm going to say go to the site and if i click on go to the site i'll be taken to the site so this is how this works okay so attributes are simply used to add more information to an html tag okay we can either use single or double quotes in attributes okay you can use a single quote or you can use a double quote but if you're using a single quote use single quote here and here as well if you're using a double quote use double quote here as well as here okay so we need to maintain consistency when it comes to quotes now let's talk about the heading tag the heading tag is used to mark headings in html we have already talked about um a href we already talked about if you write something inside the body it will be passed these are some of the important tags when it comes to html so whenever i start a page ideally i'll start with a heading i'll say uh food to eat for weight loss okay i'll do something like this and if i show this to you i'll go back to my website and if i reload this food to eat for weight loss is displayed like this so by default my browser knows that this is a heading and my browser knows how to pass it so it is passing it in such a way that it looks like a heading so this is the most important or the top most heading okay if i change this to h2 let us say i'll say h2 food one and let me say oats okay uh so you can see that the heading size has reduced when i typed h2 instead of h1 so if you use h1 you'll see heading like this and if you use h2 you'll see a smaller heading a relatively smaller heading will be displayed when we talk about h3 all the way till h6 so let me show that to you as well so i'll very very quickly uh change this to h3 and i'll install an extension called auto rename tag and i'll tell you what it does so auto rename tag will basically rename an opening as well as the closing tag automatically in vs code i am installing this application to make my task a bit easy so if i change this i think it has been installed yes it has been installed if i change this to h4 this as well as the closing tag has changed if i change this to h5 the closing tag has also been changed because inside the html and html will be valid only if i change the closing tag as well as the opening tag the opening tag and closing tags must match okay let's come back and see how h1 h2 h3h4 h5 and h6 looks h6 is the smallest of all headings and h5 is uh second second smallest and h1 is the largest okay so this is how all this works the note says that we should not use html headings to make text thick or bold yes this is important always use the tags for what they are created for if an html tag is created for heading use it only when you are giving headings to your page if an html tag is uh for paragraph do not use it for headings and so on you can always use you can always use heading tag to make a text bold but the problem is going to come in seo the problem is going to come when uh the third party sites are passing or google bots or some other bots are passing your website you do not want those problems coming your way okay so this was about the heading tag let's now talk about the paragraph tag the paragraph tag is used to add paragraphs to an html page let us say you are saying that food to eat for weight loss and you are saying food one i'll comment all this out because i want to add a paragraph below h2 so i'll say p i'll say oats is nice for weight loss because it is satiating okay and what i'll do is i'll show you how this looks oats is nice for weight loss because it's shading let me go to uh wikipedia of words and let me copy some of the uh lines from there okay so let me copy all this and what i'll do is i'll paste it here and you'll see that it has been formatted like a paragraph in my html page not here i'm talking about here it'll be formatted like a paragraph so this is how paragraph tag works it is to display a paragraph and it is doing the job here okay note that we have not used css because of which this page is not looking very beautiful and we can always use css and custom fonts and images and backgrounds and a lot of javascript we can always do all those things to make a website dynamic but this is the bare minimum the bare bones the bare bones structure of the website okay now coming back to the notes you can see that the another tag i want to talk about is the anchor tag we have already seen this tag this stack was used by us to go to a given website you can say go to site and it will go to the side which is written inside the href attribute so i've written this inside the hdf attribute i can also specify the target i can say target is equal to underscore blank and what this will do is this will open this in a new tab so this site will now be opened in a new tab because the target is underscore blank okay so let me show this to you if i reload this page and if i click on go to the site it is actually opened in a new tab so this particular thing is used to open a website in a new tab okay coming back to the notes the image tag is used to add images to an html page if you use an img tag what you can do is you can specify an image i have an image here if i use src is equal to what is the name of the image image.jfif i'll use this i accidentally typed here i want to type here image dot jfif this is something that i want to use inside my image tab and i can specify an alternative text in case this image is not available so as the image is not available or i can say adidas shoes let us say this is an image of adidas shoes okay adidas shoes why do we write alt attribute this alt attribute is very useful because it gives an alternative text to your image so in case your image is not available this text will be displayed let me show this to you so this is the image it was available which is why it is being shown i can always specify width and height of the image using width and height attributes so let me use width is equal to 67 pixels and the size of this image will shrink if i specify the height as well the aspect ratio might get hampered i don't want to hamper this aspect ratio but in case the image is not available in my case image 3 is not available here and any does fuse will be displayed you can see that the adidas used text has been displayed here because this image is not available okay i'll change it back to image.jfif and you can see that this image is available and we can see that this image is displayed because it is available okay now coming back to the notes let's talk about the next tag which is bold italic and underline so we can use bold italic and underline tags to highlight the text as follows so you can use the b dac you can use the i dag and you can use the u tag let's see how these tags work so if i say b if i say b i am bold if i say you i'll say i am oops i want to talk about italic if i say i i am italic and if i talk about you i am underlying okay so b i and you dark bold italic underline so bold italic underline you can always change the way they look using css a lot of people use these tags and then they change the formatting of these tags and they do not look the way they look when there is no css inside the page this is this is very normal for the websites many people change the size of which one they change the size of paragraph it depends upon the requirement they can change whatever they want using css styling and this is what the css is for you can change the size of the image you can change the way page looks you can change the background of the image you can you know use css to create layouts all these things can be done using css and it's perfectly normal coming back to the next tag and it is the br tag what is the br tag for it is used to create line breaks in an html document now br tag is an example of unpaid tag there are two types of tags in html paired tag and unpaired tags okay paired tags are basically the ones which has an opening tag and a closing tag so this is a paid tag br is an example of unpaid tag because i can use br without without a closing tag so i can say br and i do not need a closing or opening deck for br br is simply for a line break so if you are seeing br here um or let me show this here so i'm talking about winter oats and i want to line break right after winter roots so if i do something like this i want to uh to copy this i want to paste it here so i'm saying winter roots may and i need a line break and then i want to continue so if i show you the layout of the page so you can see that winter oats may and there's a line break be grown as an off season ground cover so there is a line break here because we are using a br tag here okay so this is how a br tag works okay this is an example of an unpaired tag we do not need an opening and closing tags uh we do not need a pair of tags to get it working okay let's talk about begin small dags big makes the text a bit larger and small makes the text a bit smaller very straightforward let me show it to you so big tag this is big now if i show you how this looks this looks like this the same goes for small tech as well i'll change it to small and this is small this is small and small text looks something like this this is small i do not recommend using these tags because you should always use css to structure your pages and um this is this is something that html offers but you can use css to better structure your web pages to better design your web pages let's talk about the hr deck once again another example of an unpaired tag which is used to create a horizontal low ruler often used to separate the content okay so let us say i want to separate this particular content and the image i can create a horizontal ruler i can say hr and you can see that a ruler a horizontal line has been created by the browser the browser parses this hr tag and converts this hr dac to this particular line let's talk about the subscript and superscript tags the subscript and superscript tags in html are used to create subscript and superscript let me show you an example so let us say you want to write the chemical formula of ozone you'll say sub and you will say 3 and you'll do something like this you'll say oh so o3 is the chemical formula of ozone let's say you want to write three square or x square you'll do something like this and you'll use a super tag and you'll you'll say two so x square and o three you can write these things like this so this is ozone and this is x square i hope you understood how sub and soup works so sub is for subscript and soup is for superscript let's talk about the pre tag html always ignores the extra spaces and new lines so let us say i have this text uh i'll write a paragraph here i'll say i am a good a lot of spaces boy if i save this and if i go to my page you'll see that only one space has been passed and only one space is displayed by the browser but in my source code i had a lot of spaces what if i want to see all these spaces i can always wrap my content inside a pre tag and if i do that what will happen is i'll see all these spaces so if you want to render your content as is you can use a pre tag this is how pretag works this is used to render content which demands to get displayed as is so in this case you can see this is written using pre tag has a new line so if you have a new line here if you write a paragraph and you say i have and you say a new line and if i save this the new line will not be preserved i have a new line is displayed like this in order for it to display what i'll have to do is i'll have to wrap it inside a pretag so when i wrap it inside a pre tag what happens is it displays the text as is as you can see here so all the new lines and all the spaces are preserved i hope you understood how these stacks work i urge you to practice all these tags and start writing html yourself because if you practice you are going to understand html in a very fun way and it will be very easy for you to master it let's now move on to chapter two practice set and practice some of these tags in the last video we talked about the structure of html documents and we also talked about some of the most important tags that you all should know we'll now be solving chapter number two practice it let me open this for you and we have few questions which we have to solve using html and this is really very simple let me tell you create an html page with a heading a primary heading and a subheading so you have to use the h1h2h3 headings in order to create this structure and you have to tell which text you use so i want you to try this on your own before looking into the solution because solutions are going to vary i am going to solve it in a different way maybe you are going to solve it in some other way let me solve this for you so there should be a heading the title heading and then there should be a primary heading and then a sub heading so what i'm going to do is i'm going to write pr01.html so this is our program number one so let me say 0 1 underscore pr01.html i'm going to use the boilerplate code and what i'm going to type here is uh i'm going to type h1 and i'll say let me talk about programming languages to learn okay and then i'll say h2 i'll say web development for different fields okay so here i'm going to talk about web development i'll write something about web development now i'll tell you something in order to generate dummy text in order to generate say 200 words or 300 words you can do something like this you can say lorem and number of words so let us say i want to generate 34 words i'll say lorem 34 and i'll press enter and this is going to generate 34 random words for me it's not random words basically this is uh i'm not sure which language i think german if i'm not wrong uh lorem ipsum is which language loram if some language which language is it it's latin okay it's it's a latin phrase so this is something which is generated automatically let me do one thing let me turn on word wrap so that you can see the words included here so this is used to generate dummy text let me show how this website looks this is how the website looks primary heading secondary heading then subheading okay let me create a subheading i'll say i'll say something about web development then i'll simply say uh end then i'll say something about back end and i'll say lorem 23 and then i'll say front end i should have said front end first back end after front end order doesn't matter but again front end and i'll say something about oops lorem 23 so uh i'll say something about backhand and this is how my page is going to look i'm not sure if we can generate this in english uh lorem i'll say lorem if some in english can we generate something like this in english so you can find few websites online which can allow you to generate random text in english so you can copy the text from wikipedia it doesn't matter let's move on to the next question question number one is all sorted let's move to next question which says create a page with five wallpaper images taken from the internet so i'll simply say free wallpapers wallpapers okay i want to download free wallpapers let me use unsplash unsplash is an amazing website um i have used it in the past it has amazing images and it's it's amazing for web developers let me tell you i'm going to download it for free this is going to be my first image let me see if i'm going to get some images related to coding let me search coding here and we got few images these are sponsored images these are the free images let me look into this image uh okay this looks pretty good let me download this i'm going to download four images and i'm going to copy these four images into my folder okay so these are the four images that i downloaded let me rename them to one and then this one to two then this one to three then this one to four and so on one two three four now what i'll do is i will simply create another file i'll say zero to underscore and let me call it images.html i'll put the boilerplate code and i'll use four image tags and i'll say one dot jpg here two dot jpg here three dot jpg here and four dot jpg here it doesn't look good let me tell you uh when it is rendered but we are going to change it using css you can watch my css video i'm going to upload a css video in english very soon so there you will start enjoying the things now this image is very large so we'll have to set the width and height let me set the width i'll say width is equal to 344 pixels and 34 pixels should be fine it should be good enough for this image to fit fit into this page yes it looks good so this is a page with images taken from the internet so these images are taken from the internet and we have finished the task successfully let me tell you that you can change this title as well so if i go to this title i can say internet wallpapers i can do something like this and i should see internet wallpapers here so this is how you can change the title in html let's move on to the next question use br and hr text to display a piece of text with line break this is super simple this is the simplest problem from this practice set uh h our hr underscore br html and i'm going to put the boilerplate code and i'm going to put random text okay let me spell random correctly i'll say lm34 and what i'll do is i'll say hr and then i'll again say lorem34 and after i double l o i'll put a br i'll put a br and let me save it and let me open this particular thing in live server let's see how this works so i think okay so we already have the server running let me look into this file and open this so this is how it looks this is the hr and after i double lo we have a line break so hr works br works now let's move on to the next question super simple once again it's a chemical equation you have to model it inside a web page this is very simple and html in fact is very simple let me tell you so by the end of this video by the way you'll know everything you need to know about html html is pretty straightforward let me write chemical equation chemical underscore equation.html and boilerplate code and i'll say c plus o2 i'll do something like this and i'll say co2 c02 not 0 to c o2 okay now if i render it like this let me dispose this port and open this page this is going to look something like this but i want to as subscript because this is oxygen o2 is for oxygen co2 is for carbon dioxide let me use my sub tag sub for super subscript so subscript and i'll say 2 instead of this two and i'll replace this two as well with sub two and super simple easy peasy lemon squeezy this is pretty straightforward i hope that you were able to understand this i don't think that there is any issue with uh using sub and sup tags super simple question number five is something that you will attempt yourself try to write a wikipedia article using html and all you have to do is simply go to wikipedia let me go to coding wikipedia and let's open this wikipedia page all you have to do is try to get this image try to get this heading this is an image try to get this heading wikipedia by the way contains very minimal html uh sorry very minimal styling it has a very raw html kind of structure so it is going to be very easy for you to model it but try to model it i know it will be a little bit difficult for you to model it at this point of time but again try to model it try to at least get the text correct using br and hr tags this particular thing is hr this line is hr this line is hr once again this is hr so i hope that you'll be able to model this wikipedia page to some extent this completes our chapter to practice it we are now going to move into chapter number three we will explore more of html stuff let's move on to chapter three now so let's now move on to chapter number three and dive deeper into html so i'm opening this pdf up and you can see that we are going to create a page layout this time and we are going to learn how to lay a website out so this is a very important skill when it comes to designing websites you learn html css javascript you will start designing the websites everything will go well but a good web developer is always going to create an amazing page layout and that's what this chapter is about so when we use the right tag in right place it results in a better page layout better indexing by search engines and better user experience as well so we want everybody to be happy we want search engines to be happy we want users to be happy and we ourselves want to be happy so this is how we can create an amazing page layout there are some of the tags that we are going to use and let's look into these tags so we use the following tag to get the job done we use a header tag we use a main tag and we use the footer tag header contains the nav tag and it defines the header of a website and then footer contains the footer of the website if there is any footer on the website and then comes the main tag um inside which we insert uh the main opening tag then we have a section tag then we have an article tag and then we have an assigned tag and this is used to lay a content which is not very important to the page it doesn't describe the page but again it is in the page which is why it is named aside and it contains the content aside from the main content okay for example the ads the sidebar the navigation bar or something these kind of things uh can be kept inside the site tag article is a self-contained content it contains the main content of the page section is the one section of a page for example if you have an e-commerce store then you might have men's clothing as on your first section and then women clothing as another section so section describes what is there inside one particular entity so it it basically defines content inside the page but again we are structuring the content in a better way now creating a page like this is not necessary you can always go with h2 h3 and paragraphs but again if you do it like this it will be readable by the people it will be readable by the search engines it will be readable by everybody okay and everybody will be happy and they are therefore useful for seo so we use all these things for seo we will always want to optimize our websites for search engines now let's talk about the link or attributes we've already seen the a tag we have already seen what hrf is going to do inside the a tag it is going to take the user to another page on the same website or on some other page on the internet okay so we can always use a tags and this will open the contact page in the same tab this will open contact in a new tab let me go into my folder and open this folder in vs code i'm going to create a file here index.html i'll use the boilerplate code and i'll zoom in so that you all can see what is happening here so we have this document we have this body i'll name this to page layout and also what i'm going to do is i am going to open this in live server and this is going to open my page layout page inside the live server let us do one thing let us start demoing all these things one by one so we will use the header main and footer so let me create a header i'll say header then i'll say footer and between header and footer will come the main tag and inside the main tag will come the main content and inside the main content will come some sections so i'll say section section is a tag i can have multiple sections inside my first section i'm going to use h1 i'll say uh or rather let me do one thing i'll say clothing and then inside my first section i'm going to use h2 i'll say men's clothing and then i'll save women's clothing okay so let me let me do the same thing for another section as well so let me use this and women's clothing okay women's clothing and let me say lorem 23 and and i want to always turn my word wrap on a word wrap you can always search the settings in vs code many people ask me how do i remember all these things but i do not remember all these things for the sake of remembering i always search the internet i always ask my friends and once i get to know something it's it's behind the back of my mind so this setting is behind the back of my mind that enabling the word wrap will actually let me get rid of this horizontal bar i don't need this horizontal bar i want my text to appear like this why because i want to see entire text which is coming on this page okay so men's clothing women's clothing once again i'm going to do lorem 23 inside a paragraph so i'll say lorem 23 and i will save and once again if i open this page i'm going to see this now this is not changing anything using main aside section and all these semantic tags by the way these are called semantic tags in html and semantic tags will simply make your html look nicer to the bots it will make it look structured to other developers to everybody okay which is why we use these things using these things once again is not necessary you can always use the the old traditional html without all these stacks but again using these stacks are going to make it clean it is going to make it search engine optimized let me do one thing i'll say clothing on the internet okay what i'll do is i'll show you what i'm planning to do here i'll simply say clothing and i'll open a random link uh so clothing clothing clothing myntra clothing i'll copy this link by the way and after copying this link i'm going to um i'm going to use the women clothing and men clothing so men clothing is here women clothing is here so i'll simply copy this one for women clothing and what i'll do is i'll say a extra physical this and then inside this will come h2 by the way in order to move the tags i'm using alt up arrow key and alt bottom arrow key this is going to take your tags wherever you want them to go inside vs code obviously if you're using some other source code editor there might be some other shortcuts now as you can see here women's clothing will take you to the myntra women clothing page let me show this to you once you click on women's clothing you'll go to this mantra.com shop slash women and the same goes for men's clothing and for men clothing let me copy this link and attack and then i'm going to do this okay and obviously it is not looking good because i have not used any styling i can always use css to style my web pages and it is going to look much much much cleaner and better but we are going to use html in this tutorial and i'm going to make a css tutorial as well for you guys so if you want a css tutorial let me know i am going to create um a css tutorial for you as well okay so this is men's clothing this is women's clothing and we have uh we have done it okay so let me close this and if i click on men clothing then you will go to this page but i wanted to open in a new tab and in order to do that what we do is we use target attribute we will say target is equal to underscore blank and this is going to open this particular link in a new tab so let's try this out we will go to a page i'll reload it i'll click on men's loading and these two links are going to take me to mantras page and these links will open in a new tab as you can see so this is how these links work and this is how all these semantic tags work we can put any content inside an anchor you can put images you can put headings i have used headings as you can see and these are headings inside an anchor tag and whenever you click on these headings you'll be taken to another page okay so this is how this works if the page is inside a directory we need to make sure that we link to the correct page this is important if the page is inside a directory you need to use the directory slash something so i'll show you something so let us say you have an html page inside a folder let me call it folder and it can be anything i'm calling it folder but this can be anything okay now let us say there is a page inside folder this dot html okay and all i want to do here is i'm going to say i am this okay i am this now let us say i want to use an anchor tag and i want my user to go to this so let me use an anchor tag here i'll say slash folder slash this okay and what i'll do is i'll say go to this now this particular link will take me to this webpage let me show you if i reload it i'll click on go to this it'll take me to this this page so if i have a page inside a folder i'll have to write the name of the folder then slash and then the page and if i have nested hierarchy then i'll have to use that hierarchy let's say we have a folder inside of a folder inside of a folder i'll have to say slash the name of this folder then slash the name of the folder which is inside this folder and so on until i get to the page so this works simply like windows or linux or mac os paths so this should be straightforward coming back to the notes you can see that this is what i mean when i when i save the pages inside a directory we need to make sure that we link to the correct page i hope that you got it now we can add links to images like this we can use an anchor tag and we can use an image inside an anchor tag and height will be set automatically because width is 120 we can give we can give it and height will be set automatically maintaining the aspect ratio so let me show this to you what i'll do is i'll simply use img src is equal to let us say img slash cwh slash gfif jfif so i have an image inside this img folder which is the image i'm using here i'll save this and i'll take you to this page and this displays this image but this image is very very large and you can see that i am getting this horizontal bar let me do one thing what i'll do is i'll simply say img width is equal to 100 pixels okay let us say i want 100 pixels i'll say width is equal to 100 pixels and you can see that the width is 100 pixels and the height is set automatically because uh because the image will maintain the aspect ratio now let's talk about the div tag and let's talk about the span tag as well and this will complete this chapter so div tag and span tag both of these decks are very very important why because div tag is often used as a container for other elements let us say i want to structure a page most of the websites that you are going to see on the internet will be using div and spans a lot so dev is simply a container and when you use a div tag it is often used as a container for other elements and there is a block level element which means it always takes full width let me show this to you so let us say i have a div i have a div and inside this div i have a paragraph i'll say i am a paragraph or rather let me do one thing uh what i'll do is i'll write i am up error like this okay now if i come to this page now if i right click on i am para and i click on inspect what i'll see is that the moment i hover over this i am a para this is taking the entire width of the page it is not taking only the part it should have taken it is taking the entire width of the page but if i do the same thing with span let me show it to you if i do the same thing with span by the way i'm using auto rename tag extension which is renaming my tags automatically when i'm renaming the opening tag it is renaming the closing tag as well okay so let me come back to the browser and you can see that if i hover over the span it is taking the width it should take i'm going to say that it is taking the width which is required by it so i am apparel requires this amount of width and it is taking this amount of width but in case of div it is taking the entire width of the page so this is really very important this is the difference between different span div is a block level element block level elements takes the entire width of the page and inline elements they do not take the entire width of the page they take as much width as necessary so this is very important examples of some other inline elements are image image also takes as much width as required it doesn't take the entire width of the page so i hope that you were able to understand all the concepts which were described in this chapter number three and you are going to build your page layout starting from now but before that we are going to look into chapter 3 practice set where i have some of the very important questions to understand all these concepts so let's move on to chapter number three and solve some amazing questions let us now move on to chapter number three practice set where we are going to solve some of the very important questions from chapter three so let me open the pdf and also i'm going to open this folder in visual studio code this is going to open this folder in code which is a source code editor and also we are going to solve all the questions that are inside this practice set so the first question says that create an seo friendly website using html and when i say seo friendly website using html i just mean you need to use semantic tags and you can always do that by following this particular chapter and what i've done is i have used header main and footer and also i've used sections inside of all these things so if you want to create an seo friendly website you can use semantic tags but this is not the only thing that is going to boost your website's seo there are a lot of other things there are meta tags there are a lot of other things as well which we are going to talk about in the later videos but for now this website is the solution of question number one so create an seo friendly website using html this website is an seo friendly website let's move on to the next question which says create an html page which opens google when clicked on an image and this is really very simple i have to use anchor tag so what i'll do is i'll say zero one underscore pr02 dot html and all i'm going to do here is i'm going to change the title to go to google so let me type go to google and let me add an image here so what i'll do is i'll say img then inside the img folder i'm going to use this image and then alt is equal to go to google and what i'll do is i'll simply say click the image below to go to google.com okay and i'm going to wrap the entire thing in href but before that i'm going to wrap it in h1 so what i'll do is i'll say ahref is equal to i'll say a href is equal to https google.com and i'm going to close the anchor tag right after this image so this is how my anchor tag looks let me open this thing in live server and you can say click the image below to go to google and the moment i click on this image i'll be taken to google.com so this works okay now the next question says that create a website which has your five top used websites bookmarked so we have to create a website which will have five top used websites bookmark the links should open in a new tab and this is also simple so i'll say zero to underscore pr03.html03.html and all you have to do is create bookmarks for yourself so i'll say a href is equal to say facebook.com and these days people use a lot of whatsapp so you can use whatsapp.com i'll see facebook and before replicating it i want to add the target is equal to underscore blank attribute and here i'll say google and here i will say linkedin okay linkedin and i'll change this to linkedin.com and this one to facebook.com okay sorry google.com my bad google.com okay so if i open this particular file in live server you can see that clicking on facebook is going to take me to facebook.com and this will open facebook.com in a new tab same goes for linkedin as well and same goes for google as well okay so this is how you can create a website for yourself which will contain your most visited pages you can also use div tags if you want all these links to appear below each other so let me use div so you can use multi-cursor functionality of vs code the moment you click on alt and you start clicking on somewhere inside your window you can type something and that something will appear everywhere you have a cursor so in this case i'm going to say dev and i'll press shift i'll use my arrow keys to select this div i'm going to press ctrl x this will cut the div i'll press n this will take me to the end of the line for each cursor and then i'll press ctrl v this might sound a little bit tricky but once you get the hang of how multi-cursor functionality in vs code works you're going to love it okay so let me save and let me show you how this looks now the links are appearing below each other i hope you liked this chapter 3 practice set and you understood each and everything that we learned about in this chapter let's now move on to chapter four and explore a bit of more html we'll now move on to chapter number four so let's open chapter number four pdf where i have written notes for you so this pdf is about lists tables and forms this chapter is going to teach you about how list works how tables work and how forms work so let's start with list lists are used to display content which represents a list for example list of all the items that you're going to buy from the grocery tomorrow list of all the um all the shoes that you want to buy list of all the uh all the storage devices you own there can be tons of example list of all the friends that you actually think are your friends okay this might sound weird but let's start exploring the types of lists the first type of list is an unordered list an unknown list is something which it doesn't has any order now this is used to list on ordered items for example let us say you are creating a navigation menu and you have a lot of items in your navigation menu you can use home about and contact there can be a lot of other tabs but ul can be used as a tag to define the beginning of an unordered list and you can then use li for the list items let me show you how this works so what i'm going to do is i'm going to open this in vs code and i'm going to close the chapter 3 vs code window i will create a new file i'll say 0 1 underscore list dot html and here i'm going to give it a heading of list okay inside of body what i'll do is i'll use a div and inside the div i'll say this i'll say this is an unordered list okay now after writing this is an unordered list what i'm going to do is i'm going to actually use an unordered list and i'll say home and there can be a lot of other list items i'll say about i'll say services services okay contact contact us now after doing this what we'll do is open this in live server and you can see this is an unordered list home about services contact us this has been displayed by the browser let me open just these two tabs and i'm going to close the other tabs now what about ordered list what is an ordered list let us say i want to use the same thing for ordered list instead of unordered list i'll comment this out and i will change this to ordered list so i'll say oh well you you might be noticing that when i'm changing the opening tag the closing tag is also getting changed but this might not be the case for you because i have installed an extension called auto rename tag if you don't have this extension your browser or rather vs code will not rename the closing tag while you are renaming the opening tags so keep a note of that also let us see how ordered list works so when you say ordered list the list will have an order by default it will use one two three four as the order now you can change these numbers to roman numbers you can also change these to a b c d and other types of formats uh using css but this video is not about css we'll explore this in a css video but for now just understand that this is an ordered list let me also change the heading because it says unordered list and i want to change it to ordered list so i'm going to do this and you can see that this is an ordered list and this is an unordered list i'll uncomment this one as well so that you can see the difference between the ordered and unloaded list this is pretty simple and straightforward let's move on to tables now the table tag is used to define tables in html very simple and straightforward you can use tables let me show you how html tables work uh why am i googling it why am i not showing you by writing the code because i want to show you the tables that you'll see after they have been designed using css this video is not about css which is why i am not showing you the um the raw rod tables for now i will definitely write code and show you the raw tables but i want you to see how table looks after they have been styled let's go to a website uh you don't have to worry about it but bootstrap i think i misspelled it bootstrap.com and i want to show you the tables from bootstrap you don't have to worry about all this this is simply a website and i want you to show the tables from this website content i want to look for tables so this is how the tables are going to look after they have been styled you can see that how beautiful this table looks but the raw html table will look like this only after they have been styled using css so i'll close this tab now and let us start creating a table for creating a table i'll create a new file and i'll say zero to underscore table.html and i'll put on the boilerplate code i'll say table and then i'll say h2 table now what i'll do is i'll use a table tag table is an html tag and we can use the stack to initialize a table this is the beginning of our table the table tag is used to define tables and it is used to format and display tabular data now there are three more tags which can be used inside of tables they are tr td and th tr tag is used to display table row td for table data th for displaying the table headers okay let me show you how this works so what i'll do is i'll simply say th this is stable heading i'll say name and then after after that what i'll do is i'll say about and then i'll say roll okay now after doing this what i'll do is i will use td which is for table data and i'll wrap this th inside of tr so let me show this to you and even if i show you the bootstrap page getbootstrap.com they have also used the same thing the tables are structured in the same way you can see that we have tr which contains all the table headings and then we have the table data inside of tr okay so what we'll do is this is a row this is a table row and inside the row are the headers okay now we'll create a row but instead of creating a row and headings will create row of data okay so this is a row which contains the headings which will be done only once and after that i'll simply say harry and about i'll say software engineer and the role we can say um ai lead okay now i'll save this and show you how this table looks so i'll open this in live server and you can see that this is how the table looks note that the table heading has been um bolded by default by the browser and these rows are not bolded they are not emphasized as much as the headings because it takes inside the heading is something which should be highlighted and it is highlighted let us now move on and add some more data so i'll simply say harry two i know i'm being lazy here but you can fill it with more data i'm saying harry two software engineer two way i lead to and this is going to work okay now there is something called table head and table body and let me show these stacks to you so tr is used to display table row then table data th for table heading okay i hope you got these three tags we have used these three tags we can define as many table rows as we want to add a cache into the table we can use caption inside the table tag let me show this to you so inside the table tag i'll say caption and i'll say this is an amazing table okay let me move on to my table and you can see this is it you can see that this is a table caption you can always style this table caption using css which is not a big deal now let's talk about t head and t body tag what is t head and what is t body t head is used to wrap table head a caption in tr with th so you can use caption and tr with t h so let's do it caption and t r with th can be can be moved inside the body which is what i've done here you can see that t body contains oops uh sorry this should be t head not t body because this is the heading and the same goes for t body as well the body and what we'll do is we'll cut this and we will add another t body here i'll remove this td and i'll format the document so that it looks good and also i'll remove the extra spaces i'll save this file and you can see that this is how it looks but we can always wrap the head of the table and body of the table with the head and tea body i hope that you all understood how these things are working why are we wrapping it using t hand and t body we are wrapping it because we might want to add some styles to only the table head or to only the table headings so you can always target this thing using css okay let us now move on to the next topic which is called span attribute and this is also important because when you're using a table sometimes you want a particular cell to span more than one column okay and we can use this uh call span is equal to the number of columns you want of one particular cell to span uh you can always define it using call spell let me show you how this works so um what we'll do is we will go to a th and we can again we can go to t td as well i'll say call span is equal to four and the moment i save and show you you can see that harry is taking four columns one two three and then fourth column okay so if you want a cell to span more than one columns you can always use call span let's now talk about some html forms a form is used to collect input from the user form tag is used for the same and let me tell you this thing in layman terms forms are used by the developers whenever they want some user data to be submitted to the server so let us say you want to collect some details from the user what you will do is you will use forms in order to collect that data and there will be an option to submit the data to the server now submitting data to the server is something which comes under the backend and not on the front end and html is something which comes in the front end so at this point we are understanding how front end works and specifically how html works front-end consists of html css and javascript and we are looking into the html part of it so there are different form options form elements for different kinds of user input there is an input element there is a text area element then there is a select element once again there are different types in input element let me show you the input element so this can be of type text checkbox radio button and submit we also have a file type so let me show how this works so what i'll do is i'll say 0 3 underscore form.html and i'll put in the boilerplate code and in place of document i'll say form form and inside the body i'll use the form tag so action is something which will tell the browser what should be done with this data now action can be get or it can be post you might want to post some content on the server or you might want to make something known as a get request now at this point i'm not talking about the post and get requests we will be talking about how input tag works so type of the input tag is very important let me show you some types of the input tag so this can be a password this can be a button this can be a submit type is equal to submit and then we also have input type is equal to file and let me open this in live server for you you can see that this is how input text looks like and this is how input type is equal to password looks like and this is how input type is equal to file looks like this is input type is equal to submit and you can see that it is submitting this data to this form uh now this is input type is equal to button you'll have to give it some value so i'll say value is equal to this and the moment i write this you'll see that this is coming under um under the button so the difference between this button and this button is that this button will submit the data and this button will not submit the data so whenever you want to use a button and you don't want that form to be submitted whenever that button is clicked you will use this type of button which is type is equal to button but if you want a button to submit data whenever clicked you will use input type is equal to supplement i hope that that is clear for all of you now coming back to the nodes there is a text area element then there is a select element let me show you the text area element and also let me show you the select element so if i said text area uh it will give me an option of number of those number of columns i can give it a name i can give it an id and also i can say this is the text inside the text area okay so i will show you how this changes the form so this is a text area and this is a text inside the text area these spaces are coming before this because we have these spaces here so if you don't want these spaces to come you can do something like this and these pieces will disappear so this is how input type is equal to text area looks like let us now see select option so select name and id is something which can be given then we can give an option so value is equal to let us say car this is car and then [Music] jeep this is jeep then when this is banned this is how it works let me show it to you so there are three options this is car this is jeep this is when when you're submitting this data to the server the values will get submitted so these values will get submitted and you will get a deeper understanding of this when you learn some backend language and you start submitting data to the server in order to do that you might want to look into languages like php frameworks like django flask you might also want to look at nodejs but again that is for the later part currently we are looking into html let's move on to the nodes back and let us read out something i've written in the notes you don't have to remember all the tags you will automatically memorize them with practice this is very important for the beginners out there because they tend to memorize each and everything that comes their way you don't have to do that all you have to do is keep practicing keep developing pages and you will get a hang of it now embedding videos video tag is used to play videos in html you can use a video tag and you can use the stack to play videos on your web page so let us see how this works so video src is equal to this and then i'll use a closing tag to close this video now since there is no header.html nothing is going to play let me place a video inside my current directory and you will see that video will start playing so i just managed to place a harry dot mp4 video which is nothing but a part of the recording of this video let us see how this works let me come back to my um to my page the forms.html and this video is taking a lot of space look at this look at this look at this the width and the height it is taking a lot of space also what i'll do is i'll add a control stop here and the moment i add this controls attribute uh what will happen is uh the controls will show up you can see that now also next checkbox and this video is playing okay so if you want the controls to come all you need to do is write controls here also i'll say width is equal to 23 pixels or rather 233 pixels because 23 is too small even this thing is very small but let me change the or rather reset the zoom of the browser and you can see that this action is something now this website is not looking good because we have not styled it using css we'll definitely style our website using css if we are going in production at the moment we are not going into production we are just looking into how html works and how to use tags like video how to use forms how to use tables etc now there are some important attributes for video i've written you can use width we just used it and height will automatically get adjusted now we can also use auto play or loop to auto play or loop the video so you can do something like this you can say auto play and you can also say loop and if you if you do something like this let me show you the input and let me show this this okay so what happens is whenever you add auto play on loop what will happen is this video will automatically play whenever the video or whenever the web page loads and also this video will start playing once again whenever it completes so whenever this video finishes playing it will start playing let me show you you can see that it started playing the moment it finished so this is how html video attribute works let's now move on to chapter number four practice set and let's explore some more things in html and let's practice some of the things that we just studied in chapter number four now that we have looked into so many concepts of chapter number four we are going to look into chapter four practice set so what i'm going to be doing is i will open this in vs code and we will solve this problem set so the question number one says create an html page with video embedded inside of it so we need to create an html page and we have to embed a video inside of it and this is as simple as doing uh this thing so i'll say zero four underscore pr01.html i'll put in the boilerplate code and i'll use a video tag i'll say video src is equal to harry dot mp4 and all i'll do after this is i'll write controls this is going to show me all the controls to control the videos um i i can seek i can play i can pause i can do all that stuff so let me open this live server if you don't have live server extension installed yet you should install it as soon as possible because if you don't do that you will you will not be able to do this uh so to follow along you will have to install live server type text checkbox radio button let me and submit we also have a file so this is how you can solve question number one let's move on to the next question and this is replace the video one video in one with a youtube video this at the very first glance looks really very tricky but i'll show you why this question is really super simple all you have to do is go to youtube go to any of the videos so i'll go to a youtube video and after that i'll click on share and there is an option to embed so i'll click on this embed option with this embed option youtube is basically telling you that use this url and you can embed this video any way you want so you can simply use this url and you should be able to um you should be able to get this video on your website let me copy this url let me paste it inside my vs code and the moment i do that um i will open this in live server and this is the video i got okay let me get rid of this one so that you can see that one and the height and width can be set by you as well i meant to say 1920 by 1080 and this is the uh video that we just embedded so i'll reset it and you can see that we are able to see this video so i can simply play this video and this video will start playing okay so uh you can you can create a webpage a very simple webpage which will have all your favorite songs or all your favorite videos at one place this is going to be super simple just using html how cool is that so i am going to move on to the next question now the next question from a pdf says that create an html page sorry html form for a travel website to book a vacation okay so let us create our fifth program and i'm going to say zero five underscore pr02.html i'll put in the boilerplate code and what i'll do is i'll simply use a div tag inside that i'll use the form tag and i'll press the tab key the moment you press the tab key your cursor will be taken inside the form so i'll simply use the input tag and i'll use import text and after typing input text i'll say enter your name okay so i'll simply say enter your name enter your name i'll simply save and after doing this i'll use enter your city and then i'll use enter your phone number and in order to take the phone number as an input i'll make it input type is equal to 10 uh when are you planning to travel planning to travel and i'll simply say input time and the moment i do that and i right click and open this in live server i'll close the other tab close other tabs you can see that the time can be selected from here and a date can also be selected if you choose input type is equal to date i'll show you that thing as well so when are you planning to which date are you planning to travel so let me change this to which date are you planning to travel okay the moment i save it you'll see that these things are organized in this manner you can always click here and you can select the date your browser has the capability to show you this drop down which can be used to select any date of your choice same goes for time as well you can select the time of your choice that is able to travel at 320 so i'll simply use 3 and i'll use 20 and you can use any time of your choice but this is not how we are going to use the forms in most of our websites that we'll develop and why is that the case i'll tell you we use something called a label attribute and you you'll know why i'm using label attribute in just a moment let me comment this out so that you can use this as a reference now i'm going to use a div tag and i'm going to give it a class of form control and why am i giving it a class of form control i'm doing that because i want to uh i want to be able to write some css targeting this class let me tell you the difference between the class and an id a class can be given to multiple elements but an id can be given to a single element for example i'll give you an example your role number in your school is your id it's unique it's for you and the class you study in is shared by all the students of that class so that class can be given to multiple students and they all can study so class is given to multiple elements and all the css corresponding to a given class is applied to all the elements and the id is unique to one single element an id uniquely identifies an element on the webpage okay i hope that you got it now what i'll do is i'll use a label tag and why do we use a label tag we simply use label tag to label which we use the label tag to label which form field this particular text corresponds to i hope you got the point why we use the label we just want to say that this entire name is for this input tag and when i do that what i'll do is i'll put the id that i'm putting here let us say i'm putting an id of name i'll put this id inside for so for attribute contains the id of the tag this label corresponds to so this enter your name corresponds to this thing so as you just saw label for is equal to name i use this format i'm going to copy this once again and i'm going to replace this text with this and the same goes for this let me cut it let me change the id to let me change the idea to city i'll change the ide to city and once again i'll do the same thing for phone number i'll simply use ctrl d or a set of control d's to get this task done so i just change all these text and all these for is equal to to the id of the corresponding input text and the moment i save it i'll show you how this looks and this is how the form should look we can always add the spacing at the paddings and change the font and beautify this form a bit more using css but um just a moment i think i forgot to delete this one uh i don't need this so this is how our form looks and we can always add padding we can add the css we can always add anything to beautify this html page we can also add a heading here so let me show you i can do something like this uh travel planner and you'll see a heading called travel planner here i know this is not the most beautiful form on this internet but uh this this looks pretty decent it can be used to fill in the details but again you will definitely use css to be able to beautify it to be able to use it in your production websites so this is how the form works why do we use the label tag i want to demonstrate this with another attribute and what i'll do is i'll say type is equal to radio and i'll say id is equal to let us say yes and for is equal to uh or rather i'll say id is equal to food for is equal to food do you do you want to do you need to use do you want to use a catering services do you want to use a catering services and if somebody wants to use the catering services they can always say yes i want to use it or they can say i don't want to use it so in this case what i'll do is i'll simply uh say do you want to use a catering services and then after that i'll say yes or no okay so i'll use the type to check box and i'll simply say id is equal to food and i'll show you something the moment i check this check box this is checked to uh yes you want recapturing services the moment you click on this text you can always check this checkbox but if you don't have this label tag let me let me remove this for attribute the moment i remove this for attribute what will happen is clicking this text will no longer check the checkbox you will have to check it like this but i don't want that i want my users to be able to check the check box when they're clicking on the text so i'll use label and for so this is the standard template for a form you can say and you can always use it if you want and in your production websites you might want to use action is equal to something which will take all the data to the back end but we are not covering back end here i'll definitely come up with more back-end videos soon i already have a django codes but again if you um if you want to use back-end like php node.js please go ahead and you can do that let's move on to the next question let us see what next question says i have deleted the pdf not deleted i have actually closed the pdf so let me open it once again and the last question says create a table displaying score of cricket players in a match using html and for this i am simply going to use a table and i already have a table here i think i created in table2.html and i'm going to use this template let me say 0 6 underscore pr04.html and i hope that i'm numbering all these uh problems correctly i think i have not numbered them correctly i should have said pr03 here so let me say pr03 here because this is the solution to problem number three i want i want to mark all these um all these files correctly so that you can always use them now i just saved it the title says stable but i'll say cricket or ipl final scores ipl final scores and the moment i do that i'll show you something i'll say final scores in ipl [Applause] and i'll simply write some of the player names i'll say ms dhoni and then i'll say virat kohli then also venkatesh here vang katesh and the moment i do that i can always uh change these values so these are the table rows these are table columns let me uh put in some of the uh scores and the moment i do that their scores will be displayed i know that i'm not using a a very good format to do this but again i'm just solving the question for the sake of solving it i'm not reading a production website at this point okay so the moment i save it and i open into the live server you'll see that this looks like this final scores and ipl i know this is not looking very fancy but once again um i want to remove this calls pen attribute by the way let me remove this call spin attribute i don't want i don't want to use this call span here so you can see that these codes are displayed like this and you can always change the format of the table and it will display anything you want but again this this is a template this is the solution to this question so i hope that you enjoyed this practice set we now move on to chapter number five and explore more about html now this is going to be the last chapter of our html course i'm going to open this chapter and this is going to be the bonus chapter this is not a must but once again if you want to take your website live online and you want your search ranking on google's to be good and competitive you need to learn seo seo is something that you cannot ignore if you want to make money from your website if you are going to write a blog or you want some sort of web presence on google or other search engines let's start with this topic but before starting this topic i want to tell you something seo is not a magic some people think that seo is magic and they can simply take their website with no value at number one in google search using seo no that doesn't work like that seo is simply a way to tell search engines what value you are providing let's say i'm writing a blog and i am hosting that blog on 199.77.88.121 colon 8000 this is the address this is the ip address of my blog i'm not using a domain i'm not using a title i'm simply using a text file i'm not even using html but my content has a lot of value it provides all the solution to the problems let us say corresponding to class 12 physics or class 11 physics will my blog get the number one rankings on google search obviously not because google will not be able to index my website better it will not even be able to recognize my page as a website because it's simply a text file so what should i do i should have a minimal seo on my website to get some attention from google so if you want some attention from google bing and other search engines you need to use seo that's about the seo it's not some sort of magic it's not like simply pay for seo hire an seo expert and they can take your website to number one no that doesn't work like that okay your website should have some value and if it has some value then seo might be useful for you okay so let's start with seo we will focus only on html standpoint of seo because seo is a really very vast topic and this by no means is a complete seo course this is simply a chapter in our html course because i feel that you should learn about seo if you are learning to build websites and if you are starting out this is a very good way to teach you seo by appending a bonus chapter at the end of the html code so we will not be looking into the keyword building content optimization and site speed page speed insights the cls uh first contextual paint all those things no we are not going to look into all those things we are going to look into on-page seo so there are two types of seos on-page seo off-pages you on because you are something that can be done by html developers that can be done by web developers rather because at some point your content will be pulled out from some sort of database so what is html seo html developers can implement seo using the following techniques these are the techniques which can be used by html developers to do the seo so they can set the title very nice and to the point they can set the meta description they can set a nice url slug they can set the meta keywords meta author they can use a fab icon so i'll be opening this folder in vs code so i'll go to open with code and i'll create a website seo.html okay so this is a basic html page the very first thing that you need to do in order to incorporate seo into your website is to set the title now this might sound really very obvious but if your title is on point then google will be able to tell users what your website is about i hope that makes sense so let us say our website is about shoes best shoes in guru now in gurugram okay now let us say my page contains information about some shoes i'll simply say best shoe shop okay best shoes shop let us say i'm talking about some shoe shops lorem 23 this will give me some dummy text to put let me open this in live server uh yeah this is how it looks so i have set the title and you can see that there is an icon occurring beside my title i have not said this icon then why is this icon appearing over here this icon is appearing over here because the file that is in the root folder has the name fab icon dot ico and when you use this name what happens is that your browser will automatically find this file and it will use it to place it here okay so this is an image that will be used by the browsers and this really looks good if you go to some website like google or even if you go to say bootstrap getbootstrap.com you can see that they use web icon and this really improves user experience because they can know what your website is about they can simply look at the tab and they can easily make out which website is open on the browser so this is really very helpful and anything which is helpful to the user is adding value to the user's life is good for seo if you're writing better content if your content is providing value if the user is getting value from your content then yes it your your user will be happy and your website will get traffic but again you will have to do something on page in order to tell google or other search engines that your website is about shoes and your website is talking about this thing and this is the basic description of your website let us say i search best shoes and the moment i do that what will happen is uh there will be some of the shoes which will show up and this is the first website that pops up okay now can you see this description this description is the meta description now some search engines might want to use meta description or they might want to generate their own meta description using your page but you should definitely put some meta description so let's move ahead and put the meta description in order to put the meta description what we'll do is we'll simply type meta and we'll choose this meta desc and this will automatically put the description now i can put this description in place of in place of this blank content is equal to will be the description and this description will be used by the search engines to be displayed here now this is a meta description for this website this is a better description for this website once again your description which you have provided inside the meta tag might not be used by the websites but again it's your duty to provide it and it's a good seo practice to provide it okay which is why we have provided it now what i'll do is i'll add another meta tag which is meta keywords and uh i'll simply use meta name is equal to kw and i'll say shoes best shoes better shoes guru grab shoes and so on i can put some of the keywords in but do not stuff keywords which are not related to your page it's not a good practice and some of the people see that using meta keyword tag is not a good practice these days because people are using these keywords um with with a very bad intention they just want to get their website ranked and they simply put the keywords which are not even related to the site and they simply put the trending keywords which is why search engines are not looking uh looking at these keywords meta tag the way they used to look at before okay let us look into another meta tag we have talked about meta description the first technique was setting the title this is very obvious but again your title should be on point because title is the thing which is which is displayed here this low price offer on footwear for men this is the title of this page this is the title of this page so you should definitely set title very nicely okay now let us move on and um set a nice url slug this is very important now what does this mean now if i open this icons page or example page from this bootstrap website you can see that this is a slug docs examples a better example might be this let me open some some website let me open this one now if you look at this website you can see that best sneakers men this is the slug for this url now your url should be able to give some idea to the user on what your content is about now this might not sound as important as it actually is but again you should use your slug such that whenever somebody is looking at your url they should get some idea on what your content is about okay so this this was about the url slug now set the meta keyword stack we just talked about it set the meta author tag now again if your website is written by some author you can use meta author tag and meta author tag let me let me use it i'll say name is equal to author and i'll say content is equal to you can set the author name inside the meta tag which will give search engines and information on which author has written this page then again set a fab icon we already talked about it you should have a file called fab icon ico which will be displayed here and here and here even google is using this five icon file even this website men's health is using this web icon file so this is very important now compress images and other resources this is something that you should do from your backend or you might want to do it before hosting your website this is not an html part of web development but again it's optimization part you should compress your images so that people are able to use your image or rather your website with a lot of images using low data bandwidth once again a very important thing because your users will be happy if they are not using a lot of data and if the internet connection of your users is slow then they will be able to load all the resources and images very optimally now if there is some html css or javascript files on your web page which are not being used or which are taking a lot of space you should compress them and you should remove a new html css in javascript now we have talked about images as well you should add all text to images so that your search engines are able to know what an image is about and they might use it for indexing your page because your page might contain some image and you might want to tell search engines what a particular image is about for example if i open this website they might want to tell search engines that this particular image is talking about a shoe this is a shoe image this particular image is about a particular type of shoe this particular image is about some type of shoe and you might want to mention all those things uh in all alt attribute of image tag okay now that's about seo we don't have a practice set for this chapter because this is a very simple and straightforward thing i just wanted to add this chapter as a bonus i hope you like this html course i want you to practice a lot you should start building websites the very next thing you might want to learn should be css css is very important and css will change the way you look at websites because you will be able to design beautiful websites using css if you want me to cover css on this channel let me know i'll be creating a video on css as well until then take care thank you so much guys for watching this video and i will see you next time [Music] you
bhIK5gB5BDQ,in this video we'll see how to create a wordpress website using elementor cloud creating a wordpress website is super simple we all know that but in this video we are going to see how we can unlock the powers of elementor cloud why it is important and what kind of convenience does it give you over simple wordpress on a server or let us say elementor on a server we'll see what elementor cloud exactly is and why this is the wordpress of the future after this video you'll know what elementor cloud brings to the table will see all the features like free ssl free cloud fare free cdn and the blazing fast speed it offers a demo is 1000 words so we'll go to the computer screen and we'll start exploring elementor cloud now let's talk about what exactly is elementor cloud if you click the link in the description you'll go to this website which is from elementor cloud and this is something amazing it is a hosted wordpress website ready for you assume that you have to start with wordpress you will need a server you'll install wordpress on that server and again you will run into a lot of issues if you are a beginner or if you are somebody who has not deployed 1020 wordpress websites elementor is amazing we all know our good old elementor which is used to build websites and you can see this animation on the elementor page it clearly shows what elementor is capable of so this is the elementor website which shows you how you can use elementor cloud so elementor cloud is a cloud service from elementor which will include everything you need add a single place you will get the cdn you will get the hosted website on google cloud platform and since they are giving you the hosting definitely this is paid but again even if you are hosting wordpress on the server you will definitely spend at least 99 so in my opinion this is a great thing so i went ahead and bought this service for my next blog and i just wanted to share how i'm setting everything up now why use elementor you might ask elementor is something that i've been using since a very long time i am not a big fan of creating uh something which i have already created from scratch i can definitely write a blog in flask i can definitely write a blog in django and i sometimes do it purposefully but again when you want to get started quickly or if i want somebody to get started quickly my friend asked me hey honey can you build a website for me what is what i tell them is just go for wordpress go for element just start writing focus on what you need to focus on focus on the quality content focus on how and what you are writing not on building the entire website if that makes sense so you can simply click the link in the description and get started with elementor cloud so i'll quickly complete the purchase and get back so this is the home page that elementor cloud shows me once i've created a website this is the elementor cloud home page what i'll do is i'll click on the create cloud website to create my first elementor cloud website and i'll punch in the name my code blog now this name is completely random let me tell you you can always go to godaddy and what i recommend is you choose a name which might be available as a domain now what i mean by that is you can simply go to godaddy search for my code blog and if your domain is available well and good nothing can be better than that because you can always take this website to a serious level to a point where you are earning some money from this website and it is very much doable using wordpress let me tell you so if i choose my name as the codetips.com this domain is available so what i'll do is i'll change this to the code tips and i'll proceed clicking on next now your website domain will be this that's totally fine i'll click got it i'll go to the next step by clicking on next what kind of website are you creating i'm creating a blog so what i'll do is i'll simply choose blog from the list of options and click next that is giving me some templates this is amazing feature from elementor cloud they simply show you all the uh templates available so you don't have to tweak all the nuts and bolts so you don't have to start from scratch you can always choose a template i'm going to choose this one but before that i'm going to see what's inside now health and mindfulness blog is something that i already know about i'm already aware of this blog and what i'll do is simply use this template and after previewing it an ipad and mobile phone in different sort of devices i found out that this is the best template for my blog so what i'll do is simply use this template and proceed in order to proceed with this template all you need to do is simply click on start with this kit so i'll click here start with this kit and i will be proceeding it's taking some time let it take its time the time will definitely be worth it and yeah creating your wordpress site setting up your dashboard uh now i can tell you from my experience that this process takes a bit of time so allow it some time and it will definitely take you to your wordpress dashboard and you'll be very happy so let's give it some time i'll wait for this to finish up and be back very soon all right so this is how my website looks at this point liver balance life popular post shows nothing no problems recent health shows nothing no problems mindfulness also shows nothing that's not a problem at all because we are going to see how to make this work okay so what i'm doing is opening my wordpress dashboard in a new tab this is how it looks amazing fresh dashboard feeling what i'll do is i'll simply go to customize or rather edit with elementor so you don't have to remember all these options let me tell you you can simply look at the menu presented to you and that many will tell you what to do when to do how to do okay so uh what i'll do is i simply want some posts there there is another column here what i'll do is delete this particular column so i'm pressing the delete key and also what i'll do is simply click on this pencil and it shows me how many columns do you want so i'm selecting one now again let me do one thing what i'm doing is simply wanting all the popular posts to show up here okay so in order to do that what you need to do is go to query and simply you can include a term i'll remove this term i'll remove this term now what i've done is i have removed the term from here now what i'll do is i'll simply go to layout and i'll choose the number of post as five okay now five posts are going to show up here and i'll choose number of column as five now five posts will show up like this okay but there is another column here i want to get rid of this column so what i'll do is i'll right click on this column and i'll simply say delete so this is how my website will look now before updating if i was to show you my website i'll open it in a new tab and i want to show you one more setting which is site lock what i'll do is i'll simply copy this website i'll open an incognito tab i'll simply press enter and what you'll see is that this website is no longer accessible this is a feature this is not a bug let me tell you what is going to happen is elementor will say hey who is this who is trying to access this website if admin has given you the access tell me the pin code now where is the pin code your pin code is inside your elementor dashboard okay so if i scroll down i'll show you the pin code without even revealing the pin code i can copy it which is a good feature so if my friend is sitting beside me i don't have to show him the pin code i'll simply paste it and click continue and that person will be able to see the website now before i pressed update this is how the website looks after i press update button here i'll simply update it all the popular post will show up now who has written these blog posts this is something that elementor gave me out of the box so if i click here you will see let me reload this and once i reload all the popular post will show up i'm waiting for it to refresh it takes some time and yeah it shows all the post which is amazing this website looks good now so i can change this i can change the number of post here i can actually show a particular category let me show you how to do that i can simply scroll down and let us say i want to show all the post with category mindfulness i'll click here i'll go to query and after going to query what i'll do is i'll simply say i want to show only the post with category mindfulness okay let me simply search mindfulness and it will show me a dropbox oops mindfulness mindfulness okay i'll select this category now only the post with category mindfulness will show up here okay which is an amazing feature now i can do the same thing here i can do the same thing here i can create this website like a regular wordpress website let me press update and if i reload this website you will simply see that this particular section is updated now only post with category mindfulness are being shown okay this is coming from the template if i open this post you will see this post and amazing you get a free domain you get free ssl i think this is going to be a wordpress game changer amazing because you don't have to manage everything all you need to do is pay 99 or something to elementor uh and voila you have the website out there okay now you can change all these logo and all using a wordpress dashboard you can always click here and do all those things but again this is how you build a wordpress website using elementor cloud which is amazing now let's say i want to add a post let me add it uh where is my add new post it said i'll simply say how to build a wordpress website or something okay it's opening up and yeah so i'll say how to build a wordpress website and simply i'll say this is sorry this is how you build a wordpress website okay now i'll simply publish this post yes i want to publish it i know this doesn't look good but again let me publish it i'll reload this page and you will see that this post will show up somewhere uh okay so so this post is showing up here okay i don't have an image here so it is showing up like this if you will add an image it will show up like this okay this is amazing nice all right so this is the home page that is being shown to me by elementor i've built a website i've done everything now i'll show you the belts and whistles that elementor cloud offers so if you have a website or more than one websites they all will show up here now this is the site lock is on if i click on the code tips it will open this the code tips dot element cloud website for me this website is opening for me but the moment i open this website in an incognito tab this will start asking me a pin code and this is where sitelock comes in so the site lock simply says while you're developing your website nobody will be able to see your website anybody who has a pin code will still be able to see your website so if you are building your website or you are testing your website among few friends or among few teammates you can always turn the site lock on now if you click on manage this website you can always turn the site lock off which means that your website will be public so unlocking your site means that visitors and search engines can access your site so make sure whenever you are planning to go live you turn the site lock off for now i am not turning my site lock off i'll copy my pin code and i'll paste the pin code i'll click on continue and my website will be visible so i'm waiting for the website to load and you can see that my website is visible now let us say i want to edit a post on my website let us say i want to edit how to build a wordpress website i'll simply go to uh my wordpress dashboard so let me reload this uh i'll simply click on websites and open wp dashboard this will open my wp dashboard which is my wordpress dashboard waiting for my wordpress dashboard to open and you'll be able to do anything you are able to do in wordpress okay so if you open pages you can always add pages if you open post you can add a new post or you can edit existing post i am going to edit this one so i'll simply say edit and what i'll do is i'll simply add an image okay so i'll show you how to add an image so i'll click on this featured image select the featured image i'll go to media library and i'll choose this image let us say i'll choose a random one i'll click on set featured image now what will happen is the moment i update and reload my page the featured image will show up here as you can see so i can always add a new post this is something that you will do all the time adding a new post a new page is something that you will keep on adding because that's how your blog grows right you keep on adding the post and you keep on adding the content and the featured image and this is how your blog will get a lot of visitors now i'll show you something can you see this user six two seven two seven four ee zero three two one e i want to change this so i'll simply go to users and i'm going to edit this user so i'll click edit and i'll simply change this user something something nickname to harry and display name publicly as harry not this okay and i will update profile the moment i update profile and reload you'll see the name will be changed to harry here i'm waiting for this to reload and yeah so you'll definitely want your name to be uh something and not user xx yy zz something like that okay so the site lock is on what i'll do now is i'll turn off my site log so that everybody will be able to see my website so i'll do one thing i'll close the incognito tab and i'll go to my i simply clicked on manage this website by the way and i will simply turn off the site log sometimes if you're creating a new account it will ask you to confirm your email so you'll have to confirm your email before your site will go live i'll simply click on unlock site this takes some time and it is still showing me this loading if let me wait for the site to go live it takes some time a minute or something or 30 seconds so it took less than a minute and my site lock is off which means that i should be able to access my website so i'm clicking the domain provided by elementor cloud to me i'll open an incognito tab and i'll try to access this blog and it should load uh yeah it is loading so this elementor cloud basically provides you a lot of features and cdn is one of those so what cdn will do is it will make your website blazingly fast your website will be cached at different locations by different servers which actually speeds up your website and reduces loading time so you can always change this liver balance life you can always change the category of your blog you can always change all these categories health health health mindfulness i'll show you how to do that you can always do that in your wordpress dashboard you can go to post and then you can go to categories and you will be able to edit or add a new category okay so i'm waiting for this to load and so this is where you'll be able to change all the categories you can add a new category another thing that i like about elementor cloud is that they have dedicated wordpress support team and a dedicated team for you to set up elementor cloud so i was running into some issues to be honest when i was starting out because i didn't know where a particular setting is and these people actually helped me a lot so the support is great and i've not tried wordpress support to be honest but i assume this will be great since the support from their elementor cloud website is great so yeah this is how you set up a wordpress website using elementor cloud you can always add a custom domain when your blog reaches to a serious level i will suggest that you add a custom domain and adding a custom domain should be simple as well so they are simply saying that you go to your hosting and simply add these two records go to your domain provider and make sure your domain is updated with the cname or a record from your default elementor domain okay so if you add these two then you can add your custom domain and this should work and these things are super simple you just have to follow and uh their support will help you if you're not able to do that so this is great another feature is backups you can always take a backup you can export a backup you can restore your website to an original state and you don't have to pay anything extra for this so this is amazing and a lot of other features are yet to be explored by me i'm still using it let's see how it goes so this is my blog the codetips.elementor.cloud and i'm definitely going to buy a domain for this and set this up so let us change the site logo i'll simply click on this hamburger i'll go to site settings and after going to site settings it'll show me site identity i'll click on site identity and i'll simply choose a site logo let me keep this as a site logo i'll click on insert media and i'll do the same thing with site fab icon i'll say insert media i'll click on update it says your changes have been updated i'll click on back to editor and yeah i think my site logo and my fav icon should be there now let me reload this page so yeah it shows up here i can always click on edit header and i'll be able to edit my header but again if you see this page you'll see that the site logo is here and the site fab icon is here amazing good stuff so i hope that you were able to understand how elementor works and why is it a very good and secure alternative to hosting wordpress on your server or some other hosting platform so this is something which is great and i'll simply close the dashboard now i'll simply double check if my website is working i'll click on my code tips and you'll see how speedy your website gets once it is visited by some number of users you can see that this website is super fast i'll click on this blog post and this blog post will be loaded yes it does and again i'll go to the home page and i'll go to this page and yeah this works amazing good stuff i have not edited the content by the way but you can always add the content and you can share this on facebook you can share this on twitter this theme gives me everything so you cannot focus directly on your content you can focus on writing good blog post and the rest everything will be taken care of by elementor now before we go what i want to do is i'm going to show you how backup works in element so i'll simply click on manage this website and let us try to explore all the features from elementor cloud what i'll do is i'll scroll down and i'll simply try to restore my website to the point when it was 5th may 2022-73 so let me click on restore it will tell me i understand my website will be unavailable until restore is complete that makes sense i understand that site management and editing will not be available i understand that visitors to my site will view a site down message from elementor no problems i'll simply click on yes restore and it will restore my site now i'll tell you something so when your site is backed by a cdn it will be cached at different locations let me make a google search on cdn i'll find some image so what basically happens is throughout the world there are different regions where cdn will be having its servers so let us say this is the cdn server one this is cdn server two three four and so on practically there will be a lot of cdn servers so your website will be cached so let us say somebody is asking for a blog post where you have written about how to lose weight in 10 days something like that so what will happen is your page will be served by the cd and it will not go to your actual server actual database it will simply serve you the cached content so even if your site is down due to this restore it will actually not impact your visitors it will not have any significant impact on the people visiting your website so it is definitely taking some time so i'll give it its time honestly speaking that was pretty fast within a minute i was able to restore my website let me see how my website looks before i even think of doing something so the post that was added to my website is no longer available here because i have restored my website even the site logo that we added has been disappeared because we had not at that time added the site logo which totally makes sense and let us now try to explore more options so this is the url of my site elementor cloud website hosted it gives me the id and managed domain instruments are the addresses visitors use okay that makes sense it gives you a free ssl which means you don't have to worry about buying an actual ssl certificate and you can add custom domains which is great there is a record it tells me that your data center is in belgium not a problem because i'm anyway using cdn now sitelock i already told you about that backups we actually took one just a minute back now this is debugging and troubleshooting panel which i don't think a lot of you will be using because again you'll not be debugging wordpress errors a lot when you're working with elementor cloud and even if you run into some problem what i recommend is talk to these people don't try to randomly do stuff on your website because you might break things up simply go to the wordpress support or the the better option is go to backups and simply restore your website to say three days back or four days back and manually add all those posts up if that makes sense and if you're trying to do something magical installing say 10 plugins 20 plugins all of a sudden what i recommend is simply click on create a new backup and let me let me simply type imp this is an important backup so i'll say imp this is my important backup so it will take the backup this will take some time and we'll take the backup for you and now you can try experimenting the you know adding plugins doing some stuff which you think might break your website up you can try all those things and if even if it breaks your website you can always come back to this imp backup and restore your website it's pretty simple so in my opinion elementor cloud saves a lot of time but again i'm still using it and let's see how it goes anyway it's a new product from elementor my backup is complete and i should be able to see the backup here which is great i mean this is amazing i can even export my backup i think it will give me some file to download export okay so it just gave me a notification soon you will receive an email with the download link wow so nobody can steal your data by logging into your uh elementor cloud dashboard this is also great i mean i like it so yeah so that was all about elementor cloud so you can definitely go ahead try the link in the description and start using elementor cloud if you haven't already and without any doubt you can definitely purchase this you will never regret it i can tell you if you are anywhere trying to use wordpress go for elementor cloud because anyway you are going to spend this amount of money on a hosting it's better to do that on elementor cloud because you get all these bunch of amazing options so that was all about the video thank you so much guys for watching this video and i will see you next time [Music] you
zg1PacxR4r8,in our previous video we saw how we can add a virtual environment and make a django app better better in the sense of deployment we can deploy it anytime any way we want with the same set of python packages that we were using before so we documented all the packages inside this requirements.txt file and we'll be adding the packages that we use in this django app inside this file if i fire python py run server you'll see that i have this uh development server created and i can very easily navigate okay so what i'll do is i'll simply add a slasher and then i'll say admin and i think i've already created an account yes the username was harry and the password was harry and and it's totally fine we had some blocks in there we had some contact objects in there and i think it was pretty good and we are ready to deploy it because we are very nicely in shape to add content here we can paste in images we can do a lot of stuff with this okay so there are few things that i want to change though do you remember we added tiny mce to our blog by using blog.js let's say i want to copy an image and i'm going to paste it to tinymce so for that we have a setting in tiny mce i don't know what it is but i'll search it for you tiny mce uh paste image i think it's something like paste image true or something you just have to add one additional entry and you have to tell tinymce that i'm going to paste some uh images inside this and please take care of that ah yeah paste data images let me copy this and let me add it to my tinymce configuration so here's my vs code i'll add it and then i'll add a comma let me save it and i'll show you what it does so if i come back to my django administration and let's say i want to structure this jquery tutorial for beginners really well so what i'll do is i'll simply come here and i'll copy an image let me see if i can copy an image from somewhere let us say jquery let me call it jquery and let me open image let me copy image and let me see if i can paste it so once i press ctrl v i can paste data images in this and it'll be great for me to you know save it and see the same image as a base64 so this is added as a base64 image if you don't know where base64 images i think that's totally fine all you care about at this point is to see this jquery tutorial image here but i haven't added it inside jquery tutorial it seems or there is some issues if i save it jake okay so i have two jquery tutorials for beginners let me call it jquery tutorial for beginners to let me come back to blog let me click on next and yes we have this image here so we can add a lot of images we can also add uh add the code so if i add code like this i'll press enter and i don't have all the features here so let me come back to tinymce documentation and they have a page wherein they show all the features i'll come to example and yes this is the one fully featured so there are two types of fully featured one is including premiere plugins we don't want to deal with this one what we are interested in is fully featured non-premium plugins now i'm not discouraging you not to buy this but i think free is just fine to get started so once i add this javascript to my tiny mce configuration i'll i'll see this uh all these options in my django admin for this blog okay so what i'll do is i'll come to js and i'll select all these things from starting to the very end i'll copy them and i'll add to my tiny mce so i'll remove this and i'll not add selector and i'll also not add uh another thing paste data images let me see if they have paste data images set to something else they might have it set to false and i need to ensure this paste data images okay so they don't have it so i need it let me save it and i'll tell you something that i learned through experience that if you are facing any difficulty in getting this update all you have to do is press control plus shift plus r control plus shift plus r will hard reload and it will bring in all the fresh files from your static directory okay but for me the normal reload worked well or you can also restart the server and you can clear the browser cache and you will see but that is a difficult way a shortcut is to press ctrl shift and r and once you do that i think it works really great okay so you can see this semicolon here if i click this semicolon and if i say i want to add some code and let's say i want to add python code and let me add this views dot py let me copy this views.py and let me paste it here and once i save you can see it's so beautifully aligned here i can simply click on save and let me see if it is reflected here yes it is reflected here now there is a library called prism.js let me show you you can add it if you want but for now i'm going to skip it because i want to see my blog and deployed as soon as possible okay so you can see this prism js library it is really very beautiful this is how your um your code will look like if you have prism enabled on your blog so i like uh where is my monokai theme i think it's called okay idea this is this is monokain sublime it's they call it okay i don't know whether i'm pronouncing it correct or not but i think this really looks cool and clean to me so i use this and you can simply scroll down and use cdn or you can simply download however you want to use it okay let me skip this for now because i don't want to make it difficult for you to deploy this vlog let us deploy this blog as is let us assume that this looks perfectly fine okay and this actually looks fine if you want to just publish some posts and once you have 30 40 posts on your blogs you can simply change the formatting and you can make it look good there are a lot of things that we can do we can add some social media icons we can make it better in ipad mobile phones and all those things but i think it's fine bootstrap has already done that for us but i'm just trying to tell you that you can customize your blog later for now we'll focus on deployment so let's get to the point of deploying the site all we want to do is to deploy this site now you must be thinking why are you telling me how to deploy this site can't we just drop in the files into the server and simply run python manage dot py run server in the background and it should work just fine yes you are right it will work just fine but there are some issues with that but before that let me tell you what kind of hosting is available for django now if you if you're serious with your blog and you really want to see this app deployed in production and you expect say 20 30 000 of visitors visiting your blog and reading your blog and you cannot expect any downtime or any kind of issues with your site you need a dedicated vps now there are some more complicated deployment methods like kubernetes docker i don't want you to get into all this if you are starting new uh if you are starting with django and you are not a devops engineer it's really straightforward for you to use a vps now what is a vps if you don't know what a vps is vps stands for virtual private server virtual private server means a computer a machine which is there in the cloud somebody has already purchased that machine for you and they can provide access of this machine to you if you pay them dollars oh yes nothing is free okay so once i type vps one two three four these four people want to like party they're saying please take vps from me this guy's saying please take it from me these guys think please please take it from me why because virtual private server is something that makes them a lot of money but we don't want to dive deep into how they are making money all we want is a good vps you can go with hostgator you can go with lynnode you can go with anything i'm telling you every provider which obviously you know is not a scammer is good okay you need to make sure that you are not dealing with scammers if somebody is listed on page one in google they are definitely not scammers and these companies are pretty famous right linord hostinger and we can rely on these what i personally use is if you want to ask me what i personally prefer and what i have been using since years is digit lotion so digital ocean offers a lot of products it offers a lot of product it's not just about vms one of their products is vm i use this because i like it you might not be interested in this but it's just a matter of company it's just a company which is dealing with that if you want to follow this tutorial as is you can buy delete lotion i'll drop my referral link in the description what that will do is that will help you get hundred dollar free indeed lotion so if you get hundred dollars to start with i think that is amazing you can deploy your website i think for a few months six eight months for free all it cost is five dollars per month because we are just getting started we don't have 100 000 visitors visiting our website okay so how to get started so in order to make this process easy for you what i've done is i've already logged into my ddlotion account this is my daily lotion account i have a lot of production droplets and i have a lot of a servers but once you click on my referral link in the description and you create an account you will be redirected to an account creation page and i think you need to add a payment method you will not get charged you'll only have to add a payment method and once you add the payment method they'll give you hundred dollars and for hundred dollars you can deploy your application for say uh for a lot of time and you can check the terms and conditions i'm not sure but yes you get something for free and it is amazing yes it is amazing so let us do something here let us get started with a droplet so what i'll do is i'll simply click here create and then i'll choose droplets what is the droplet droplet is a fancy name for vm and this is a name given by digilotion they call their vms as droplets now this is not a concept but droplet is something exactly it's exactly same as virtual machine it's not even similar it's it's the virtual machine okay so i'm choosing ubuntu 18 because it's pretty good and another reason for choosing ubuntu 18 and i should say another personal reason of choosing ubuntu 18 is they have very nice guides written all over the internet and i really like the guide so digitalocean has a lot of stuff on the internet then they are asking me to choose a plan uh keep it standard now here you need to choose five dollar a month because we don't expect a lot of traffic to our website so five dollar a month you'll do just fine believe me now what i'll do is i'll select a server here you can select the nearest server to you i'll select bangalore because i live in india and it's nearest server to me but you need to make sure that the server is as nearer to your visitors as possible it will not matter much but it's it's a good choice it makes sense to choose a server which is physically near to your visitors okay choosing a server in amsterdam or new york will not harm me significantly but you got the point okay you can choose whatever you want but i prefer to choose whatever is nearer to me now here it will ask you to create a password you can create any password of your choice what i'll do is i'll create a password code with harry123 and after creating a password what i'll do is i'll create this password i think this password looks good okay so i'll choose this password or maybe i'll choose some different password because last time i created a vm some nasty people hacked into the vm and not even hacked into the vm they use the password from the video and they did some nasty stuff and i don't want to discuss that here but i need to choose a different password what i'll do is i'll choose a different password which i'll not show you and what i'll do is i'll keep some host name then i'll click create droplet and my droplet will be created and i'll be back all you have to do is fill in a password choose a host name or you can keep it as default but you can choose a new host name with your name or something else and then what you have to do is click on create droplet and this will create a droplet i will create my droplet and get back all right guys so i just set up this virtual machine i named it as code with harry test and this is the ip address and what i'll do now is i'll show you how to deploy your django application to this server now how do we log into the server you can use terminal of your choice if you have ubuntu already i am on windows as you can see if you have ubuntu or you are on mac os it will be straightforward for you to use terminal and ssh even if you are on windows powershell it will be very easy for you you can simply go to windows powershell and all you have to do is you have to copy this ip and after copying this ip address all you have to do is you have to say ssh and then you can say root add the rate and then your ip address you can use ctrl v to paste and then it will ask you to um whether you want to verify this fingerprint or not you just say yes and all you have to do now is i'll just enter the password and bingo i'm inside the droplet so this is how it looks like and now we are inside that virtual machine which is provided to us by digitalocean okay so i hope everyone is here so far if you are not here make sure this is free you can go to the description you can you know take the link take the referral link and you will get hundred dollars for free and you can deploy play around and once your referral bonus is over you can actually pay and deploy your websites because nobody is going to give you deploying for free and with unlimited bandwidth because how would they earn if you if they give it to you for free there are some free hosting services to be honest but they are not scalable nobody will give you compute for free okay make sure that now we are inside this ubuntu droplet all i want to do is i want to ensure that i have everything that is needed to deploy a django application so what i typically do is i go to google and i say how to deploy a django app in ubuntu vps and guess what digitalocean pops up okay and i'll also write ubuntu 18 because this is the operating system that i'm using and i look for the relation guide now i use apache server but we can use any server we want we can use nginx as well but i like apache server it's really great and it's easy to use so what i'll do is i'll click here and you can see it's showing me ubuntu 16 guide which will work just fine but i want to find some updated guide from digitalocean ubuntu 18.04 i hope they have a guide on one to 18.04 deployment and even if they don't have it we will move forward with this because the windows 16 works just fine okay and i'll guide you with everything so since we are using python 3 uh first we need to do uh apt update so apt update will pull in all the updated packages and it just updates all the index and once this app update has been finished what i'll do is i'll run this command so let me copy this and let me paste this and once it runs i'll tell you what it does so why and then you have to you'll have to press enter it's asking you do you want to continue or not you'll have to say yes i want to continue let me tell you what this is this is a mod of apache so this is something that you need along with apache so this is mod wsgi that we are adding to the apache server and we need this just because we need to install our django application to apache but before this we also need apache installed into our server so for that what i do is um i go to internet and i say digital ocean plus lampstack setup now what is lamp stack you must be thinking now lam stack stands for linux apache mysql and php linux you know linux is an operating system apache is a server mysql is a database and php is something we need for phpmyadmin now you must be thinking what is phpmyadmin but let us install it okay so i'll click on this resolution guide and it is for 1 to 18 which is a good news for us but even if it is for ubuntu 16 we can i look into the commands that it is issuing and they work just fine and if we run into any problems i am there for you we we will fix them okay so apt update and then they are installing apache too so ideally before this you can fire this because apache 2 is a server and we are installing this mod on top of apache 2 but since i've already installed this mod not an issue what i'll do is i'll paste or i'll type simply apt install apache 2 y enter okay so it's saying that apt install apache 2 the following package was automatically installed and is no longer required okay so here's the thing so apache 2 is already the newest version so if you install this apache mod it will automatically install apache for you which is a good news that's fine okay now what we want to do is we want to allow the incoming traffic so what we do is we fire this command to see the list of available applications and a simple right click will paste it into the terminal and now what i'll do is i'll simply allow incoming traffic to this apache full profile if you want to see what is inside this profile you can fire this command but we are finding this command just to see what is there in this profile copy paste and we show uh okay so i think i pasted something something wrong i should be copying this and i should be pasting this like this okay so it's telling me that apache v2 is the next generation of the omni present apache web server okay sounds good i want to allow the incoming traffic so if i copy this and if i paste it to the terminal it's saying rule updated so we can now see incoming traffic to apache 2. so let us verify this let us go to this ip oh yes it works so we can see this apache to ubuntu default page which is a good news for us okay so now what i'll do is i'll simply go back to that guide which was showing me how to install lamp i want to finish up installing lamp stack oh yes we saw this page which means the install works now what it is telling me is install my sequel now we don't have to install mysql because we are not using this uh my sequel thing but we'll come back and install my sequel latest so this is not a proper lamp stack installation to be honest what i'll do is i'll come down i'll not even install php because i don't even need php so let us not worry about these things we'll come back in some other video and do it at this point my only focus is to somehow deploy this application in as less amount of time as possible okay let me copy this one pip3 install virtual env you know what virtually nv is now right so pip3 install virtual env it installs virtual environment yes it did now what i'll do is i will come back to a new tab why i want to install filezilla ftp so all you have to do is you have to say filezilla ftp and you'll have to download this piece of software now what is the software for this software is for uploading files to the server now if you are using it already you can do git pull but if you want to manually transfer files to your server you need an ftp client so what you can do is click download filezilla client and it will download it for you now i can click this download filezilla client and then wait for it to download i think it's downloading okay so you can click here do not buy anything and do not buy anything accidentally most importantly i'll click this close and will open this piece of software and install it and come back i already have filezilla installed so i don't have to do any further steps let me wait for it to finish so it has finished downloading and now it's opening you can allow it and run the installer and it it will install this piece of software so i'll cancel because i already have this installed i'll open my filezilla ftp and after opening my filezilla by clicking on start you'll see that i have this thing over here okay what i need to do now is copy this uh ip address and paste it here and then the username is root and i'll type my password okay and then import you have to say 22 because this is the sftp port click on quick connect click on ok and this is the place where you will see your server now go to slash var slash www slash django okay or let us call it mountain because if you remember this was the name of our website so let me open this directory first slashware slash www so i'll go to this directory now what i'll do is i'll right click i'll say click directory and enter it i'll say mountain and this will create a directory called mountain the next step is to drag in all the files here so that i can upload my blog to this mountain folder let me go back to my folder this is my mountain coders folder i'll control a i'll remove this dot gate i don't want to upload dot get i don't want to upload dot vs code i also don't want to upload this my project tnv all i am worried about is blog mountain encoders this db dot sqlite let me add this db.sqlite3 as well so i'll copy these files to this server and let us wait for them to get uploaded and as you can see that they are being uploaded now if i come back to my powershell and i do cd slash var slash www slash mountain by the way you can press tab key to auto complete slash where slash www slash mountain okay so what i'll do now is i'll fire ls to see whether i have all the files that place or not let us do one thing we just installed virtual environment let us try to create my project env as a virtual environment so we have this virtual environment so what i'll do now is i'll say source my project env bin and activate this is the command so if you are on ubuntu this is the command to activate the virtual environment let me press enter and this virtual environment has been activated now what i'll do is i'll say paper install minus r requirements.txt how did i type this requirement so fast i just said r e and i press tab to autocomplete now tab key can be used to autocomplete a file which is already present in the directory so i can press enter and as you can see it's installing django it's installing pandas for no reason because i just added that pandas i don't know why did i add pandas but let it be added we are just learning django at this point do not add any additional packages they'll just be an extra overhead on your server you don't want that okay let me say python manage dot p by run server and it is saying that it works it works very nice but can i go to port 8000 and see my blog let us try that let us go back to port 8000 and i want to tell you it will not work and i'll also tell you why will it not work but let us go to the server and port 8000 it doesn't work why does it not work because we are serving a local host and this local host for a remote server is that remote server i want people to come to this particular server and access this django application okay so for that all you need to do is you need to give a command to python manage dot p by run server and what it will do is it will instead of creating a server at 127.0.0.1 it will create a server at http or rather let me call it 0.0.0.0 which means you want to connect to the server it is serving the files from the ip address which means anyone can come in and connect to the server let me press enter let me start this server and let me see whether it works let's reload so it's saying that disallowed host at invalid http host so we need to add it to allowed host i'll tell you what it means but for now what i'll do is i'll simply stop it another thing you want to do is if it doesn't work you'll have to say ufw allow 8000 because sometimes 8000 port is not allowed to your server so incoming traffic will not be able to reach your server so you need to say your w allow 8 000. currently the firewall is not active so if i do ufw enable i i can activate the firewall but i don't want to activate the firewall but in production you should be activating the firewall it is important to activate the firewall otherwise people will do um nasty things and will try to hack into your system but for the sake of this tutorial let us not enable firewall okay to keep things simple now it is saying disallowed host at http underscore host header this you may need to add this to a loud host okay so we'll follow we'll say ls we'll go to cd mountain coders will say ls will edit this settings dot py file you might as well edit an upload but what i am doing is i am directly editing this file from here after you open vim you need to press i key and i key will allow you to type inside this so i'll make this single quotes i'll copy this thing the server ip i'll copy and i'll paste i need to press ctrl v why does it not work i think i forgot to copy okay so right click is for paste i don't know what's wrong but i'll type it manually 206.189.142.61 and this is a python list by the way yes it is fine let me see if python manage dot p white and server works so cd dot dot slash for going back one directory and python manage dot py run server oh yes it works but i want to run my server like this 0.0.0.0 i hope i got it right 0.0 i think i need to make it like this and yes it should work um let's wait yes it works let me reload oh yes we can see your mountain coders blog um into production yes it works and yes it looks amazing now it's saying that there is no table called blog i think it's telling me this because i have not copied my tv dot second three i don't know why it's not copied why was it failed it was failed for some reason could not start the transfer let me reset and re-cue all right click process queue let me try to upload it again all transfers could not be finished i don't know why it's not able to upload i think i'm already using this file so this file is not readable for some reason i don't know why reset and req all process queue override so i want to upload it so yes it is uploaded now so you need to stop your development server now i think if i restart this server i should be able to see my blogs oh yes i can i can see all the blogs so it works pretty fine and it looks good wow it works it definitely works but let me tell you something let me tell you something i don't want you to deploy this application like this there are many reasons for that first of all um django's development server is not a very powerful web server so you need to use apache server now how do we use apache server let me tell you how to use it um also if your process goes down for some reason due to some error or due to os killing the process which is hosting this which is holding this application in your operating system it will be really very problematic for you so let me tell you uh how to install it how to deploy it sorry so we need to deploy it in an optimal manner let's go back to this blog where these people are telling how to serve django applications using apache okay now you can go back and read why we need apache there are n number of reasons one of those being that apache is very available and highly reliable and a powerful web server which can scale with your users and it will provide a very good experience to you your application will be highly available and you will know why we need it by spending some time in hosting your apps in production so what we'll do now is we need to add the static url and static route so let me do one thing let me stop right here and i want you to grasp the concepts that i taught in this video and once you have grasped all the concepts then i think it will be ideal for you to come back and see how to deploy the same application using apache if you want to run this in background you can simply say ampersand at the end and no hub at the starting so no hub python manage dot v run server and this thing just press enter and your blog will be deployed and i can even close this and it's still there it's still there so if you want you can take this ip address you can access it and what i'll do is i'll come back in the next video and i'll show you how to point a domain to this ip as well as how to leverage apache server for this blog okay so we'll come back in the next video and we'll see how to deploy django application using apache server this method will work just fine but not if you have a lot of users and if you need no downtime yeah if you want to have some down times yes you can go back uh your operating system might kill this process this python process this is simply a hanging python process inside your operating system and you don't want to deploy it like this you want uh apache server to take charge of your application of your web application and apache server should be able to serve the application and should take the responsibility of the uptime of your application so we'll come back and see how we add apache web server how we add apache web server and virtual environment to our vps we'll see all those things we'll do it in practical so do not worry but before that if you haven't already accessed this playlist please make sure you access this playlist because this is the place where i'm going to add all the videos this is the place where you will get all the info so please access this playlist and if you like this video please give me a thumbs up i need a lot of shares from you guys on this playlist i want a lot of people to take advantage of this course and learn all the concepts with me i hope you will share this playlist please do share this playlist thank you so much guys for watching this video and i will see you next time
al0tAGjpMO4,guys in the last video we saw the customizations we can do to tiny mce to make a rich text editor experience more and more better now what i'll do is i'll save all these images that i like and let us keep it inside the slider so inside img i will save it okay so this is my portfolio website folder what i'll do is i'll go to mount encoders folder static and let me create a directory called img and inside img let me save this with the name slider1 okay that makes sense so let me save it now one dot slider1.jpg and let me reload and see if i get a better image than this one okay so this image looks good as well let's do save image as and i'll call it slider two slider two let me see if i get another better image i think this looks good as well so let me call it slider 3 and this is a matter of choice if you don't like this website if you don't like the image you can do the customizations as and when required so i have saved all my files inside img folder of my static directory now what i'll do is i'll come back to my index.html and instead of saying source.unsplash.com what i'll do is i'll go to slash static let me say static and i'll say slash img slider1.jpg and then once again i'll do the same with slider2.jpg slider 2.jpg and once again with slider3.jpg [Applause] slider3.jpg and this should load the images that are saved so i think this looks good but again i think i changed the images at wrong place so my bad i should have changed the images inside this so no problems i'll once again do the same thing for my about section the mini about section that i have on the home page so instead of calling it slider i'll call it uh let me call it icon1 it's actually not icon so let me call this let me call it thumbnail thumbnail one thumbnail two okay but before that what i'll do is i'll have to go to unsplash.com to grab these images so thumbnail 1 thumbnail 2 and thumbnail 3 uh thumbnail 3 so the image was 160 by 160 so what i'll do is i'll go to unsplash.com and instead of going to unsplash.com i'll go to souls.unsplash.com and what i'll do is i'll copy this one not this one i just want to have a url which will give me the images by searching with search term i'll copy this i'll paste it here and my image was 160 by 160 [Applause] and i'll write coding here let me write coding here i hope it pops up a nice image for me i think this looks good uh so i'll call it thumbnail one and once again i'll reload it now once again i'll copy this urls and i will paste it here let me call apple code and once again i'll say 160 by 160 160 by 160 and let me copy this and let me see if i get better images i'll keep on firing this until i get better images i think this image is good as well so let me copy this thumbnail too and let me see if i get a better image once again i think this looks good as well thumbnail [Applause] three and let me load my website now oh yes it looks good it looks amazing plus it loads faster than before okay so this website looks clean now mount encoders and then we have this thing and then once again we have white users if you want to increase the spacing between this my choosers and the images you can do that and i have told you how to do that we have this footer all right so this website looks good now now once again if we were to make some changes to the blog page what i'll do is i'll change the max height or rather min height of this page the minimum height that it should always have it's called min hide and not max side so let me go back to this page which is blog page.html uh bloghom.html i'm sorry so what i'll do is i will add a min height to my container which is holding all these posts okay so in order to do that what i'll do is i'll see where my container is which is holding all these posts it is here container so what i'll do is i'll create a new block and i'll say block css and i'll say block css and then tab and then i'll add the extra css here but before that i'll also have to add this block css inside my base.html so let me come back to base.html let me add it here because this is the place where i want to have my extra css the css that i'm going to add and what i'll do is i will say okay so i want to start a style tag and inside the style tag what i'll do is i'll say container should have or rather dot container because i want to target the class is equal to container element and i'll say the element with class container should have a min height of min high and it has to be atvh vh is viewport height if you don't know let me reload this and once i reload this it's still hanging up here so let me make it 100 vh and i think this should fix it okay so 100 vh fixes it and we get a scroller here but i think that's totally fine because in the future we'll have a lot of posts and we'll definitely have pg nation at place and we'll see how that will work but at this moment i think we are good with this page once again we'll go to contact page and we'll do the same thing so i'll add this extra css to my contact.html as well let me do that ctrl v ctrl s to save let me reload and see the magic the magic failed why okay so i don't have any container here i'll say dev dot container and let me add this this is my contact page here let me reload this okay so this is my contact page and i have this crawler you might as well change this to 95 vh if you think it's too much but i think 100 vh works fine as well okay so let me reload this i think 90 vh should work fine as well you can tweak this as per your requirement and if you like this scroller then you can keep 90 vh otherwise you can see what is the height of this thing and you can accordingly fix the height of your container whatever it comes out to be okay but i think this corner looks cool and and in the future we are anyway going to have this crawler in our website so i think that's totally fine and this looks totally good we have a mini description we have the blog we can customize it the way we want uh we changed the links and we added the colors and i think it totally looks fine and i'm really very happy the way it looks and it is a little bit off because i think i added the code between the headings but i think that's totally fine if you want to customize it just go back to your django admin and customize it the way you want okay so i think this mountain coders look amazing now we'll come back in the next video we'll design this contact page we have already designed the blog page we will add page edition as well and then i think we'll be good with the blog so i hope you guys are liking these videos if you are please access this playlist if you haven't already done that and give me a like on this video and on the previous videos as well this is a humble request and if you can give me a few likes on my videos that would be really great so thank you so much guys for watching this video make sure you bookmark this playlist and save it by clicking here and i will see you next time you
VdYnH9z6CeY,in a previous video we saw how to design the pg nation logic in this video what i'll do is i'll come back to my website and what i'll do is i'll design this contact page we'll create a model and we'll add the ui components and then finally we'll attach this model to the ui components and then we'll see how the information that is being entered by the user in the ui can be captured by the model and be saved in the database so let's see how all this is going to work what i'll do is i'll close all the tabs and once again if you haven't already access this playlist please do it right away because this is going to be the place where i'm adding all the django videos so you should access it as soon as possible you can click here to bookmark it and you can click here to save it one more thing that i want to tell you is that i'll do things little quickly here but i'll explain you whatever i'm doing i have been doing this thing since a very long time in this course we have added a model and we created a form in our i think it was to do's list app if i'm not wrong and then we have done the same thing inside our django blog as well so let me come back to this page and let me open my templates and here is my contact template and what i'll do is i'll go to getbootstrap.com now bootstrap 5 has arrived but again i'm using bootstrap 4 because it is in the stable version at this point so let's use bootstrap 4. it's not a problem you can change the version here but it's fine you can use whatever you want you can even move to custom html css javascript with that said i'll move to forms and let me quickly grab a form which looks good i think this should be fine to start with ctrl v to paste and let me see how this looks so email address and password i don't want to capture email address and password i just want to capture a name so let me capture email of the user i'll say email email id will be email but id is not the thing which is captured by the form any backend uses the name attribute to identify the input elements so i'll say name is equal to email instead of id is equal to email you might as well keep the id but name is going to be the attribute which will be used by the backend so our model or rather i should say django view will see this thing uh this name and identify which element and which data is coming towards it okay so let me close all other tabs close tabs to the right i don't want to keep the useless steps i should not call them useless but for now it is useless because i'm working on contact.html so uh what i'll do is i'll come back here and let me see if i can grab something else from getbootstrap.com email address i think this form looks better but but it's fine i'll uh copy the components let me copy this component let me put it inside this and if you switch to html instead of django html you'll be able to format it so let me format it and instead of email address i'll say tell me your name and type is equal to text so input type is equal to text is a type is an input type and type is equal to email is an input type and then we have a password and we also have a phone and if i'm not wrong so type is equal to phone you can simply search it on the internet input type is equal to phone uh so we do have an input type is equal to we have a type is equal to tell not phone i'm sorry so you don't have to memorize all these things as you can see i don't memorize all these things but yeah you should have an idea that something of this sort exists okay so placeholder is equal to i'll keep enter your name [Applause] i'll put this here and then what i'll do is i'll say name here and then at the same time i'll say name is equal to name so name is the attribute that i have to set here i'm setting this name to email here i'm sending this to name and i'm saying enter your name and i'm saying enter your email then i'll say um i'm not asking for password but what i'll do is i'll ask user for their phone number maybe or maybe i'll say that write something about the service did you like the service or not or something of that sort okay so let me grab a text area from getbootstrap.com let me copy this let me paste it in ctrl s let me see how it looks it looks fine let me add some margin at the top so let me add some margin at the top let me say my 4 and i think that should be fine this is fine but again i want to add a heading as well so i'll say h2 contact us reload okay contact us and you can add some padding here as well i'll say uh p y three let's see how it looks so i'm saying class is equal to plus is equal to py3 and let me reload i think this looks fine i might as well reduce the margin from here i'm not designing a perfect website you can uh see how your users are perceiving the website you can take people's opinion and you can ask people how your website is looking but for now i think it's fine name email address maybe i'll take phone number as well i'll say tell us about our service how was our service or how may we help you okay now what i'll do is i'll copy this once again and maybe i'll ask for users phone number i'll say type is equal to tell and i'll say phone number phone phone name is equal to phone now i'll not be using the id attribute you must be thinking why i'm setting the id attribute when i'm not using it but i'm setting it because it's already set if you come to getbootstrap.com you'll see that the id is said i'm just setting it to something but you can remove it if you want but i think that's fine in the future if you want to target any element then id is going to be the thing which we'll use so let me save this now and let me come back to my form and see how it looks it looks cool except that i should have phone here instead of name so what i'll do is i'll say enter your phone number control s to save and i'll say d e s c d e s c d e s e means description also name is equal to d e s a okay i think it looks cool now okay so this looks pretty good let me make p n n small because it is a placeholder and uh lowercase looks fine okay so this is my contact us page and i'll make it capital you must be thinking why am i uh focusing on these small things but i kind of have a habit of doing this okay anyways uh we'll now reload this page and this looks fine now i'll come back to my models.py file and inside the models.py file i'll make another model i'll say contact and model start model and what i'll do is i'll say serial number is equal to models dot auto field and i'll say primary key is equal to true because i want to make it the primary key i'll say primary key is equal to true then i'll say title is equal to or not title i think we have email we have a name we have an email we have a phone and we have a desc and we have to decide how we want to uh design the database table what field is going to be a character wheel what field is going to be the date time field what field is going to be the text field so description is going to be the text field for sure so model start text field okay so you must be thinking how to decide whether we need a text field or a care field if i tell you if you are creating a website that is not going to be consumed by a lot of users i would say that it's fine you can use whatever you want but there is something called best practices if your description is going to be say 300 to 400 characters long and even longer than that in some cases you might want to use text field okay and for phone number we have a phone field but uh in django three i think they have introduced something for phone they have introduced something for slug as well but i like to use scat field because this keeps our basics very strong and i think it is the best thing so what i'll do is i'll make the max length of phone as 12 so that somebody can enter 12 characters if they want to and let me make email as 40 characters let me make name as 40 characters i think somebody with the name of 40 characters need to have a nickname and they can put their nickname so i'll save this and probably i'll have this time field as well i'll say auto ad now is equal to true this will tell me when somebody contacted me otherwise i'll keep wondering when this person contacted me was it three days ago or it was it 10 years ago was it 20 years ago anyways so i'll stop my server and i'll say python manage dot py make migrations python manage dot py migrate so make migrations well make the migration files and then migrate will actually write those tables inside the database okay once i finish this i'll start my server back and i should be able to see okay so there are some problems looks like no there is no problem i'll go back to admin and for sure you'll not see the contact here because i haven't yet registered the model so i should be going to admin dot py and i should register the model which is it is called contact so i'll say contact and i will save it i think okay so i i'll have to register it separately admin dot site dot register and what i'll do is i'll say contact contact please okay yeah so here it is i think our server has been restarted and we can see the contact here so we have zero contacts here now what i want to do is whenever somebody fills in the form uh will make a post request to this contact endpoint so what i'll do is i'll open my urls.py so whenever somebody comes to slash contact or for blog they are presented with this page okay so this is the view which is going to get executed whenever somebody comes to my blog and fills in the form so whenever he fills in the form what i'll do is i'll capture his name so i'll say request dot post okay so if request dot method equals to equals to post you must be thinking what i'm doing here you must be thinking what's going on here but i'll explain you each and everything when the request dot method is post what i want to say is i want to say if somebody is hitting this end point with a post request that is if somebody is making a post request to this end point then do this otherwise you just have to return render contact.html so i'll keep this name inside if so if requested matter is post i'll capture this name so i'll say name and then i think we have if i'm not wrong we have uh phone we have email then we have phone and the esc so email phone descr email phone dec okay i hope this makes sense i think we are making some mistake while indenting this okay this should be fine and once we have all these variables what i'll do is i'll store all of these in the database so i'll create an instance i'll say instance is equal to contact and i'll say name is equal to name email is equal to email and then i'll say phone is equal to phone and then i'll say desc is equal to desc and i'll have to import contact control s to save and then i'll have to say instance dot save and this will save it to the database once again i'll come back to my contact.html and i'll say action is equal to slash contact contact and method is equal to post method is equal to post and i think this should be fine and let's see if this works i'm not sure whether this will work or not but let me change this to name and i think everything is fine now and let me change this to phone this is for phone this label is for this phone and this label is for this tesc i think we are good so let's see if this works and if it doesn't work we'll see the error and i will fix it okay so email at gmail.com let me input some random phone number and i'll say i want to help [Applause] and i think i'm misspelling help no problems so it's saying that there is some error we are sorry so let me see what the problem is they're saying that you call this url via post but the ul doesn't end in slash and you have a principle i said can't redirect to the slash url while maintaining post data okay so it's basically telling me that whenever you have to make the post request you need to have this trailing slash so let's keep the training slash i'll ob whatever django is saying and let me reload this continue and is it telling me the same thing i think i need to restart the server once again and let me reload the page and let me fill the form once again and i'm just putting some random things random thoughts submit and it says csrf verification failed okay so i told you about csrf if i'm not wrong i told you about csrf in today's list let me tell you about csrf once again so csrf stands for cross site request forgery and cross site request forgery happens whenever you are trying to hit somebody else's website who doesn't want you to hate his website so in order to make sure that the request is coming from the same website the website supplies a csrf token so if i switch back to django html not django text and html note that this is being given to us by the extension that we have installed django html so this is the extension that we have installed if you have watched the videos you know what i mean so what i'll do is inside the form i'll say csrf token and if i keep this csrf token inside the form what happens it django engine automatically generates an input tag which has the csrf token and that csrf2 can actually verifies whether this request is coming from the same domain or not let's see if this works or not so if i go back and fill the form once again i don't know how many times i'll fill it once again but i think this will work this should work now please submit and it works let's see if we have the data saved in the database or not oh yes we do we do have the data saved inside the database so we have successfully created this contact page and it works it does work okay so let's come back to blog it looks good and i think this looks amazing but i won't like to change the number of posts on this blog page to 10 at least because it doesn't look good to me so i'll come back to views dot p y and i'll change this number of posts to say 10 or say i'll make it seven so if i reload the page next page should have only one blog post and it looks fine it's fine i think we are good we are definitely good and the previous page works as well i can read any blog i have not written it beautifully but i can write it beautifully when i go to production i'll definitely make sure that i write it beautifully now as you can see that this blog post doesn't have the main height set but whenever we are writing a blog post i think it will at least have content enough to cover this page so i should not worry about this but i might want to consider adding min height to this page you can do that if you want i'm not doing it but mountain code's blog looks amazing now i want you guys to tell me in the comment section below how does mountain coders look to you is it looking amazing i want you guys to give it some marks from 100 out of 100 how many marks would you like to give to mount encoders please reply in the comment section please reply to this question i want you guys to tell me how many marks would you like to give out of 100 to mountain coders mountain goddess looks pretty good at this point but we haven't created search i would like to have a search inside my blog because when i'll have say 2000 articles in my dreams or maybe i'll make it a reality someday to 5000 articles then users on the website would like to have a search button they would come back and search for a given article and they might recall something about my article type in some keywords from the article and they would want to see the article where back again when they typed the search terms say they type python they would like to see the python python articles on the search page but at this point we don't have anything such but we would love to have one so what we'll do is we'll come back and we'll design this search and it will be awesome for our users to have a search inside the blog they can enter any term and they can get the results corresponding to their search terms that would be amazing so we'll see how to design that but at this point i think this blog is ready for production you can take it to production you can start flaunting your coding skills to your friends to your girlfriends or whomsoever you want you can tell them that you know how to create a blog and you have a blog which is hosted online well i'll tell you how to host this online as well but at this point i hope you guys understood whatever i told you all the concepts how models work how migrations work how views work how mvd pattern works and i hope you guys have access this playlist if you haven't already done that i want you guys to access this playlist make sure to click here to bookmark it and click here to save it also if you haven't already like this video please like this video for me thank you so much guys for watching this video and i will see you next time bye
IdCs-an5QLA,in this video I'm gonna be explaining you how you can add rich text editing to your mountain coders blog what we have done so far is we have laid out the foundation of the blog we've made this homepage contact page this blog page we saw how we can enter the HTML inside our database and how we can pull it and display it as an HTML to the users of that he can easily read the content of what blog what I'm going to be doing now is I log in to my Django admin and at the same time what I'll do is let me write down admin here I'm already logged in I'll open my blogs and what I want to do at this point is I want to customize this content I want to add rich text editing to this website now if you don't know what rich text editing is had two tiny MCE website because this is going to be the rich text editor that I'm going to use so if you see the title it says the most advanced wys iwy gee you must be thinking what it is it is what you see is what you get so in in this HTML when you type something like this what you see is not what you get you see this but this is what you get but in case of rich text editors what happens behind the hood is it keeps the HTML away from the eyes of the users behind the scenes it generates HTML but it keeps it away from the eyes of the user now what do I mean by this let's have tiny MCE demo very quickly so I will go to get tiny MCE for free it's asking for signup I think we can use it without signing up if I'm not wrong you can come to tiny blog products tiny MCE so let me go to demos okay so this is a tiny MCE demo so if somehow I can embed this thing to my Django admin here it would be really great because then I'll be able to write and use all these bold italic underline and all these fonts features private is offering to my Django admin website and no-doubter to make my life easier so what I'll do is I will use this tiny MCE and we'll see how will embed to the Django admin but you must be thinking this HTML I'm talking about the entire page this entire page has not been written by us so how do we change this well we lose JavaScript to change the content of this page how do we do that initially what I'll do is I'll somehow add JavaScript to my console and test this thing but if somehow I can add a JavaScript file which executes when I open this page it would really be great so how to do that let's find out but before that I have only guys to get comfortable with rich text editor if you haven't used rich text editor ever in your life I want you to simply select this and make it bold make it italic make it say h3 and whatever features it is offering is asking me for some pictures but I don't think I want to add any picture I just wanted me add this picture let me see how it goes okay so this picture has been added and I can save if somehow I'm able to embed it to my Django admin but how do do all those things because definitely I'm not going to write HTML for every article that I produce I don't want to take the burden of writing HTML and formatting the UL li and this is not even giving me some sort of good editor and definitely I don't want to come back to visual studio code type my HTML and paste it back in here I want some rich text editing like this this will really make my life easy so how to do that let's find out so what I'll do is I'll go to examples so I'll go to basic example I'll say leave I don't want this content anymore so in order to find out how to use this thing I'll go to introduction and getting started I go to basic setup to be honest I also don't know how to use it because it's been a long time that I've used it but I will tell you how to use it while the documentation so first of all definitely will have to embed it to our website so the first step is to copy this code and copy this HTML and I think you are good now add your API key let me tell something about this so if you don't add your API key you will see this message popping up that this domain is not registered and this term it is not just a please register your domain all those messages will pop up but since this is not the front end this is not what end user will see oh we can't be in that burden but if you want to sign up and get your free API key you can do that but I am NOT doing that just for saving some time so what I'll do at this point is I'll create a new file now once again I'm creating a new file it will be created somewhere inside my project but it has nothing to do with my Django project okay I'll repeat this thing this file has nothing to do with my Django project I am just trying out tiny MCE in this file okay so let me copy this thing copy code and let me paste it somewhere here okay I'll save it with with the name tiny dot HTML I hope that name sounds good okay so what I'll do is I'll install an extension called live server if you haven't installed live server you can install live server okay so live server is an extension it's an amazing extension that I used to see my pages reload live when I change the content inside them so what I'll do is I'll click this go live button here and this is tiny Quick Start Guide okay so I see this this domain is not registered with tiny cloud please see the startup guide and get your account and whatever I'll close this thing because I don't want it I don't want to register and FaceTime but yeah if you want to use this in production you can go sign up with tiny MCE and get your key and and get rid of that message okay so let me see if this works yes this works let me Center it okay cool let me press ENTER and now let me start typing something we start typing something and change the font as well okay some typos here but who cares what I'll do is I will remove bold from here and at the same time what I'll do is I'll make this italic okay so this works this works pretty well okay so what I'll do now is I want this thing to somehow appear inside my say this Django admin now a question is why does this thing show up like this here let's understand the code that we just wrote so inside this code what we did is we added this a script that was provided by tiny MCE and then we said okay initialize my text area with ID my text area so this is a text area with this ID so what we are saying is we are saying that we want to use rich text editing inside my text area inside the text area which has the ID my text area and everything is automatically done by tiny MCE behind the scenes okay so if somehow I am able to add this script on this particular page in my Django admin and if somehow I'm able to find out the idea of this content I'll be able to add rich text editing to my Django admin so my question to you guys is is that thing clear to you the ID here is ID underscore content so I can target it with this ID but before that I need to inject this script inside the space somehow so well in order to add a script inside Django admin so in order to add the script to our back-end which is the page where we saw that content text area we'll come to our models dot py and we'll come to our admin store pure admin dot py sorry it's admin dot py and what we tell Django is that hey Django could you please add this JavaScript file to my say Django admin page which contains this model which is this particular page with blog model how do we do that is a good question and let's find out how to do that so I'll close this thing okay so in order to add some custom JavaScript or CSS to the speech what I'll do is I'll come back to my visual studio code and I'll add some static JavaScript to static folder so let me create a folder inside the static and inside this J's what I'll do is I'll add C blog dot J's and at the same time what I'll do is I'll add another folder got CSS if at all I want to add some CSS to my Django blog or rather this this particular page which contains the change blog text and all these text areas I can come back to this page and I can add the CSS just like I'm adding this J's so I'll tell you how to add CSS and at the same time I'll also tell you how to add JavaScript so what I'll do is I'll say console dot log this is blog tortillas so if we see this executed inside the console that means that we are able to successfully add this blog dot GS file to the model in order to add this blog dot J's file on this particular page what I'll do is I'll come back to my admin dot py and what I'll do is I'll say class so let me write class I'll say blog admin and what I'll do is I'll inherit it from admin dot model admin and then what I'll do is I'll say class and again I'll say media now this media is an inner class inside this media I can declare what sort of files do I need to add to my models I'll say add CSS files I can say at this particular J's file or whatever I want I can do using this media inner class now how do I at CSS files so all you have to do is you have to say CSS is equal to you have to initialize this stationary and you have to say all and at the same time what do you have to do is you have to just add the file name which is inside the CSS folder so what I'm doing is I'm giving the path inside this static folder to this CSS file okay so I'll say main dot CSS let me add this main dot CSS file so main dot CSS and at the same time what I'll do is and let me say h1 color red I'm using this funky color so that I can see that the CSS has been added to my page or not now what I'll do is I'll say GS is equal to and I'll give the name of the JavaScript while which I want to add so what I'll do is I'll say J a slash blog dot J's and let me reload this page and check the console so there are two messages in the console but I think this page has not yet been added to to this blog admin alright so there are a few things I want to fix here firstly I want to move this thing right after I create this class and I'll also have to register blog admin and now what I'll do is I'll also add a comma here note that the commas are necessary because this tuple contains only one item and when a Python couple contains only one item what you'll have to do is you'll have to add a comma it is necessary okay so let's restart the server once again and let's see what we have let's see if we see this message inside this home console or not so we don't have this message let's see if we have this static file I'll say 127.0.0.1 slash static slash blog dot J's okay so I think our static URL is not yet configured okay so I'll have to say J slash blog gorgeous ok so there's some problem with the static URL so let's go to mount encoder settings dot P Y and at the same time what we'll do is we'll see if we have these static files dirs I think it's called static files dirs that we'll have to set okay so it was there static files dirs oh it's called maduk files TI ASL copied from here and let me copy it from the django documentation so these are the things that you not remember always you'll have to come back to documentation and you'll have to copy pasted from here so do not hesitate from copy pasting all these things let me search it okay it's here let me find about it let me click this and see where I land okay so here it is so this is the list of all the directories which will contain your static files okay so we'll have to add it here let me add it here and I'll add just one file folder sorry and say static is going to be the folder where I'll have all my static files and let me see if this works now oh yes it works and let me see if this works now so I'll have to restart my triangle and let me see if it works it doesn't work there's something wrong I think I'm not able to add this blog tortillas okay so let me see what went wrong here I have not saved this admin dot py first of all if I reload this okay so we have this this is the blog dot GS and our h1 has also been changed to red color so quite a struggle there but again we are able to successfully add this javascript file to a Django model so all we did was we created this blog admin class and then we created a media inner class and then we added the CSS dictionary and J's tupple and you must be wondering where I got all this from so I just recall it out of my head because I have been coding in Django since a very long time but if you had to internet and you searched customizing the Django admin file let's so I had to internet and say Django model admin add CSS and J's and let me see if I am directly to this page or not I think I have already visited this page once and let me jump to model admin options and let me see if I can get that GSS okay so here it is we have this model admin asset definitions and it tells me that I can add this name of the model in an admin and then the in a class called media and and CSS inches but for now I think we are good we don't have to navigate to the documentation and spend time there what I'll do now is I'll add some JavaScript to this block gorgeous so that we can see a tiny MCE inside her Django gob model okay so what I'll do at this point is I'll change my blog dot GS so that I'm targeting my tiny MCE to work on this content text area so what I'll do is I'll come back to my visual studio code and let me had to blog dot GS so what I want to do here is I'll add the tiny MCE script first and then what I'll do is I'll say I want to add tiny MCE to this content text area and not to any other tiny temps your hashtag text area or whatever the default thing tiny MC provides is also what I'll do is I'll change this color back to normal so I'll add to my CSS file I created mean dot CSS and in future if I have to change my Django I had been interface I can come back to the CSS and make changes here so I hope you guys understood how tiny MCE walk in the next video we'll come back and we'll see how to integrate tiny MCE to this content so I hope you enjoyed this video and at the same time if you haven't already accessed this playlist I want you guys to do that this is the playlist where I'm adding the videos consistently and I'm adding all the videos corresponding to this Django blog to this playlist so I want you guys to access this playlist as soon as possible also if possible please give me a like and share this playlist with your friends that mean a lot to me thank you so much guys for watching this video and I'll see you next time

_MF8L7ZxwRE,"welcome to this complete C language course with handwritten notes C is known as the mother of all programming languages in fact a lot of compilers and jvms are written in C whenever it comes to programming C language is considered as the best to learn for beginners my name is Harry and I will be your instructor throughout this course we'll start from the basics of C in fact from the basics of programming and then we'll raise the bar like anything we learn about pointers we learn about functions we learn about Dynamics memory allocation which is one of the most confused topics when it comes to C the only prerequisite of this course is your time I just want you to come here devote some of your time to this course and definitely you will learn and master see like anything if you want to support this initiative make sure you hit the like button and also give me a comment saying this C language course is helpful that would mean a lot to me I have divided this course into different chapters each chapter has its own practice set which makes makes it easy for you to practice about the topic discussed in that chapter to make learning fun and simple I have also included some projects for you and one of the projects we are going to do in this course is a very interesting game and you'll definitely enjoy it when I started learning C I was really very confused with the syntax in fact the concept of pointer was something I was not able to wrap around my head but there were some of the tips and tricks that I used and some of the very amazing analogies which helped me learn C in a very very beautiful way this chapter consists of handwritten notes which are made by me I have used different colors in the notes I have written each and every chapter in The Practice set of the note to make things easier for you not only that I have also included a cheat sheet with this course so that after you are done with the course you have the boilerplate syntax and all the syntax that you want to use in your C programs is single click away I'll give you a link to the online and the PDF cheat sheet along with the cheat sheet and notes I have also timestamped this video so that you can easily navigate to the different chapters and you can easily learn C programming language the projects that we are going to do in this course can be added to your GitHub profile to enhance your portfolio do not forget to add them to your GitHub profile so enough of talks now let's get started so I am inside my computer screen let me be very honest with you guys this course is very very beautifully structured I have created notes for all the chapters and we have around 11 chapters in two projects and this is going to be fun so let's open chapter number zero where I'm going to give you introduction on what exactly C programming is and what exactly programming in general is because if this is your first language and you have not seen programming or maybe you haven't written any program in the past this course is going to be the starting point so what is programming computer programming is a medium for us to communicate with computers so just like me and you are communicating we are communicating with the help of a language which is English I'm using English language to express my feelings to you I'm using some English words which you can understand and take actions on for example if I say please come here you can come here if I say please go to the market you will go to the market and all those things so we have a computer and computer can be a desktop computer a laptop computer and I even call this phone as a computer this is also a mini computer so we can give instructions to the computer it can be of any form it can be a chip of this size or a phone of this size or a laptop of this size IR respective of what your computer is you need a medium to talk to the hardware and that Medium is programming so programming can be seen as a medium for us to communicate with computers just like we use Hindi or English to communicate with each other programming is a way for us to deliver instructions to the computer you might use Spanish you might use Dutch you might use some other language irrespective of what language you are using you are simply using it as a medium to communicate with the other person just like that we use C programming language to communicate with our computers so what is c c is a programming language it is one of the oldest programming languages it is called mother of all programming languages for a reason a lot of jvms and compilers are written in C operating systems are written in C A lot of lowlevel stuff is written in C so C is one of the most important programming languages and this is said to be a programming language which all the computer Enthusiast and computer software Engineers must learn so C is one of the oldest and finest programming languages he was developed by Dennis Richie at AT&T's Bell Laboratories in 1972 you don't have to remember this I remember this just because I've seen or read this statement a lot of times but you don't have to remember this but remember the name of Dennis Richie he indeed brought a revolution to the world of programming now let us talk about about the uses of C what exactly are the uses of C where would you want to use C programming language so C language is used to program a wide variety of systems some of the use cases are major operating systems Linux and there are a lot of other Linux distributions which are written in C so we use C to write an operating system which controls all the hardware of our machine so C is a very important language now let's talk about driver program C is also used to write driver program s let us say I have a device it's a camera it can be a printer it can be uh it can be a chip I can write device driver software using C programming language now C programming language is also used to program embedded systems where programs need to run faster and limited memory see there are a lot of programming languages in the market we have python we have Java we have JavaScript all these programming languages are good for one task or the other C is good and C is is famous to run faster in limited memory and wherever we have limited memory wherever we have embedded systems a microwave a very small chip something that needs to run in milliseconds is written in C now C is something that is very very close to the hardware and it is one of the most loved Language by those people who want to have a lot of controls in hand now C is also used to develop games an area where latency is very very important if you have played pubg or GTA y City GTA San Andreas GTA 5 cyber Punk we all play games right we all play one or the other game in our phones sometimes the latency is really very important especially in the case when we have limited Hardware in memory when we have limited Hardware limited amount of memory latency is really very important can you imagine you are pushing a button and that button is kicking somebody in your game and that kicks actually takes place seconds after you press the button you'll not play that game you'll not enjoy that game so latency is really very important in such games and C language is used to develop such games it really reduces the latency and C is an amazing language so we will start writing our first program in the next chapter we'll see the building blocks of a c program we'll see how C program is structured and how it looks and why we need to follow some of the best practices we'll see all those things in the next chapter let's move on to chapter one now let's start start with the first chapter and let's open this PDF I have written this PDF with a lot of hard work so please listen to whatever I'm telling you in this video very very carefully and definitely you will become a champion of C within no time uh let's now install a software called vs code you must be wondering what vs code is if you are a beginner but just follow along and see how I'm downloading and installing Visual Studio code you just have to download it I'm downloading it for Windows because I'm using Windows if you're using Mac Linux or some other operating system it should be available for your operating system it's very famous and it is really very good and fast so I'll simply install this vs code by clicking on this it is going to take 10 more seconds in my machine Visual Studio code has been installed so I'll run it I'll simply click next but I'll not be able to click next until I read this license agreement I've read the license agreement I'll click on accept the license agreement I'll go to next and make sure that these check boxes are checked this is very important and I'll tell you why later but make sure that all all these checkboxes are checked you might want to create a desktop icon if you want to create you can check it otherwise not but these other checkboxes must be checked I'll tell you why after some time let's click on next let's click on install and this is going to install Visual Studio code on my machine so I'll wait for it to install and in the meantime what I'll do is I'll say download MW now what is this MW it's a compiler that we are going to use and this is something that will help us Runner C programs I'll tell you how and why later but let's download it and let's set up MW in our machine so all you have to do is simply click on this download button and your download will start shortly I'm waiting for it to download this is simply gnu for Windows it's GCC which is used to compile C programs you can see your Chrome downloads by clicking here and clicking on downloads and after you do that you will see that MW get setup.exe this has been downloaded so I'll run it I'll simp simply click on install uh this is the directory where I want my MW to get installed if you don't want to get it installed here you can install it in program files or something but I'll not touch it I'll simply go to continue and this is downloading the installation manager this takes some time let me be very honest with you I'm using quite fast internet connection still it takes some time so give it its time you can go grab a cup of coffee or maybe you can go for lunch or dinner and come back and this will be downloaded but yeah it is downloading quite fast f it depends upon the source for servers to be very honest sometimes it's fast sometimes it's slow but again irrespective of whatever the case is you can grab a cup of coffee so I'll give it its time and in the meantime I'll look into Visual Studio code but I'll not launch Visual Studio code from here and I'll tell you why I'll simply uncheck this check box and I'll click on finish and what I'll do is I'll come back to this folder where I've created all the notes for you I'll come back to this chapter one folder and what I'll do is I'll right click and and I'll see this option open with code in a very very rare case if you do not see this options after following the steps that I mentioned you can restart your computer but in most of the cases you should and you will definitely see this option open with code simply click on open with code and once you do that this folder will be opened in Visual Studio code now what does this mean when I say that this folder will be opened in Visual Studio code this simply means that I have this Visual Studio code source code editor and all the files that I'll create here will reflect here and vice versa so if I create a new folder here I'll see it here and if I create a new folder by clicking here let me call it new folder 2 I'll see it here as well so I can look into all the files delete read write all the files from here itself so this is one of the biggest advantages of Visual Studio code I simply selected it and pressed delete on my keyboard and this actually deleted all those folders that I didn't need it now what I do is I'll simply click on this plus icon and I'll say 01 uncore basic. C and this will actually create a file now what is this do c and what does this program name mean let me tell you so when I say 01 basic. C it actually creates a C file a c source code file just like we save our PDFs with an extension of PDF just like we save our text files with an extension of txt just like we save our movie files with an extension of MP4 we save our C source code files using C now what I'll do is I'll come back to visual studio code and this will look very very haunting to you if you are opening it for the first time you might get confused what these buttons are about you might get confused what the setting is about and let me tell you how this Visual Studio code has been customized for my case now you will see some other color in your Visual Studio code and that might bother some of the students so let me tell you that you can actually install a jellyfish theme extension simply type jellyfish themes after clicking on this extensions button so I'll say jellyfish theme or other themes if I'm not wrong uh I think it's theme jellyfish theme and I already have jellyfish theme installed um maybe I'm not spelling it correctly let me find it out jellyfish jellyfish theme yeah so it's jellyfish theme it's said so simply search for this jellyfish theme install and you should also see this color theme another thing that I'm using is cc++ intellisense so you can click on install you will see this install button for my case it has already been installed so I'm not going to reinstall it you can click on this install button and this will be installed so uh for the time being we'll use these two extensions I have some other extensions too which I have uh enabled for other projects but I'll disable them immediately so let me disable all these uh Community material theme so I usually work with a lot of extensions with a lot of other languages so what I'll do is I'll simply uh disable all these extensions so I have disabled GitHub markdown so let me disable all these things which we do not need here and which might confuse you you don't have to install and disable all these extensions let me tell you I'm disabling it because I don't want them to disturb me while I'm coding in C with you so let me reload my vs code I'll simply click on reload U and that should do now what I'll do is I'll simply create a boiler plate C code and for that what I'll do is I'll open uh my C cheat sheet and I'll give you the link of my C cheat sheet from the description uh so let me open the C language cheat sheet I'll copy this code I'll paste this code I'll save and what I'll do is I'll simply say print F and I'll say hello word now you must be thinking what have I written in here I haven't explained anything here and I have written all these things without even explaining this is unfair but again you just have to type this without understanding yes without understanding what it means because we are going to look and desect into all these things in the rest of this video so do not worry and type this as is you can copy the boiler plate from here I'll give you the link of the street sheet as well and also what I'll do is I'll see if this has been completed so I'll click on on continue and all you need to do is you need to click on this minw 32 GCC g++ and I'll mark this for installation just click and click on Mark for installation and this is a C++ compiler and C++ compiler as well as a c compiler because we have GCC g++ so just install it I'll go for installation and I'll say apply changes and I'll say apply and this will actually download this and install it it sometimes gets very very annoying when the server is slow and it takes a lot of time so let me warn you beforehand do not cancel it it sometimes takes a very long amount of time and yes it is annoying but again it's worth it just go for a cup of coffee or go for lunch or dinner and you'll definitely love it when you come back and see everything you know getting installed and uh set up for you so I'll also do the same let me go and grab a glass of water and I'll come back after I have all this installed and set up on my machine so finally this has been completed and let me tell you guys this took a lot of time lot of time and my computer is fast and internet is fast so let me close this dialogue box and we have installed MW GCC g++ now see how we can use it so what I'll do is I'll go to my local DC and I'll go to the folder where this m GW has been installed I'll go to bin and I'll simply copy this path now what I'll do is I'll type en EnV and I'll be able to edit my system environment variables and and I'll click on environment variables then I'll click on path then I'll edit the path I'll add A New Path I'll paste this path and I'll click okay and then I'll simply click okay once again and once again and that will actually add GCC uh gc. exe this thing to path so basically what I want to do is I want to use this GCC exe to compile my C programs and because of that what I've done is I've added this folder this particular folder to path what happens when you add add a location to path basically you will be able to use all the txe executables without having to navigate to this path so let me show you I'll close this and what I'll do is I'll open my windows poell and I'll simply say GCC now the moment I enter you can see that no input files message has been provided to me it is basically telling me that you have not given me any source file to compile so let's come to visual studio code and see how we can compile our source files so so I'll close this terminal and you can open the terminal by clicking here terminal new terminal this actually opens a new terminal and you can say GCC 01 basic. C so once you type this you are basically saying compile this program which is written inside this source file 01 basic. C so you want to compile this file to a file which can be executed by this machine this machine is a Windows machine so it will compile it to aexe file let's see the moment I press enter you'll see an a.exe file created here now I can run this a.exe file I'll simply say a and press tab this actually autocompletes the moment you say a so anything that starts with a will get autocom completed so I'll simply say a and then I'll press tab or I can even type this particular thing dot back/ a.exe the moment I press enter I'm seeing this hello word so this program basically prints hello word I can even say hello Harry let me show you and back sln is nothing but a new line character so it actually prints a new line character because of which we are seeing this PSD this thing here instead of here so if I if I skip this back sln what what will happen is let me compile it once again and then once again I'll say/ a.exe the moment I say hello Harry this will actually not print a new line so let me show you a practical example of what this back slash n is doing so the moment I run this program once again you'll see that hello Harry a new line and then hello Harry but if I skip this back sln and once again I I'll compile this and I'll run this you'll see that there is no new line after Harry so what I'm doing is I'm using my arrow keys to compile my program once again and execute my program once again so you'll have to compile every time you make a change to your program this is something that you need to remember I hope that I'm clear I hope that all these things are clear in fact this is not clear so far but I'll make it clear to you very very very soon so let's come back to our PDF cheat sheet uh or rather PDF notes not cheat sheet let me close or I'll simply keep this cheat sheet open as well I'll close other tabs and let's talk about variables constants and keywords so for now just forget about how all this works and let's focus on the concept of variables constants and keywords what are these three things and why do we need these three things so let's talk about a variable it's a container which stores a value so if you have a kitchen and you cook some food in your kitchen there is a high chance that you'll have some containers which will contain some rice maybe some Dal maybe some um what do you call it um some tea leaves maybe you'll have some vinegar in some container you'll have some water in some container you'll definitely have some soya sauce or tomato sauce all those things in a container in a very similar way just like a container is used to store a particular thing we use small container for Dal and for rice and we use a big container to store say floor or we use bottles to store vinegar and also we use uh one or two liter bottles to store water okay so different containers for different things in a very similar way C programming language has a concept of container and container is nothing but a variable it is called variable in C programming language in fact in any programming language it is called a variable and it simply stores a value so in kitchen we have container storing rice T sugar Etc similar to that variables and C stores value of a constant for example a is equal to 3 now a contains a constant which is three B is equal to 4.7 B is aign 4.7 7 C is equal to a c is assigned a character which is a we'll talk about what characters are what floating Point numbers are and what integers are but for now we need to get a hang of how these things are working so let's talk about few rules for naming variables in C can I name my variable as 001 harry2 no I cannot do that and we'll see why we cannot do that so first character must be an alphabet or an underscore so you can use an alphabet or an underscore so let's try so I'll say intore a and semicolon and I'll say seven now just forget about what this int is what this equal to is how these things are working just focus on the concept of variable see I'm not getting any error I'm not seeing any error from my vs code when I type underscore a but the moment I say zore a and I save it you'll see that a red line is actually beneath this zero which which is basically telling me that hey you cannot name this variable starting with zero so I'm actually violating this particular rule because of which I'm seeing that error now commas and blanks are not allowed in variable names so even if I have it as underscore a and let me save it so even if I have an underscore a and I give a space and say Harry no this is not allowed the moment I save it this will give me an error but if I join it with an underscore and save it this is actually allowed because spaces are not allowed commas are also not allowed so if I put a comma and save it this is actually not allowed as well and this will also create problems a variable with this name will not be created okay so this is something that you need to know and let's move on to the next rule for naming variables in C no special symbol other than underscore is allowed so let me show this to you let me put a dollar here and save it no this is is not allowed the moment you try to compile this file you'll not get the desired output now no special symbol other than an underscore is allowed also variable names are case sensitive which means that if I have a variable called Harry and I have another variable which is capital H Harry these both are different variables and will uh store all these numbers differently in different separate containers these are not exactly the same thing so this is allowed so you can say in small Harry and in capital L and this will not create any problems in your program now we must create meaningful variable names in our programs this enhances readability of our programs and actually makes it easy for other programmers to read our code so this is something that you need to follow always use meaningful variable names if you want to create a variable for storing say value of a URL simply call it URL or value of URL do not call it ABCD or something else or your neighbors or your crush's name not do that just type the thing that it is for example if I want to create a variable for storing the amount of coffee that I'm taking per day I should actually name it amount of coffee cups of coffee or something like that I should not call it Puja Reena Tina or Monica for that matter so let's talk about constants for now an entity whose value doesn't change is called as a constant what is a constant it doesn't change three it doesn't change four is four it will never change four will never ever become five or 10 for that matter so four is a constant three is a constant something which is not going to change is a constant but if I say a is equal to 3 I can always say a is equal to 4 and I can actually put four inside that container which was previously holding three so I can change this container to hold four now so this is a variable we can change its value its value is three at this point but later it can become four also it can become 14 some time in the future so you never know but a constant is not going to change four is not going to change four is going to be four in this lifetime and even when we have kids of our kids they will also call it four and it's going to carry the same value which is four so four fingers are going to be this now 40 years ago and even 2,000 years later it is going to be four so it's not going to change change ever so this entity is called constant variable is an entity whose value can be changed now doesn't mean that it will always change but it can be changed so a equal to 3 can be changed B is equal to 4.7 can always hold 5.8 in the future so it can change this is something that we need to hold in our mind before we start with this chapter before we start writing programs and see I want you to ensure that you have this code Runner extension if you don't have this extension simply type code Runner and simply install it you'll see an install button here just like I'm seeing for Chinese and for editor config you simply have to click on that install button and your code Runner will be installed this will give you this run button here so whenever you are in a c program you'll see this run button so make sure that you get this run Button as soon as possible it will help you execute and run your C programs comfortably now we'll move ahead and talk about the types of constant we have various types of constants primarily there are three types of constants we have an integer constant we have a real constant also we have a character constant so we are going to see how we can write these three types of constants in C also we are going to see few examples of us assigning these constants to a variable so what I'll do is I'll open vs code you can see that I already have this program written I'll do one simple thing I'll say 02 underscore I'll simply say constants do c and the moment I say constant. C and um let me also copy the boilerplate code I'll Simply Save this uh what I can do is I can say int Harry is equal to 7 also I can say car Harry 2 is equal to C notice that I am using single codes for a character you have to make sure that whenever you are assigning some variable to a character you need to use single codes now this might sound very very confusing to some beginners but let me tell you something as we move ahead in this course you are going to find all these things very simple and easy so please bear with me for sometimes and definitely you are going to grasp all these uh Concepts very very easily similarly we use a float keyword now these keywords might sound very very strange to you if you are a programming beginner or C beginner for that matter but let me simply show you how we can assign some uh values different types of constants to a variable so I wrote 5.23 I could have written 5.23 I just removed minus sign uh and similarly I can use minus 7 when I'm assigning an integer to to this Harry variable now let's come back to the notes and let's build some understanding around this and then what we'll do is we'll come back to vs code and write some sensible programs so primarily there are three types of constants we already saw that integer constant real constant and character constant so this is very very important these three types of constants are something that you really need to remember and let's now talk about keywords What are keywords so whenever we are writing a program there is some part of the program that we have written it's coming from our mind it's coming from our head and there is some part of the program which is not coming from our head it is something that has already been reserved by the C programming language Community somebody who built this programming language reserved these keywords or rather declared these keywords as reserved so these are reserved words whose meaning is already known to the compiler so meaning of all these keywords is already known to the compiler now there are 32 keywords available in C uh let's see what those 32 keywords are but before we see these 32 keywords let me tell you you don't have to remember these keywords a lot of people try to remember these keywords and and that doesn't sound good you don't have to do this please do not try to remember these keywords this is something that we should avoid you will eventually start remembering all these keywords when once you uh start writing some meaningful programs and once you start building few projects in C language these keywords or other some of these keywords will definitely sit in your head now Auto double instruct break long else I have joted all these uh keywords down just for your understanding because I wanted you guys to have a comprehensive list of all these keywords at your disposal so let's write a first C program uh we have already written a first C program but I want you to write this program as your first C program type each and everything do not use any shortcuts or copy paste simply type this out Simply type this hash include stdio.h now uh simply say in Main and simply type it out do not think about what hash include is what stdi .h is do not think about what int main is what uh print f is what return zero is just type it out and execute in in your um vs code or if you're using some other IDE or source code editor uh which I do not recommend if you are a beginner please follow along if you are a beginner but if you are an advanced user just trying to hone your C skills you can simply come to this tutorial and use the IDE or source code editor of your choice so so once you start typing this program out uh let me write the first program as well so I'll say 03 uncore first. C uh so I've typed this program out and also what I'll do is I'll simply copy this uh I I told you that you have to type but I'm copying I'm copying because I don't want to waste your time to be honest but I want you guys to type it out because when you type it out when you type something out you actually remember things uh but if you copy paste and you know start running or simply read from the nodes you might not remember it that well so let me see if it is the exact same program which I've written uh hello I'm learning C with Harry let me write it down hello I am learning see with Harry and um back sln is something that you might want to write but uh let's write return zero and let's run this program also I'll save this program so what I'll do is simply run this program and once I run this program you can see Hello I learning see with Harry has been printed on the screen now let's talk about what this structure means what is this basic structure of a c program how all this works together this is really very important so let's talk about this let's talk about the basic structure of a c program so all C programs have to follow a basic structure a c program starts with a main function you can see that we we have a main function and execute instructions present inside it so main is a function now you might think what what is this terminology about what is this function I've never heard of a function but bear with me function is something uh you can you can look at function as an entity enclosed in this curly braces name of this function is main int is something that it returns but we'll come back to functions in the later chapter let's focus on uh this particular function and let's let's think of function as uh let us say a box containing instructions let let's C function in a very very U layman terms of uh box containing structure instructions so printf hello I am learning C with Harry is an instruction return zero is an instruction but for now what we will do is we'll ignore this return zero instruction definitely it's doing something but let's ignore this part of the program in mean and return zero let's look at this piece of the program as something that we will have to write to execute the program and believe me we'll come back to this and we are going to understand all these things in a real great detail also this is a header file and we are going to talk about it as well so let's ignore line number three and four and line number six and 7even and whatever is between this and this which is a single line will be executed by the program let's look at this and let's also remember that we cannot change the name of this function it has to be main because main is the function which gets executed whenever your program runs okay so I hope I explain this program to you pretty well let's move ahead and let's see each instruction is terminated with the semicolon there are some rules which are applicable to all C programs so we going to see all these rules now so the rule number one is every program's execution starts from the main function so whenever we are executing a program the execution starts from the main function all these statements are terminated with the semicolon so this is instruction it is terminated with the semicolon this is an instruction it is terminated with the semicolon this is actually part of this function so this is not terminated with a semicolon also this is a part of the function this is function definition so this is not terminated by a semicolon we are going to come back to functions and function definitions uh so please bear with me until that time Now instructions are case sensitive if you type something in capital P if I say Capital BR this is is going to show me some issues because capital printf is not a function to print it's small printf so it is case sensitive do not change the case of U the function names or the keywords or um the function names for that matter uh I hope you are enjoying and understanding what I'm trying to tell you instructions are executed in the same order in which they are written so if I have written hello I'm learning C with Harry first and let us say I write another hello after that this is going to print first and this is going to follow the first print statement let me show you so what I'll do is I'll save this program and run this you can see hello I'm running C with Harry and hello has been printed but if I shift this line above this line then hello will be printed first and then hello I am learning C with Harry will be printed let me show you so I accidentally selected it and run it you don't have to select it and run it so I'll click somewhere and once again I'll try to run it and you can see hello hello I'm learning C with Harry has been printed on the screen so never select a part of program and run it if you don't know what you are doing because whenever you select a part of program and try to execute it what happens is it is copied to a file called temp Cod Runner file. C and you are going to be in trouble okay so always make sure that whenever you are running your programs you're not selecting a part of it okay so coming back to our notes uh we have understood what the basics structure of C program looks like you might also have some ambiguity in your mind you must be thinking what is this mean what is this end what is this curly bracket but I want you to please sit back relax and just listen to me for some time and as we move ahead in this course you are going to clear a lot of your Concepts I promise you so let's Now understand the concept of comments what exactly is comment so comments are something that is used to clarify something about the program in plain and simple language let us say me and you are working on a c program what if I want to tell you that please do not uh touch this function I'm going to write it if I write something like this if if I say that um I want to write code to read the user uh mic if I if I write it in plain text what is going to happen if I run this program I'm going to see some errors you can see that c language compiler is telling me that this is is not a valid C code please do not write it there another option uh for me can be creating another text file with the same name as that of program and putting all these comments with line numbers but that will be really very tedious so C provides the mechanism of comments you can add comments to your C program all you have to do is simply use this double forward slashes this is a single line comment in C and what it tells your C compiler is that do not not execute this line as an instruction completely ignore this line This is written for me so I can also add some other details to my program using comments there is another format of comment which is multi-line comment whatever you write between these two is a multi-line comment so if I say author Harry Place India I can I can write all these U comments inside my um this forward slashstar and star forward slash and this is going to really make my life a lot lot easy because I don't have to create a separate text file also it'll be very easy and straightforward for me to U Mark few places in the program with some text so this is all what comments do coming back to the notes comments are used to clarify something about the program in plain language it can also be a specific place in the program a specific line number so it is a way for us to add notes to a program um there are two types of comments in see uh single line comment is one multi-line comment is another one single line comment is written like this this is the comment forward SL forward SL this is a comment so this is a comment for slash star this is a multi-line comment star forward slash this is a multi-line comment so you can actually press enter and uh write as many new lines as you want but here you cannot add new lines because the moment you add new line this particular line is treated as a separate instruction and this might uh cause some errors in the program we don't want that so I'll press contrl Z I'll Simply Save and we can see that a program looks clean if I run this program you can see hello hello I'm learning C with Harry has been printed coming back to the notes comments in C program are not executed and are ignored so comments are ignored by the compiler compiler will not execute your comments as instruction even if it is some code for example if I comment this particular line out I can use a keyboard shortcut which is control for slash to write single line comments so the moment I comment this particular line out this print of hello will not be executed so the moment I run this you can see hello I am learning C with Harry has been printed so this is how this particular program works and hello I am learning C with Harry has been printed uh also what I want to do is if if I comment this line as well will something happen no nothing happens a program has no instructions so it simply executes and exits because there are no instructions to execute inside the main function but ideally we'll not have this kind of scenario we'll have some instructions that we want to execute and you can see that the moment I uncommanded using the same shortcut of control forward slash you can see that I am now able to see Hello and hello I'm learning see with Harry printed on the console so I hope you understood all these things I hope this was easy for you now we are going to learn about I would say the most important Concept in C programming language which is a concept of compilation and execution and do not get haunted with this concept because I'm going to explain you in a very simple way and you don't have to understand how compiler works if you are a programming beginner yes if you are in the field of compilers if you are a compiler expert maybe you you might want to look into those topics but for the sake of this tutorial for the sake of learning C programming language I do not recommend looking into ins and outs of working of a compiler you should know how to use a compiler just like you know how to use your uh cell phone you know how to use your laptop but there's a high chance that you do not know what is happening inside the chips of your laptop in a very similar way we are going to use the compiler and maybe in the future if you are you know choosing that field as your major you might want to look into what a compiler is but for the sake of this tutorial let's understand how compiler works so first. C in vs code is a file that I created it is no different than some file that we create using notepad or using Microsoft Word or some other text file for that matter uh Microsoft Word is not a PL and simple text file it uh might be a binary because it is uh created using word so what basically happens is that we have this source code file we have some characters written inside this file just like we have characters in the notepad so if I show you this file it looks something like this now this file will be taken as input by the C compiler and what C compiler which is GCC what it will do is it will convert it to a code which is understood by my operating system which is understood by the machine I am on in this case Windows machine so for the windows operating system this particular source code will be compiled and for Windows it is compiled to a first. exe file so dotexe is the file extension to which it is compiled in Windows so let me show you this thing uh I'll come back to my vs code I'll open the terminal I'll say GCC I'll say 03 obviously after a space I'll say 03 uncore first. C and the moment I press enter I'll get a a .exe so a.exe is the file which is generated but in case I want to get a file with a desired output name I'll say harry. exe so a harry. exe will be created now if I type harry. exe uh oops I need to type something like this it's telling me that you need to type this instead of harry. DXE so I'll obey the instructions and the moment I do this and press enter you can see that this program is being executed so how is it working let me explain it to you once again so first. TC is a universal code file which can be circulated around to any operating system but once you are into an operating system what is an operating system Linux is an operating system Mac is an example of operating system Windows is an example of operating system and there can be a number of operating systems but at this point what we are worried about is we need a compiler for our operating system I have installed a c compiler for Windows and and the moment I use that compiler using GCC 03 first. C minus o harry. EXC what I'm telling this compiler is I'm saying hey compiler hey C compiler I have this first. C file please take this file as an input and spit out a file which is compatible with my operating system so first. texe is generated here in this case since I've written harry. DXE harry. DXE is generated but let me do one thing let me make it first. exe so what happens is first. exe this file will be generated after compilation of this source code file now I cannot distribute or rather take this file to some other operating system this is a binary for window this is an exe file for window this will only work in Windows I cannot take it to Linux and I cannot take it to Mac and run directly directly it's not possible to run maybe you can use some virtual machine there are a number of ways to run it in Mac but again we are talking about straightforward direct running from the terminal you cannot do that you cannot take an exe file and run it in Mac or in Linux directly you will have to use this source code file and once again compile the source code file for your operating system and then only you'll be able to use that binary I hope I'm clear I hope I made these things easy for you so coming back to the notes a compiler is a computer program what is a compiler now compiler is also a computer program uh and it might sound strange to you if compiler is a computer program who compiled the compiler please do not think all these things just focus on how this compiler is working this is a computer program which is GCC exe I've shown you we have seen this GCC exe file what it is doing is it is taking first. c as the input and it is fitting out an exe file for my operating system this exe file is support by my operating system it converts a c program into machine language so that it can be easily understood by the computer and that machine language is not uniform across operating systems it is specific for a Windows operating system for a Mac machine or for a Linux machine for that matter but you will have to compile it for your machine and the source code file can be distributed across operating systems you go to some other operating system take the source code file compile it for your operating system and you are good to go a c program is written in plain text the plain text is combination of instructions in a particular sequence just like we saw here this is an instruction this is an instruction and this program is a set of instructions we have already seen that now the compiler performs some basic checks and finally converts the program into an executable so this is a program this program will be converted to an executable which is an exe file by my C compiler so this C compiler will take the task of converting this particular uh piece of text I would say to a piece of binary which is executable or understood by the machine I hope that is clear now let's talk about some Library functions now what are Library functions in C remember we are using this print F but we never defined it where is this printf coming from how are we able to use this print F and how does this work so let's talk about this printf is nothing but a library function so C Lang has a lot of valuable Library functions which is used to carry out certain tasks for instance printf function is used to print values on the screen you can print values using print F just like we are doing this and percentage D for integers percentage F is For Real values and percentage SE for characters we'll look into these once again but if we want to print a number I'll say this is an integer and I'll simply say percentage f uh sorry percentage D percentage D is for integers and I I'll simply say a I can say in is equal to three it's an integer int is equal to 3 and this particular thing will print nothing but this is an integer three so you can see this is an integer three has been printed so this is how this um this is an integer three is printed on the screen I hope you got the point I hope you understood how all these things are working and and I hope you also understood how I'm using this particular thing to print this particular integer but what if you want to print a double can I say int B is equal to 3 point uh sorry float I want to print a float so I'll say float B is equal to 3.1 can I print B let's see what happens when I try to print B this garbage value is being printed why is it so this is happening because if I want to print a floating Point number which is a number with a decimal I need to use percentage F so now if I run this program you can see 3.1 is being printed and this will work for character as well so I'll have to say car c is equal to and whenever we talk about characters we need a single code so single code and inside single codes will be a character which will be printed on the screen so what what will I do I'll say this is a character I'll say C and this is a floating point Point number and um I'll have to use percentage C for character if I run this you'll see this is a character C this is a floating Point number 3.1 and let me write this for a as well this is an integer and I'll save this is a floating Point number and let me also add a percentage n sorry not percentage n back sln I'm sorry about that back sln is is the new line character it simply adds a new line at the end of your print statement and I'll have to do the same thing here as well so after every line I'm writing a new line character just to ensure that whatever I'm writing contains a new line at the end of it so if I try to run this you'll see hello hello I'm learning C with Harry this is an integer why is it showing me zero okay I need to use percentage D for integers uh let me run it once again yeah this is an integer three this is a floating Point number 3.1 this is a character C and I hope you got the point I hope you understood everything that I taught you so far okay let's now talk about the types of variables how many types of variables do we have we have integer variables just like we saw recently I created in equal to 3 and this was an integer okay so we can store numbers from minus infinity to Infinity uh inside this uh variable a and it will not contain a decimal like this if we want a decimal number we use floats so we say float B is equal to 3.1 for floating Point numbers now what I'll do is I'll talk about real variables and we have two types of real variables we cannot do in equal to 7.7 this is wrong 7.7 is not an integer it's a real number it contains a decimal and a number after it so we'll have to use something called float so we say float a is equal to 7.7 and this will store this number accurately and correct correctly so character variables similarly we have character variables which are nothing but uh character containers they simply store characters and you can store A Single Character inside these character variables they take one bite in memory and uh let's not talk about receiving input from the user so what I'll do is I'll create a file l04 input. C and what this input do c will do is it will prompt a user to take an input so let let me show this to you let me delete all these U terminals I've opened a lot of terminals I don't want that I'll remove these variables as well now what I'll do is I'll say print if enter your number okay and I'll simply say int a to declare an integer so basically what I'm doing is just like if you want to have an empty container ready to store something in your house you go to the market and you come back from the market and keep that container safely so that whenever you have something to store you can simply put it inside that container in a very similar way what I'm doing is I'm declaring an integer so in case I have an integer to store in my program I can use this container or variable and I can say a is equal to 8 and it will be stored inside a so I have simply declared a variable now what I'll do is I'll use a function called scanf and I'll simply say percentage D because I want to take a number as an input and I'll simply say am person a and let me explain this thing to you because this might sound very scary and also let me show you something before we discuss about this I'll say print F your number is percentage D and I'll simply say a and definitely I'll put a semicolon let me run this program and see what happens enter your number six your number is six let's try this program once again and see if it works for variable inputs yes it does your number is three how is this thing working so scanf is basically a function it's a library function and you can use scanf to take input from the user so what you are doing is you are saying to the compiler that I am going to enter an integer from the keyboard kindly store that integer at this location simply look at the syntax and you are good to go so if you look at the syntax scanf percentage D and uh the memory location where you want to put that number which you are going to enter this is all you need to know about scanf at this point in the course I'm going to explain you more about scanf and functions in the future but let's look at this am percent operator this is very important I've even written this uh red color in the notes this am percent is important am person is the address of operator and it means that the supplied value value should be copied to the address which is indicated by variable I so when I say % I I'm saying the memory location of I in the memory the location of I in the memory is ENT I and what is I I is the value at that memory location I don't want to know which location I just want to know the value let us say I'm talking about you I'm talking about a guy named sham if I say sham is a good boy I'm commenting on sham if I say m person sham is a good place I'm simply saying the place where sham recites is very good I'm not commenting on sham sham can be a good boy or sham can be a bad guy as well I'm not commenting on me I'm simply commenting on the place where sham is living I hope this address of operator is clear to you so that was about chapter number one I hope you like chapter number one and you enjoy the concepts of variable constants and keywords but this is not it we are going to practice is chapter number one and the concepts in chapter number one using a practice set we are going to move to chapter one practice set where we are going to solve few questions so let's move on to chapter one practice set and solve some problems now that we have learned so much about C we are going to look into this practice set so that we can practice the concepts that we have learned so far so the question number one says write a c program to calculate area of a rectangle and it is going to be very simple because we are going to use hardcoded inputs also we'll use scanner function to supply input from the user end let's start coding this problem so what I'm going to do now is I'm simply going to create a new file which is program number five and I'll simply say pr01 Doc which basically means that I am going to um I'm going to write the first problem solution of my practice it so what I'll show you is the moment I just see boiler plate code so I simply said Boi and press enter you'll see that something happened how did I do this I want to show you so if you click on your settings in Visual Studio code and you go to Snippets user Snippets and you go to c. Json you can add something like this and this will basically be the shortcut to type a very long boilerplate code repeatedly let me explain so what I'm doing is I'm adding to this Json a key value pair which is an object so if you don't know what Json is simply copy this you can look into this stuff and directly make your c. Json look something like this so we have a prefix we have a body we have a description prefix is something you will use whenever you want this body to be added to your program make sure that you use back sln for new lines and also back SLT for tabs uh if you look into my code you can see that I have a tab here a tab here just because I had back /t here so make sure that you type this and then you can add description of your choice and we can have as many Snippets as we want in this particular c. Json if you're not able to add snippet for any reason maybe you are in some different source code editor or something do not bother about that because you know what you'll simply have to type these many lines that's about it you don't have to worry and if you have the cheat sheet that I've supplied to you so let me show you the cheat sheet I'll simply go to my website and the blog and we'll open the C language cheat sheet you simply copy this and you can paste it in and that's about it you have this boilerplate code okay so you can add your code here and you know what you can simply either use the boiler plate or use the cheat sheet it doesn't matter you should know how to use both of these things let's come back to the problem I'll simply say in a is equal to 4 and say in B is equal to 7 what is A and B A and B is nothing but the height and width of U of my rectangle so I have to Simply calculate area of the rectangle so using hard coded input so what is the area of rectangle I'll simply use print F I'll say the area of rectangle is um I'll simply multiply a by B I'll say percentage D and I'll perform a calculation I'll say a star B and that should do that should do the trick so percentage D is for integer my a is an integer B is an integer a is the width B is the height and a multip by B will give me the area of the rectangle let me run this program for you and show you that the area of the rectangle is 28 because 7 * 4 is 28 and this program works what if I want to use a user supplied input in that case I'll simply declare a and B and then I'll simply say scanf percentage D and I'll want my user to enter a and I'll do the same for B but before I make my user enter something I'll simply put a message for him I'll say enter the value of length back sln and then I'll say enter the the value of breadth dth and if I enter the value of the breadth it will be stored in B because I've WR be here let's run this program and the value of length eight and the value of breadth let me say three and you can see 24 what if I go for five and two it should be 10 and yes it is so the area of the rectangle has been calculated using the hardcoded inputs and using the inputs supplied by the user now what we are going to do is we are going to calculate the area of a circle and modify the same program to calculate the volume of a cylinder given its radius and height if you don't know man duration or you are not into a lot of mathematics bear with me I'm going to explain everything to you so this question says calculate the area of a circle which is p pi r squ so let's prepare for calculating the area of a circle in a program called 06 p02 doc let me add the boiler plate code and I'll say int R is equal to 4 and now what I'll do is I'll say print F the area of circle is percentage D and what I'll do is I'll put down the value of pi and then I'll simply say R and then once again I'll say R so Pi * R * R is the area of the circle P pi r squ let's run this program and see the area of the circle is this thing uh which is a bit problematic because I have used percentage D I should have used percentage F because this is going to evaluate to a floating Point number so this is something that you need to remember now if I run you'll see 50.2 4 4 * 4 is 16 * 3.14 will be approximately around 50.2 4 which makes sense okay I hope hope you understood this now I have to modify the same program to calculate the volume of a cylinder which is p piun r² * H where H is the height of the cylinder let me show you these formulas area of circle and also I want to show you volume of a cylinder so area of the circle is P piun R square I'll enter the value of R and it will show me U the area so when the area is four uh sorry the radius is four the area is around 50.26548 and I'll say multiply by h four and five four and five let's see what we get we got 21.2 and yes we got something very close once again I'm using an approximate value of pi 2 point Sorry 3.14 is an approximate value of pi so make sure you understand that the value of pi you are using might be a bit different from what is being used in the online formulas because of which our results are going to be a a bit different so they got 25133 and I got 21.2 which is pretty close but again not exact just because of the value of pi but congratulations we have solved this problem moving on to the next question right a program to convert Celsius degrees temperature to Fahrenheit so what I'll do is I'll say celius to forhe and here is the formula I'm going to copy this formula as is and before that what I'm going to do is I'm going to write a new program name 07 pr03 and this is a c program so I'll say boiler plate code I'll simply cut this and uh I'll simply write a comment here I I'll simply refer to this formula I'm not going to use it exactly I'll say n c is equal to 5 and I'll use printf and I'll say [Music] the value of temperature in fenit is percentage F and I'm going to use this formula but it'll be easy for me if I use something like this let me paste this formula let me fix uh this formula and replace x with star because in C star is the multiplic ation operator not not X okay so I'll simply say C multiply by 9 by 5 let me close it in the brackets and yes this works and I'm going to Simply say F let me write semicolon at the end of print F and also at the end of this expression and this should do the trick so if I say C is equal to 4 I should get 36 let me punch in four I got 39 looks like there is some problem with my formula so let me see what the problem with my formula is I think I've replace the value of C wrongly so this should be C * by 9 by five and uh yeah I got the I got the problem so the problem is that the value of C is an integer 9 is an integer five is an integer simply say 9.0 / 5.0 and I'm going to explain to you why this is the case why you need to use 0 Z so let me run this and the and we get the correct answer but allow me to quickly answer you this question that why did 9x5 not work and why is this 9.0 by 5.0 is working so whenever there is an operation between integer and integer in C the resultant is also an integer so 9x 5 will be rounded off to the nearest integer and this will be the value and then it is multiplied by C and then 32 is added to it which creates a lot of error when we say 9.0 by 5.0 we get the exact value in decimal because this is evaluating to a float Float by float is a float int by int is an INT so this value will be a float multiply by an integer as a float and then we add an integer as a float so this is why we are getting uh the correct value using this formula I hope you understood it I hope you got the point now coming back to the next question which is write a program to calculate simple interest for a set of values representing principle number of years and rate of interest and this is very straightforward I'll show you something uh simple interest formula and simple interest formula is really very simple it's PRT ided 100 so if you want to calculate the interest this is uh PRT by 100 but a is a amount so you need to use PRT divided by 100 so why divided by 100 because we have the rate of interest in percentage if the rate of interest is not in percent then you can simply use the decimal rate and then you don't need divided by 100 but you if you have the rate of interest in percentage then you need to do divided by 100 so if you have 4% rate of interest 9% rate of interest then you definitely will have to do divided by 100 so simply apply this calculation use PRT divided by 100 and that's about it you'll get the answer I want you guys to comment below if you have solved this problem I want each and everyone of you to comment and say that we have solved question number four I have solved question number four take accountability of yourself and tell me what is the answer for the simple interest if the value of principle is 100 number of years are four and rate of interest is six let me repeat it 100 4 and six rate of interest is 6% for the four years principal amount is 100 how much will be the final amount how much will be the simple interest you need to calculate the simple interest so tell me the simple interest tell me what will be the simple interest for these values I am waiting for your comments I hope everybody posted the comment and also don't mention to put the time stamp when you commenting so that I'll know where or which part of the video you are at when you are commenting I I hope you enjoyed practicing all these questions from chapter 1 practice set now we'll move on to chapter 2 and we'll Explore More concepts of C let's move on to chapter 2 now so what I'll do now is I'll open this chapter 2 PDF so let me open it in my Chrome browser and in my opinion Chrome browser is the best PDF viewer in my opinion I mean there are a lot of other PDF viewers and it doesn't even matter if you have a very powerful computer coming back to the C topic chapter 2 instructions and Opera what are instructions instruction is something you tell computer to do just like you give instruction to your younger brother to bring something or your dad to bring something from the market while he's in the market or your mom might give you instruction to get some groceries uh in a very similar way we use C program to give instructions to the computer so a c program is a set of instructions it is collection of instructions indeed so if I show you my my vs code you can see that this particular C program is set of this instruction this instruction this instruction and this instruction so coming back to the notes instructions are nothing but instructions are nothing but commands for computer to do something just like uh uh if you want to prepare a particular dish you will have certain set of instructions add salt add pepper maybe you'll have some instructions of marinating something for some time these are all instructions for preparing a particular dish you might want to um you know cook some vegetable you might want to cook some oat meal and there is a way to get there basically using some set of instructions in a very similar way we write programs and their collection of instructions now let's talk about types of instructions what are the types of instructions we can give um to a computer using C programming so if I show you my VSS code you can see this particular type of instruction and this particular type of instruction are a bit different they are not exactly the same they're not exactly telling the computer to store something in the memory this particular instruction is saying that store four inside this variable C at some place in computer's memory and this particular instruction is saying print this particular thing in the console fetch the value of F and for format it this way print it in a way that it looks beautiful just like this so this is an instruction and this is instruction but these two are different types of instructions so coming back to the notes there are three types of instructions primarily first one is type declaration instruction second one is arithmetic instruction third one is control instruction so let's talk about type declaration instruction remember we talked about int a float b car c we can have even more data types and we can use those data types to declare a variable so when we say int a we are basically saying Reserve four bytes in memory which is taken by int so an integer in C language takes four bytes what I'm telling my computer is hey computer please reserve four bytes in memory I want four bytes to be reserved in the memory so int a means Reserve four bytes in the memory float b means Reserve 4 bytes in the memory for a floating Point number then there are some other variations of this type declaration instruction int I is equal 10 J is equal to I int a is equal to 2 so basically here I'm saying give I the value of 10 so 10 is a constant and it will be stored inside I when I say J is equal to I what I'm telling my computer is I'm saying fetch the value of I and put it inside J then when I say in T is equal to 2 I'm assigning a with two and in a very similar manner we can have such kinds of variations of type declaration function but if I do something like this float B is equal to a + 3 float a is equal to 1.1 this is going to throw an error as we are trying to use a before defining it so you need to define a thing first remember in C language instructions are executed from top to bottom so they are executed one after the other so this will be executed first this instruction will be executed after that this will be executed after that and this after that and so on so here if I say in C is equal to 4 I can actually use C in this particular instruction but if I try to use C in some instruction and then I Define c that is going to get me into big trouble okay so I hope that you understood this I hope this concept is clear to you now int ABCD is a shortcut to tell please Reserve four bytes for a b c and d so this is a shortcut so instead of writing in a in b and c and d in four different lines we have a shortcut we are writing all these things at once in ABCD and if we say a equal to b equal to Cal D is equal to 30 value of a b c and d will be 30 each I hope this thing is clear to you now let's talk about arithmetic instructions in I is equal to 3 * 2 + 1 when we do something like this what we are telling our computer is perform these calculations we are telling our computer perform three mtip by two and then add one to it so basic mathematics but let's see some terminology when I say inti is equal to 3 * 2 + 1 uh here star and plus are operators and these numbers are operant so basically we have these operants which are operated upon by The Operators so op operator can actually operate on these operant and then produce a result and that result can be stored inside I so when I say in I is equal to three star 2 + 1 basically 6 will be the result of three star two and when I say three star 2 + 1 then it will be 6 + 1 which will be 7even oper operant can be in float Etc it can be anything and plus minus times divide our arithmetic operators okay there are some other arithmetic operators as well but these are the most basic ones then if is a b is equal 2 comma c isal 3 it means Please assign B with 2 and C with 3 and when I say int Z is equal to B * by C or rather if I say in Z and then after semicolon I say Z is equal to B * by C this is legal but if I say in Z and I say B multip by C is equal to Z this is illegal this is not allowed because when I say Z is equal to B * by C the right right hand side will be evaluated first in this case when I say B multiply by C is equal to Z the right hand side doesn't have any value this is illegal you cannot do that so whenever you want to assign something to a variable this needs to be clear answer this should have a clear value B multip by C here has a clear value of 2 and three because V is clear it's the value two c is value three and B multi by c will be value six so we are all clear on what B is what C is and hence we are clear on what B multip by C is but had we not had this b isal 2 c isal 3 instead of this if there was just in B comma C this would have created an error so I hope you understood this and we'll practice and we'll see how these things are working so you don't have to worry on anything because I'm going to hold your hands and walk you through all these Concepts both in the notes and in code as well so practical is very important this is something that I totally understand and we are going to do the Practical as well now percent is modular division operator it Returns the remainder and it cannot be applied on floating Point number percent sign is same as numerator so basically when you do something like this if you say 5% 2 what is the remainder when 5 is divided by two it's one so it returns one but if I do minus 5% do I'll get minus one so sign is same as that of numerator we we rarely use minus 5% to you know modu with negative numbers is something that you will very rarely see but again if you were to see this is the rule if there is minus sign before this five it'll be transferred here so minus 5% 2 is equal to minus1 now you need to note some things no operator is assumed to be present you cannot say it I is equal to AB B just like you do in basic mathematics and ab means a multiply by B no it doesn't hold in C language there is no presumption on any operator being present if you say in I is equal to a star B yes star is present between A and B so we can multiply a and b and the value of I will be a multip by B but if such kind of operator uh is not present if you say I is equal to a this is invalid this is invalid and this is going to throw an error there is no operator to perform exponentiation in C however we can use p x X comma y from math.h more later so there's no direct operator in C to perform exponentiation if you want to create um Square you can do a star a if you want to find out cube you can do something like a star a star a but if you want to do a to the^ 39 there's no other way directly than to write a39 * manually but there is a function called pow where you can do X comma Y and it will evaluate to X to the^ Y and it is from the library matt. we are going to look into the libraries very soon later in this course but again this is something that you need to keep in your mind that yes we have a function we have a handy function it's not like you cannot do it in Z you can definitely perform exponentiation very very easily in see so we'll have to use something called power and we are going to learn matt. later so let's skip it and move ahead type conversion what is this type conversion so there is a rule that an arith Matic operation between int and int will result to an INT an arithmatic operation between int and a float will result in a float an arithmetic operation between float and Float will result in a float so at a very high level roughly I can say that int and int or rather any data type and other data type the result will be promoted to the higher data type so int and int will return an INT int and Float will return a float float and Float will return a float so 5x2 is two not 2.5 in C and A lot of people they face a lot of trouble because of this so what you have to do is 5.0 by 2.0 if you want to get the accurate answer but if you do 5.0 by two then also you can get the accurate answer if you do 2x 5 it will be zero but if you do 2.2 by 5 it be 04 reason being it will be a calculation between a float and in and it will be a float but here it will be a calculation between int and int and it is going to be an INT which is zero and hence it will be wrong wrong mathematically now let's talk about some noes uh so when you say int a is equal to 3.5 in this case 3.5 which is a float will be demoted to three because when you say in a is equal to 3.5 a cannot store 3.5 because it's an integer you cannot store a floating Point number inside an integer variable so what will happen is it will be demoted to three because a is not able to store floats this is something that you need to keep in your mind then if you say float a is equal to 8 a will store 8.0 so 8 will be converted to 8.0 and it will be a promotion to float So when you say float a is equal to 8 a will not directly store eight because a is a floating Point number and since a is a floating Point number it will definitely have decimal so float a is equal to 8.0 and Float a is equal to 8 will be the same when you say a is equal to 8 in floats it will be 8.0 by default now here's a quick quiz for you what will happen if I do int K is equal 3 3.0 / 9 what will be the value of K and Y so if I do something like 3.0 divided by 9 this particular thing will be evaluated to 3x 9 some 0.33 something uh and since this is an integer K will be zero because K cannot hold floating Point numbers now if I do something like 3.0 divided by 9 it will be 0.333 but since K is an it it cannot store floats and value this is demoted to zero and yes we can see see this we can definitely see this in action let me open this in vs code and we are going to create a first program uh let me call it demoting do C or rather let me call it calculation. C I'll put the boiler plate code I'll say int a is equal to 3.0 / by 9 if I'm not wrong yes and now what I'll do is I will simply say print F and yes I want to do print F the value of is let me say percentage D and if I try to print the value of a it is going to be zero so hence it is demoted to zero it was 3 point Sorry 0.33 but it will be demoted to zero because a cannot store floating Point numbers what will happen let me close this one what will happen if I make it float and if I make this percentage f will it be 0.33 yes it will be 0.3333 so this is something that you need to keep in mind I'll make it int because you might refer to the notes and you will uh see that program for sure now let's talk about operator presence so before I talk about operative presidence and associativity let me also tell you that this is one of the most confused topics when it comes to C language and I'm going to demystify all these things for you because in my opinion this is really very simple and these are unnecessarily Complicated by people so let's talk about operator precedence what if I do 3 star x - 8 star y it is 3x - 8 y or 3x - 8 Y what will this be evaluated to if I do something like this and see there should be a start here I want to put a star here 8 star y so is it this expression or is it this expression because these two expressions are different they are not the same this is something that you need to keep in your mind in C language simple mathematical rules like like Bard Mass no longer applies you cannot directly apply board Mass from mathematics to C you you cannot do that the answer to the above question is provided by operator precedence and associativity and operator precedence and associativity are one of the most important concepts of see let's see what these concepts are let's talk about operator precedence the following table lists the operator priority in C so the first priority is given to Star slash and person these these three have the same priority then second most priority is given to plus and minus and third most priority is given to equals to now you can Google the priority chart and you will definitely find priority of other operators but these are the most used operators and these are the operators whose parity you would want to learn yes remember all these this is not difficult to remember let me tell you the first row contains star/ and percent second one contains plus and minus and third one contains equals to so this is something that you need to remember operators of higher priority are evaluated first in absence of parenthesis so yes parenthesis will definitely evaluate first because the meaning of parenthesis is that you want something to be evaluated first but in the absence of parenthesis what happens is that priority of The Operators is checked and then these operators are applied to the operants so let's let's see this in action I want to show you this in action so I'll simply create a program called priority. C boiler plate code int a isal to 3 * 5 minus U 5 and let me also do 9 + 3 * 5 - 5 and I'll simply do print F percentage T I'll say value of a is percentage T and what I'll do is I'll write a here let me run this program the value of a is 19 let's see if we are able to use this priority table and find the value of a so 5 * 3 this will be evaluated first which is 15 then 15 + 9 is nothing but 24 minus 5 is nothing but 19 and hence the result 19 I hope you got this point now do not apply board Mass here some people might argue that board mass is directly being applied here no do not apply board Mass you have have to go with operator presidence and associativity because sometimes in a very rare case maybe B Mass might not work because these expressions are not evaluated using Bard mass or some other mathematical rule for that matter these are evaluated using operator precedence and associativity so you need to keep this in your mind now coming to operators of higher PRI valuated first now let's talk about associativity so we talked about Pres what is associativity when operators of equal parity are present in an expression the tie is taken care of by associativity so what if you have a star and divide what will be performed first so let me show you an example of this what if instead of this I had this 9 ided 3 * by say 27 - 5 now if you perform this thing first then yes uh answer will be different if if you perform this thing first answer is going to be different what is the rule that c follows so firstly what we do is we know that either slash which is divide or star is going to be executed first but which one out of these and let's see what the associativity rule says so when The Operators of equal priority are present in an expression the ti is taken care of by associativity so XR y by Z is evaluated to xar y ided z x by y star Z is evaluated to X x y y star Z and Stars slash follows left to right associativity so what is left to right associativity left to right associativity simply means that you need to evaluate the left expression first then the right so 9 by 3 will be 3 let me write a comment for you so it will be 3 * 27 minus 5 which will be 27 * 3 - 5 which is 49 okay so let's see if we get 49 so this is nothing but 3 * by 3 * 9 which is 9 * 9 which is 81 - 5 which is nothing but 76 okay so let's see if we get 76 and if I run this program the value of a is 76 yes this works so star and slash follows left to right associativity and we need to evaluate them from left to right always remember okay when it comes to remembering the priority and associativity let me tell you something this is all you need to remember number and you'll be able to solve most of the questions 99% of the questions but in some of the rare cases you might want to Google the priority of some of the miscellaneous operators so the rule will be applied just like this first find the priority once you have the priority you need to evaluate the operators which have the higher priority which one will be evaluated first you need to find the associativity if it is left to right then yes you will um you'll use um the left to right associativity to evaluate those operators go move from left towards the right and keep on solving The Operators I hope you got the point I hope this is clear let's talk about control instructions remember we were talking about instructions uh we had type declaration instruction arithmetic instruction then the third one was control instruction the type declaration function look like this sorry instruction look like this then arithmetic instruction looked like this now let's talk about control instructions now there are four types of control instructions in C it determines the flow of control in a program what is a control instruction it determines the flow of control in a program where to go when what will be executed first so there is a sequence control instruction there's a decision control instruction there's a loop control instruction and there is a case control instruction sequence control instruction is nothing but what we already saw then there is something called decision control instruction we'll look into if else in the later chapters and you will come to know what decision control instruction is then we have Loop control instruction which is nothing but some of the loops y Loops for Loops do wi Loops we'll look into Loops do not worry about loops but this is one of the control instructions is something that you need to remember you might want to come back to this page from the notes when we look into uh look into Loops andl statements and switch case statements so case control instruction is something that uh we'll look into later as well so these are the pH instructions we are going to look into the later chapters and let's now do something which can strengthen our concepts of instructions and operators let's go to chapter 2 practice set and solve for some of the questions on instructions and operators let's move to chapter two practice set now now before we look into the C chapter 2 practice set I want to discuss few things and these things are going to be really important so listen to me very very carefully we'll look into the data types and see so we'll learn about the four major data types in C which are cars so let me Mark it as question number one so program number three question number one from the practice set and do c is the extension let me write down the boilerplate code and let me write down the first character so let me type it down uh there are four major data types in C what is the first one in C we'll talk about the first one and the first one is uh let me also put something like this it's int then we have then we have float for floating Point numbers then we have car and car is for characters and then we have double and double is for it's for uh decimal numbers but with double Precision than the floating Point numbers okay so this is single Precision floating Point number and let me also close this and what I'll do is I'll now write a double Precision floating Point number so let me type double here and then character is for storing characters enclosed in single code so this is something that is important you need to enclose a character in single codes you cannot do something like this to store a character you'll have to do something like this so let me type it down this is valid okay so this is important and then this is for storing integers okay so this is something that you need to keep in your mind now let's solve the question number one so coming to the question number one which of the following is invalidy first one is valid second one maybe let's check it it's invalid by the way but in case you want to check whether it's valid or not you can simply use this so if you you have done some sort of mathematics and uh you want to use this character to raise the power of 3 to three it is going to be invalid but if you want to see whether this actually runs or not this is going to run because this is a bitwise character in C so we are not going to look into bitwise characters in this video but this is actually valid this is valid in C this will this is not valid to calculate the power of 3 to the^ three so this is valid so you need to make sure that this is a valid character in C even if you don't know about a character that might be a valid character in C so this this this is the takeaway of this question basically and what about the third one is definitely invalid because you need to store a single character in a car variable you cannot store a date you can't do this so this is something which is invalid so you need to make sure that this this is valid what data type will 3.2 / 8 -2 return and this is clearly very simple this this particular thing will return a float and the entire thing will return a float right or wrong wrong let me show you why so um I know I know you are you might be thinking that uh why is it wrong what what what's wrong about this so let me tell you so this is problem number 2.c let me put the boiler plate code and let me show you so what I'll do is I'll simply say uh uh 3.0 / 8 - 2 so if I do something like this uh I'll say 3. 6666 what is this is it a double is it a float it's by default a double so whenever you write a decimal number in C by default it is double but sometimes it might depend upon the compiler but in most of the cases it is double by default so since this is double so the entire thing is going to be double so let me save this program for you and let me also show you why this entire thing will return double double divided by integer will be a double double minus integer will be a double so this will return a double data type I hope that this is clear and you are able to grasp the concept I want to teach you write a program to check whether the number is divisible by 97 or not and this is going to be simple let me change this to pr03 pr02 was very simple so I just want to check whether a number is divisible by 97 or not so I'll say int a is equal to let us say I have a number which is 194 and I want to check whether this is divisible by 97 or not so what I'll do is I'll do print F and I'll do percentage D and let me see if I get a remainder so I'll say a% 97 uh and let's see whether this is divisible by 97 or not so run this program I get zero so the remainder is zero which means it is divisible what about 195 uh it's one remainder is one so this is not divisible by 195 97 doesn't divide 195 so 195 is not divisible by 97 okay I hope you got this point and this is a program to check whether a number is divisible by 97 or not now I want you to refactor this program and convert it to a program which takes an input from the user I want you to write a program which takes an input from the user Yes you heard that right now uh this is it for this question I hope you will accept the challenge and show me the program wherein you are accepting input from the user I want all of you to comment that program um in the comment section make sure to write the time stamp so that I can see which question you have solved okay coming back to the practice set question number four says explain step bystep evaluation of this thing where x equal 2 Y is equal 3 and Z is equal to 3 and K is equal one and this is important this is very important so it's 3x / y - Z + K let me write it down let me create a new file and then write it down okay so let me put the boiler plate code I'll say in result is equal to and let me write it down 3x by y - Z 3x by y - Z + K but we we still have to write down all these um all these variables X is 2 Y is 3 Z is 3 and K is 1 okay so X is 2 Y is 3 Z is 3 and K is 1 okay so let's try to find out what this particular thing will return and yes you can always say int result is equal to expression this will put the value of the expression into result variable also what I'll do is I'll use my printf I'll say the value of result is and I'll do percentage D okay and I'll say result but we need to explain the step byep evaluation so the first thing we are going to see is the priority or rather precedence what is the Precedence which which one is the operator with highest precedence star and divide are the operators with highest precedence what is the associativity because we have two such operators one is star and one is divide it is left to right so 3 * X will be evaluated first which is going to be 6 so let me write it down 6 ided and the rest of the numbers will be uh written as is 6 / 3 - 3 + 1 okay so this is going to be the resulting expression now what I'll do is I'll simply evaluate 6x3 to 2 why because this is going to be the operator with highest precedence star and divide are the operators with highest precedence let me show this to you if you have not seen it previously um I've written it down in the notes for you so if you look at the priority of these operators you will see the first priority is given to these operators second is to these operators now we since we have operator with the topmost priority we will have to evaluate it to the integer now 2 - 3 + 1 is going to be zero so the answer answer should be zero and let's see if this is the case and yes this is the case answer is zero so this is how we can evaluate this particular thing step by step now this is a this is an important question what is this is it a 3.0 is 3.0 + 1 an integer character floating Point number it is going to be a floating Point number for sure but not float it is going to be double and it might depend on the compiler as well your compiler might store the default floating Point number as floats you never know you can always design a compiler which stores a floating Point number as a float but in my case the compiler I'm using it is a double but it's always a floating Point number so B is the correct answer I hope you were able to understand all the concepts pretty well and the moment we you know start exploring more and more Concepts in this particular course the basic things are going to be clear for example uh we can we can do something like this is something which you know now we can do something like this is something you know now you always knew that we can do intx samigon so all these things are going to make your life easy all these programs that I'm going to make for you are going to make your life easy when it comes to the revision so make sure you download the notes you you don't know how much hard work I have put into you know bring these notes for free for all of you I would appreciate if you download it and start learning C and become a champion of c and if it helps you that is a huge win for me let's move on to chapter 3 now where we are going to understand the concept of conditionals so now that we have some good idea of the C programming language let's move towards chapter number three I'm going to open this PDF that I've created for you and let's see what this PDF has to say so I have written some of the lines which will sound a bit fun and it'll make things easier to understand for you for example conditional instruction is something that might sound boring but I have tried to make things interesting so this chapter is about conditional instructions what exactly are conditional instructions most of the computer programs use conditional expressions and what does this mean they simply mean that whenever you are writing a program you might want to do something and you would want to execute an instruction only when a certain condition is true so I've written this sometimes you want to watch comedy videos on YouTube if the day is Sunday so if the day is Sunday you might want to watch a comedy video on YouTube otherwise you might want to watch some study videos on YouTube sometimes we order junk food if it is a friend's birthday in the hostel so you might be dieting uh year round but when it's your friend's birthday or your birthday or some other friends birthday you might you know Ease on your dating and you might go out and eat some junk food or maybe order it from outside so in all these scenarios what happens is based of a certain condition you are doing something based of some condition you are doing something you're watching comedy video when the day is Sunday you are eating junk food when it's your friends bir in the hostel you might want to buy an umbrella if it's raining and you have the money so there are two conditions here if it's raining and if you have the money if you have the money then only you'll go and buy the umbrella otherwise you would not want to buy the umbrella you order the meal if Dal or your favorite Bindy is listed on the menu so if your favorite food item is listed on the menu then only you will go and order the meal okay so these are some of the conditions based on which you are performing certain actions all these are decisions which depend on a certain condition being met in C language 2 we must be able to execute instructions on a condition or more than one condition being met so this is decision making instruction in C so we have two types of decision- making instructions in C we can use an F ladder we can use just an if and also we can use switch statement so we'll look at F statements and switch statements one by one so let's get started by opening this folder in vs code so let me open this folder in vs code so simply right click and click on open vs code open in code and let me write the very first program for you so I'll simply say if else doc I'll put the Boiler code uh boiler plate code down here and I'll show you something let us say I have a variable and I'm assigning three inside a variable which is an integer and the name of the variable is a now what I want to do is I want to check if a is greater than three or rather four it can be either three or four I want to print a is greater than 4 okay otherwise what I'll do I'll do nothing I'll not print anything or if I want to print something when a is not greater than four I'll simply say print F print F and I'll say a is greater than is not greater than four okay so uh I'll simply do this and I'll press a semicolon and now what I'll do is run this program and you'll see that this program is executed and a is not greater than four because a is three now what if I make a 32 and if I run it you'll see a is greater than four so this is an example of if else conditional statement coming back to the notes we have another type of conditional or rather decision making instruction in C which is switch case statement so we just saw the syntax ofl statement we simply write condition to be checked inside if and if that condition turns out to be true then what we do is we simply write some statements or um we write some instructions which we want to get executed and if that condition is not true then else is executed so it's kind of simple plain and simple English when we write this if else statement if this happens do this else do this so this is just to make things easier for the programmer uh at a very low level these instructions are compiled into some other instructions which your CPU can understand but we are not going to go into those details what we want to do here is we simply want to be able to write IFL statements we want to write some conditions inside C inside if and uh whenever those conditions are true we want some statements to be executed and if those conditions are not true then we want something else to be executed so let's see a code example uh just like I show you this example here we have another example where we have an integer variable a the value inside this integer variable is 23 if a is greater than 18 we are simply saying yes you can drive otherwise you cannot drive uh I don't have any else here and that's totally fine you can simply have an F without an else and if that condition is true then only these statements will be executed otherwise these statements will not be executed so when I say int a is equal 23 I can simply say print F you can drive if a is greater than 18 now note that else block is not necessary but optional else block is optional so you can either have else or you can simply have an if and that's totally fine even from our program here if I comment out my L statement let me show you this program works perfectly so let me show you the terminal so a is greater than four and if I make it two if I save the program and run it once again nothing happens because I don't have an L statement here but the moment I comment uh uncomment it and run the program a is not greater than four is printed which means that now a is not greater than four so I'm actually able to check whether the value of a is greater or lesser than a constant which is four so now in C language I'm able to write some logical things I'm able to perform some logical operations I can check whether certain condition is true or not I can compare a variable with a constant I can compare two values which is pretty cool and we are going to look more into this so note that else block is not necessary but it's optional and we just saw that now let's talk about about relational operators in C what are relational operators in C so don't get scared by the names of these relational operators logical operators these are really very simple let me tell you just understand the concept behind it you don't even have to remember down the line which one is relational which one is logical because you are going to automatically remember all these things in programming whenever a beginner comes to learn all these things what they think is that they will not be able to learn so many terminologies in programming but believe you're going to remember everything by yourself and at this point do not focus on remembering what relational operator is how many types of relational operators are there but rather practice and write more and more programs that will get you the programming success that you want so let's talk about relational operator and C relational operators are used to evaluate conditions true or false inside the if statements some examples of relational operators are double equals to note that this is double equals it's not single equals single equal to in C is assignment operator and you don't have to confuse equals to with dou equals to dou equals to is a comparison operator which will tell whether two values are equal or not now this greater than equal to will tell you whether a value is greater than or equal to some other value or not similarly we have just greater than and less than then less than equal to not equal to is exclamation mark and then equal to so this is not equal to and U this is also so uh something that we are going to use a lot in this course so you need to remember a bit all of these operators initially and um you don't have to mify all these things what I want you to do is just reference these notes and you know look look up all these things and once you write few programs everything is going to sound very very simple to you so I have an important note here equals to is used for assignment whereas double equal to is used for equality check I just told you this that that beginners will confuse this double equals to with single equal to and you don't have to do that equal to is assignment operator and we have already used equal to here we in fact we just used it in this program in a is equal to 2 here we are not comparing a with two but rather what we are doing is we are assigning the value to inside of this variable a so you need to understand this coming back to the notes double equal to is comparison operator which will actually tell whether two values are equal to each other or not now the condition can can be any valid expression and see a nonzero value is considered to be true this is super important and let me shout here so that you know I can emphasize that this is super duper important and I'm shouting like this so that I can emphasize enough on this any nonzero value is considered to be true in C and you must be thinking why I'm so excited all of a sudden I want to emphasize on this thing any nonzero value is considered to be true so even if I put if1 this is true even if I put if 10 if 10 is considered as true whatever is there inside the if block will get executed you don't have to have a greater than four or you know a less than 5 or a dou equal to 10 no you don't have have to do that even if you have a nonzero value if it is a non-zero value your if block is going to execute for sure this is something that you need to remember here now what I'll do is I'll simply come back to the notes and uh the condition can be any valid expression and see nonzero values consider to be let me emphasize a bit more and I know that you you'll think that why am I emphasizing so much but this is important and I can't emphasize more on this let me write a program for you nonzero Doc and what I want to tell in this program is that if you have a nonzero value and if you write something like this print F by the way uh I write programs in python as well which is why you know whenever I type I just write print but that's fine even if you're coding in multiple programming language uh evaluated to True uh or rather let me tell any nonzero value is evaluated true semicolon save and if I run this any non-zero Valu is evalu to true this is something that you need to know and a lot of people will tell me why are you emphasizing so much you have written it in the notes you have told it several times but this concept is very important which is why I have to emphasize it this way let's talk about logical operators now we just talked about relational operators and um I hope that you will understand uh what relational operators are just try out these operators greater than equal to less than less than equal to I think this is pretty straightforward and you don't have to you know uh rather I don't have to show you each and every operator inside of if statement I I hope that you'll practice practice all these operators yourself now let's write another program and we are going to talk about logical operators in this program so let me write a boiler plate code and uh let's talk about logical operators double and or and exclamation mark this is actually a pipe sign double pipe this is double end this is double pipe in case you are wondering where is pipe in your keyboard let me show it to you can you see this key this key this one this is the pipe okay I know that it sounds really crazy me holding the keyboard and you know holding it in front of the webcam but I hope that you understood let me Google keyboard and I think this is a better way of showing the pipe key so if I open this image this is the pipe key this one oops let me scroll this one so you'll have to press shift and then you'll have to press this key and this will give you a typ this is something that you might not have used a lot while you are typing or maybe surfing the web or doing anything in the computer but when you're programming you'll use this a lot so let's talk about these logical operators at a very high level and then we'll come to the notes and see what notes have to offer so I'll simply say int a is equal to uh 34 and let's um say int B is equal to 5 what if I say if a is greater than 7 and B is less than four uh let me show you how this works I'll simply say yes okay so if this happens I'll simply say yes otherwise um I don't want to say no I'll simply say yes so if a is greater than 7 is a is greater than 7 no a is not greater than 7 is B less than four no B is not less than four it's actually greater than four which is five so both these conditions are false this is false this is false false and false is false okay now let's um make things a bit interesting here let me make this two so one of these conditions is true a greater than 7 is false B less than 4 is true false and true will evaluate to false okay so a is greater than 7 is true actually uh my bad a is greater than 7 is true and B is less than 4 is also true now so B is also less than 4 2 is less than four and 34 is greater than 7even so both of these conditions are true now so true and true will evaluate to true but if I make one of these conditions as false it will not return Yes but if I make it two it will return Yes and uh I know that this is a bit confusing at this point so let me explain this to you in Greater detail and that's why I've written these notes for you okay so we have three operators and or and not these are the three most used logical operators and or and not not now what we'll do is um we'll simply use it in our programs these operators are read as and or and not they are used to provide logic to a c programs okay so that's why they are called logical operators and I have put them down in the notes really very well and uh let me tell you what I mean when I say that so this is the end operator we have used this end operators on two conditionals okay so these are two values which will evaluate to either true or false now now what we are doing is we are operating on 1 and zero so uh let's talk about end operator it is true when both the conditions are true so if you say true and true it will be true otherwise it is going to be false if you have true and false it will be false if you have false and false definitely it would be false if you have false and true it will be false so 1 and zero is evaluated to false by the way one is true in C any non-zero value is true in C and zero is false in c z and Z is evaluated to false one and one is evaluated to true and even if you think about it from the language the English language perspective just think about it when you say I want this and this it means that you want both the things doesn't mean that you want one of these things so whenever you have one and one then only that condition will be valuated to true if I say that you are a good boy and you live in New York so you'll have to be a good boy and you will have to live in New York for this entire statement to be be true so both of this both of the um operant should be true when I operate these two operant with end both of these operant should be true both of these conditions should be true you should be a good boy you should live in New York then only this entire statement is going to be true if you are a good boy and you don't live in New York no this entire statement is false uh if you if you don't live in New York if you live in chamoli and let us say then I say that you are a good boy and you live in New York York no you don't live in New York you live in chamoli so the thing is that this entire statement is going to be false so one and Z is evaluated to false 0 and 0 is EV Val to Falls one and one is EV Valu to Falls now that we have spent so much time on and operator or operator is going to be super clear to you or means Choice what would you like to have you have two options either you can have chapati or you can have uh rice you can have these two things what do you want to have so you can have either chapati or rice you can't have both of these so if going to a mess and they they tell you that uh you can either have chapati or you can have rice what do you want so you cannot say that I want both of these things no they are not going to give that either they'll give you chapati or they're going to offer you rice based on your choice in a very similar way if you say true or false one of these conditions is true so it will valuate to true false or true one of these conditions is true so entire statement will be evaluated to true but if you sayal false and false that will be false okay so our operator will evaluate to True when it is operated on 1 or zero one or 1 one 0 or 1 but if we have 0 or 0 it will be valuated to false rest of the things will be valuated to true so zero or zero is false rest is true okay I hope that uh I'm able to explain this pretty well now uh let's talk about not operator and not operator is important because it will simply invert true to false and false to true so this is also called an inverter this not operator is called an inverter and no I'm not talking about this inverter no this I'm not talking about this inverter no don't don't confuse it with this inverter I am talking about inverter inverter means something which can invert which can make true as false and false is true okay so this is going to return true if uh it is supplied false and if you supply true to it it will return false as simple as that I hope that uh this makes sense now if I say not off three dou equal to 3 so you'll have to evaluate this first 3al to 3 is actually true because 3 is equal to 3 and when I'm saying double equal to I mean is 3 equal to 3 or not yes it is so this is true but not of true is going to false uh is going to be false because not operator is an inverter so this entire thing will evaluated to false now if I say 3 greater than 30 and I put a not outside of it 3 is not greater than 30 so this thing is false but since we have a not operator outside of it this is going to valuate to true I hope that this makes sense to all of you as the number of conditions increases the level of indentation increases this reduces readability logical operators come to rescue in such cases and let me tell you what I mean by this statement so let us say you have an you have an if statement now you have another if statement inside that if statement and then again you have another if statement inside that if statement and you keep on going so what happens is your program will start from here and you'll find your program going here because you will have if if if if if if if if and you will you know keep on indenting keep on ending until your program looks ugly so what you will do is you will want to write something like this and that will actually give a better logic to your program and we are going to use these logical operators in the practice set so in case you are not able to understand this you'll have to uh just wait for the practice set and listen to these Concepts download these notes read about all these operators I know if you are a beginner it might be little bit difficult to wrap all these Concepts around your head but again I can assure you that by the end of this course you are going to have each and everything including pointers dynamic memory location crystal clear in your mind this is the guarantee so let's move ahead with this guarantee and um as the number of condition increases the level of we just talked about this let's talk about else if Clause something that we have not yet talked about else if what is this else if we talked about if we talked about else we didn't talk about elsf okay so let me show you a scenario let me create a program for you I'll call it lf. C I'll put the boiler plate code what if I say if a is greater than five um Let me let me let me say int age is equal to 45 and let me say int uh Place code is equal to 12 let us say we have 12 places and a person can have an age and he can have a place code where he has got his passport okay now what I want is I want to say if a is greater than five if a is um or rather if a is greater than 18 if a is greater than 18 then what you do is you simply print sorry I should write age if age is greater than 18 you simply print uh you are eligible to drive okay you are eligible to drive else if uh AG is not greater than 18 so I'll say else if so I'll have something inside there uh and let me explain explain you how this is different from a normal if else okay so let me write it down first and then I'll explain it to you so if age is greater than 18 then you do this else if AG is if age is not greater than 18 then definitely age is less than 18 so we'll check if age is greater than 15 we'll simply say you are eligible you are not eligible to drive you are not eligible to drive but we will check for a toy vehicle for you okay we can do something like this so let us say we have uh 12 places and uh inside all these 12 places we have some uh toy vehicles on rent which people with age greater than 15 can drive okay now what I can do is I can simply say else sorry you are a kid and cannot drive okay so now if I run this program so the age is 45 so what will happen is this thing will get executed first and this condition will be checked for that so is age greater than 18 or not the answer is true since the answer is true this will get executed and since this is executed this will not get executed this will not get executed so what I mean to say by this is that this entire thing is one single entity this is one single entity and what does it mean it simply means that either this or this or this will be executed but if we have only if statements all those conditions will be checked so let me compare this so let me create two scenarios for you so this is scenario one and let me also create another scenario for you and uh we'll compare these two scenarios so what I'll do is I'll simply comment out scenario number one okay and let me create a scenario number two for you and inside the scenario number two what I'll do is I'll simply say if age is less than 15 okay less than equal to 15 maybe so what I'm doing is in scenario 2 I'm checking three different conditions so how will C compiler decode this scenario to what it will do is it it will see the value of age is 45 so the value of age is 45 now what it'll do is since the value of age is 45 what it will do is it will check whether this 45 is greater than 18 or not is it greater than 18 yes it is greater than 18 it will print you are eligible to drive but instead of stopping and skipping the other conditions what it will do is it will once again check for this condition 45 greater than 15 45 is greater than 15 yes what it will do is it will print this once again and again it will check whether 45 is less than or equal to 15 is 45 less than or equal to 15 yes it is uh no it is not I was just kidding I was just checking whether you are attentive or not 45 is not less than equal to 15 okay so this is not going to get printed now you are eligible to drive will be printed you are not eligible to drive will be printed so this will this will get a bit confusing so let me show you so this this is this is printed let me add a back sln after all these statements so that you know we have some pretty output so I'll simply say back sln so I'll say back sln and um yeah I'll run this program uh so you are eligible to drive you are not eligible to drive but we'll check for a toy vehicle for you so both of these conditions are executed let me commment this add you out do not try to you know map the logic of whether you can drive or not I'm just showing you some if statements you don't have to think about why are these two things are printed this is because we use these if statement now let me show you how C uh C compiler is going to run through these statements what C compiler will do is it will go and check the value of H which is 45 what it will do is it will see whether age is greater than 18 or not is it greater than 18 yes it is now that we we have else if it will ignore it else will be ignored because we have already mashed one condition so what it does is that it will check for if if if this condition is not true it will go ahead and start checking for lse if is is it met is this condition true if not it will go out if there is another LF let us say we have another LF here we can have more than one lsf inside our if else ladder this is if else if else ladder this this entire thing is called One ladder and this is one single entity and only one out of these if else if else if and else will be executed only one out of these will be executed and the moment it finds one which will get executed which actually uh meets the condition in this case age greater than 18 will meet this condition this condition is true so this is executed and then this C compiler will directly jump out of this letter because we have already matched one condition one condition is true it will directly come out of this and it will start executing the statements written here so this is how plain if statements and if El letter is different I hope you got the point let me run this program and show you only you are eligible to drive is printed what if this condition was false what if I say if age is greater than 48 it will check whether age is greater than 15 or not and yes it will be greater than 15 so this will be printed and then it will stop so I'll show you uh oops I selected and ran you don't have to commit this mistake so you are not eligible to drive but we will check for a toy vehicle for use printed because this condition is matched and once the condition is matched it will forget about the entire letter and it will go out and again it will start executing the statements which are written outside this letter okay coming back to notes and this will really clear all the confusion uh because I've written it and put it in the notes in a very beautiful way instead of using multiple if statements we can also use else if along with if thus forming an if else if else letter so this is a letter and only one out of these statements will be executed using IF else if else reduces indents the last else is optional also there can be any number of else if so this is something that I've made clear in the notes you can have any number of else if you can have uh only one else and you can also omit that else if you want okay so I hope that you understood all these things now I've written something very important here that last else is executed only if all the conditions fail so if all of these conditions will fail then only this else will be executed so this is something that you need to keep in your mind once again so now we'll talk about operator precedence once again uh in the previous chapter I talked about operator precedence and I thought that you know I need to jot down some more operators for their priority because you might want to use this priority table and you should have some good amount of operators for your reference which is why I created this list for you and um i' I've added this here because I haven't added it in the previous chapter so I simply added it here okay so remember that we have a priority table of some more operators in chapter number three okay so uh now we'll talk about uh further Concepts which is a conditional operator so we have a short hand if else which um which is also called Turner operator okay it is written using a conditional let me show you how we use it so I'll simply say 05 Turner do c I will add a boilerplate code and I'll show you so what I'll do is I'll say int a equals to and what I can do is I'll say three if five or rather U say C equals do equals to B else it is going to be seven okay now if I say print um the value of a is percentage t a and yes let me finish this program because I have not defined C I'll say C and then I'll say in B = to 8 okay so C is 6 B is 8 and we have this thing which is called tary operator so how this works is if you say in AAL to 3 question marks a condition and then colon 7 so if this condition is true then three will be assigned inside a otherwise 7 will be assigned so let me run this for you and you can see the value of a is zero so it says value of a z okay so I made a mistake here this condition will come here and this value will come here so I have written this very clearly in the notes that condition then Turner operators expression if true expression is false so let me run this once again and you will see the value of a is seven why is it seven because this condition or let me you know add parenthesis so that you can easily understand that this is the condition if this condition is true then the value of a will be three otherwise it will be seven okay so this is how it works if I make it six then c equal to B will be true because c will be equal to B and if C is equal to B what is the value of a 3 let me show you the value of A3 so this is how Turner operators work this is also called shorthand IFL statement it can be written using the conditional or tary operators like this so you have a condition here question mark value if True Value if false as simple as that so I hope that you understood all these things now we are going to move towards switch case control statements what are these types of statements and why do we need these switch case statements so switch case is used when we have to make a choice between the alternatives for a given variable so let us say we have few Alternatives and and uh we want to make a choice for example let us say we have uh we are saying that press one for this two for this three for this four for this five for this and we have a lot of options now you can either press one you can either press two three or four so what I would want is I would want the user to press a key and based on what keys pressed on the keyboard I would want to do something so I hope you understood the essence of switch case statements now what I'll do is I'll simply create a program and I'll name it 06 um switch. C and uh this is going to be very very easy for you because you have already looked into APL statements so what I'll do is I'll say int age is equal to say 34 now what I'll do is I'll simply write switch uh s SW T CH and the moment I do that there is a code snippet for switch and these code Snippets are provided by the cc+ uh Plus+ extension if you don't have these Snippets do not worry you can type all these things on your own you don't have to use Snippets but again I'm using Snippets just to save time if I say if age switch age okay so I want to check whether age is a particular number or not if it is 24 I want to say I'll U remove this code I'll say printf U r24 okay now after this what I'll do is I'll put a semicolon for sure so let me put a semicolon here I'll write another case let me let me say 25 I'll say you are 25 I'll do the same for 26 I'll do the same for 27 and also I'll do the same for 28 so let me say 27 here let me say 26 here 25 is already there so we have case 28 and let me save this so case 24 you 24 you 25 26 7 8 and just ignore this break statement at this point because I'm going to talk about this break statement in a very great detail for now just forget about this break statement okay let's run this program and see what happens so the moment I run this program nothing happens because uh because I don't have 34 as the case so let me punch in 24 here and let me run this so you'll see that U24 is being printed on the screen why is this U24 being printed on the screen let me explain you how this thing works what happens is the moment you start a switch statement it starts checking for the cases so it will take the age so it will take the value of age it's 24 it will start matching is it 24 yes it is 24 if it is 24 execute this execute this execute this execute this and execute this okay uh let me give you another example what if age is 26 if age is 26 what happens is since we are doing switch on age it will take the age variable it will one by one start comparing with this is this 26 no it's not it's 24 is this 26 no it is not is this 26 yes it is 26 and since it is 26 what it will do is it will start executing all the cases from here onwards but wait what happens is the moment it goes into the switch case of 26 value so the moment we have case 26 what happens is it will print Ur 26 and it will encounter a break statement now in order to explain what this break statement will do let me comment all these break statements off so I'll comment them and um you'll see what they were doing so the moment I run this program now you'll see you are 26 you are 27 28 everything is being printed so all the cases from here onwards are being printed so this code is executed it will not even check the condition because we have already matched the condition so all the cases starting from case 26 will get executed so you are seeing case 27 you are seeing case 28 everything is being executed but I want to stop on case 26 I want to execute just this code the code which is inside case 26 how do I achieve that and how do I achieve that all I need to do to achieve this is I simply write a break statement so I'll uncommon these break statements so these break statements will ensure that the moment I encounter any case further cases will not be executed only the case which is matched will be executed in this case only case 26 will be executed because what this break statement will do is it will throw the control out of the switch case statement so break simply control throws the control out of this particular statement which is uh switch case statement so we'll talk about break and another keyword which is continue in later chapter and there you will understand even more on break and continue but for now let's keep it this way okay so coming back to the notes s case is used when we have to make a choice between number of alternatives for a given variable we simply say switch and we have an integer expression and we can start you know our cases and the moment a case is matched all the code below the cases executed and I have written all these things in the notes as well the value of integer expression is matched against these values if it matches any of these cases that case along with all the subsequent case and default statements are executed even the default statement is executed okay this is something that you need to keep in your mind so what happens is let us say the age is 36 okay um let me add a print F statement after default and show you I'll say no case mashed okay and the moment I run this program now because age is 36 and it is not going to match any of the cases what will happen is it will simply run the default uh statement so so none of the cases matched so it has no other option than to run the default statement so the default statement simply gets executed when none of the cases match but if any one of the cases are matching what happens is all the subsequent cases will run but since we since here we are using a break statement break statement will uh throw the control out of the switch case statement okay I hope this is clear for you uh the value of integer expression is matched against this and you know we already talked about this that all the subse in case and default statements are executed a quick quiz for you write a program to find grade of a student given his marks based on below criteria so we have this criteria if uh if the marks lies between 90 to 100 you need to tell that the grade is a if if the lie between 80 to 90 you need to say the grade is B otherwise C otherwise D so make sure that you solve this problem and you can use f statements to solve this problem okay so this is going to be very simple problem for you if you have have listened to me very carefully on F statements now some important notes on F statements and switch case statements we can use switch case statements even by writing cases in any order of a choice so it is not necessary that you have to uh write your cases in increasing order 24 will come before 25 no you can write cases in any order and whenever you write cases they will simply get matched with the number you are running switch on in this case that particular variable was age so whatever the value of AG is will be matched with all these cases okay so I hope that you understood this next important note is that character values are allowed as they can be easily evaluated to an integer so character values can be easily evaluated to an integer character values are nothing but integer Expressions because every character has a value associated with it and do not get confused with this statement but character values are allowed which means you can always do something like this if you want to match characters you can do something like this and that's absolutely fine um we'll see some questions later on how we can use characters inside switch case now a switch can occur within another but in practice this is really done so you can have a switch inside of switch whenever you have a switch case and you have some code inside a case that is simply a c code you can either have if else statements inside that case so let me give you an example let us say we have case 27 now that you are executing this particular line can you write another switch here yes you can you can start another switch statement here but in practice this is really done you can even have AFL statements inside a case but again that is also rarely done so I hope you understood all these things and uh you were able to find out how you can actually uh use switch case statements and conditional expressions in general so we now move on to chapter number three practice where we are going to look into some questions on switch case statements and and uh then we'll start moving towards some other lectures on C let's move on to chapter 3 practice set now so here is the chapter number three practice set which I've created for all of you and let's now start coding some of the problems so that we have some solid understanding of the conditional Expressions how do we uh start solving these problems I'll show you all the techniques let's start with the problem number one I'll simply name it pr01 doc I'll include the boiler plate code I'll uh you know close this terminal just to get some space and let's read the question it says what will be the output of this program so we have a is equal to 10 the value of a is 10 then we have a is equal to 11 if a is equal to 11 print F I am 11 else I am not 11 if you do not look at this question carefully what you'll end up doing is you'll say a is equal to 10 it's not equal to 11 so this is false if a is equal to 11 I am 11 but a is 10 so I am not 11 will be printed on the the screen but you will be wrong and I just want to type this program real quick and I'll show you why and I'll explain you why but let me type this program real quick and then from there we'll see why the answer is wrong uh print F uh a is 11 and and once again I'll say a 10 here uh else a 10 so let me replicate it and and I'll uh change it to else and once I do else I'll say a 10 but if I run this program I'll show you what guess what it prints a 11 but a 10 why is it printing a 11 and I told you initially that the answer is wrong why why is it wrong so I'll wait for some of you to comment down below why this answer is and I want your comments guys just put the time stamp and drop a comment and I want you to tell me why this answer or rather why this program is behaving in this manner all right I hope few people commented and if you told me that uh AAL to 11 in AAL to 11 equals to is an assignment operator and this entire thing will return a non-zero value you were right this entire thing is going to return a non-zero value when you assign something to something then this is not a Boolean expression this this is a non-zero value and since this is a non-zero value this is true in the eyes of C programming or rather in the eyes of C compiler so this is the reason why this is printed so I hope you understood this problem number one let's now move towards problem number two write a program to find out whether a student is pass or fail if it requires total 40% and at least 30% in each subject to pass so at least 33% is required and a total of 40% is required in each subject to pass assume three subjects and take marks as an input from the user so you have to take marks as an input from the user okay so let's write this program and what we'll do is simply write a file we'll say 08 which is the eth program of this chapter underscore PR 02 Doc and why am I wasting writing these programs in such an organized way just so that you can come back to these programs and start revising while you are watching the video I can always name these programs in some gibberish manner uh you know but I don't want to do that because when you are watching this course you might want to come back to the programs that I'm writing and this pattern or rather this structure of naming the program is going to be very useful for you okay coming back to the question I have to take marks as an input from the user so what I'll do is I'll say int marks and I'll say Marx equals to scanf what is it it's it's an integer so percentage D and M percent marks okay and I don't have to do something like this just plain and simple scanf function will take care of everything so we have this scanf which will take marks as an input from the user and after the marks are taken as an input from the user marks will be stored inside this integer variable because I have mentioned percentage D here okay I hope it's clear so far so we have a Marx variable which is an integer now I have to check whether a student is pass of or not so it requires total 40% and at least 33% in each subject so we have to assume three subjects so what I'll do is I'll simply say Marks One marks 2 and marks 3 so these are three subjects you can even say physics chemistry mathematics or or uh you can say Commerce economics accounts just assume your subjects guys um and do the same thing so just to facilitate the input taking from the user what I'll do is I'll say print F enter Marks One okay enter your marks in the first subject and I'm going to use back sln just to you know uh just to make sure that uh these things are very nicely organized and I'll repeat it for Marx 2 I'll use alt and click to use multiple cursors of vs code uh I'll simply use alt and click here again so when I hold alt and start clicking I keep on getting the cursors and this is how you use multic cursor functionality of vs code so this is a great feature in vs code and I love this feature to be honest now if I run this program and uh I have a habit of checking my program uh add different Milestones just to be sure that I'm writing correct code so 34 34 54 the program works nice so far let's move ahead and start writing the logic so what I'll do is I'll simply say in total is equal to so the total marks will be Marx 1 plus Marx 2 plus Marx 3 just see how I'm writing M3 and I'm getting marks three so it's picking M from here and three from here even if I say mkss it will pick up all the variables which contain this MK and S and if I if I type three then this is the only variable which has MKS s and three so you can use this type of technique to you know write your code faster so we have this total so assume three subjects and take marks as an input from the user but here's a catch we need at least 33% in each subject and total of 40% so let's check the total and since this is percentage I'm going to use float why am I using float because I'm going to divide this by three I'm I'm going to take average of these three marks and if I use integer I might lose Precision I don't want that okay uh oops I need to write three because these are three values and also what I'll do is I'll check this I'll sa if total is greater than or equal to 40 you are pass okay but if it's not greater than equal to 40 what I'll do is I'll say print F sorry you are are not passed because your marks are less than 40% okay less than 40% okay so if your total is greater than or equal to 40% I need to check your individual marks so what I'll do is if Max 1 is less than 33 or or so I'll use this pipe Max 2 is less than 33 or I'll once again use the pipe so what I'll do is is I'll say Marx 3 is less than 33 if this happens what I'll do is I'll simply say print F you are not pass you are not pass because uh your marks in one of these subjects uh is less than 33 Okay so this is something that you can write and yes that's fine okay now what I'll do is if this is not the case I'll simply say X else if this is not the case simply say congratulations you are you have passed the exam okay so once I do this I can run this program once again and let me you know award myself 23 marks in one of the subjects and 55 in the other 88 in the other and I have not passed because my marks in one of the subjects is less than 33 okay uh so this is how this program works I once again use arrow keys and press enter and uh in fact I use the up Arrow key and you can do that you know click on the terminal use up Arrow key press enter and your program will fire up once again okay so max one is 67 Marx 2 45 and let me say 35 so yes I have passed the exam because my marks in all three subjects are greater than 33 and the total aggregate is also greater than 40 okay now let's run it once again so what I'll do is I'll simply award myself 34 marks 34 34 and 34 so what this will do is this will uh end up awarding me 34 marks in total which is 34% in total and since this is less than 40 I'm going to fail okay so you are not passed because your marks are less than 40% okay did you notice one thing that we typed this percent and we were not able to see this percent inside the uh console why was that uh so what I'll do is I'll type double percentage and when you say double percentage it is actually printed as a single percentage let me show you I'll save this program this program and I'll uh simply run this program once again now what I'll do is I'll simply award myself 35 marks in all these three subjects and you can see that this percentage has been printed so when you say percentage it will assume that you are going to type something like percentage D percentage f F or percentage U LD or something but but if you type percentage percentage printf will get the signal that you are going to type or you want percent literally to be displayed here like this so if you want to have percentage displayed literally on the screen simply type percentage percentage and um that will solve the problem okay that will do the trick for you so we solved question number two we solved question number one let's move on to question number three now and it says calculate income tax paid by an employee to the government as for the slps mentioned below so income slab rates are these and tax is this note that there is no tax below 2.5 lakhs take income amount as an input from the user simply take the income amount from the uh user and you can write some logic to calculate the text so let's let's solve this problem this is an interesting problem so what we will do is simply create a new file 09 uncore pr03 Doc and we'll simply add some boilerplate code we'll simply say and you know what I'm going to do I'm going to copy the print and scanf from here and I'm going to create a variable tax and income okay so let's assume that the income is um an integer and uh we'll see if you want to make tax as float so let's make tax as float and let's keep on adding to text if the income is um you know greater than 2.5 so if the income is please enter um enter your income okay so so the user will enter the income if income is less than 2.5 lakhs or rather 25 this is 2.5 lakhs if this is the case your income is less than or equal to or let's keep it less than uh 2.5 lakhs so no TX for you okay so uh since the tax from 2.5 lakhs to 5 lakhs is 5% what we'll do is uh we'll simply add zero to the tax if this is the case now what we'll do is if the income lies between 2.5 and five what we'll do is We'll add that particular amount of tax to the user's income okay so what I'll do is I'll now type LF and inside the if what I'll write is I'll say if income is less than 7.5 lakh and it's greater than income is greater than 2.5 lakhs now what will happen if I do this so I hope I have put down the zeros correctly yes I have 4 + 1 5 4 + 1 5 yes just make sure that you are typing the number of zeros correctly okay so what I'll do now is I will simply say your income is your income is between 2.5 lakhs and 7.5 lakhs so that's it we are not going to say no text for you now what we'll do is we'll see uh or rather it was five laks my bad so I'll have to say five here five LHS and also five ha here okay so if this is the case we'll do something okay now if this is the case where the user income is uh greater than five and it is less than uh say 10 lakhs okay so if it's less than 10 lakhs uh 3 + 1 4 + 1 5 3 + 1 4 + 1 5 so if it lies between 5 lakhs and 10 lakhs what we'll do is we'll charge 20% of the Tex okay on this income otherwise what we'll do is if the income is greater than 10 lakhs what we'll do is we'll charge the base amount and then we'll add 30% of tax to the remaining of the income okay so if this sounds confusing simply take a piece of pen and paper and start writing whatever I'm seeing start calculating use a calculator and things will start making sense to you so I'll simply say your income is above an LX here now let's add to the text so when the income is between 5 lakhs plus 2.5 lakhs what we'll do is we'll simply add something to the tax so we'll say tax equals to Tax Plus We'll add a value to the Tex and this is how you add value to a variable so let us say the text was zero and I add five to it so I'll simply say text is equal to Tex + 5 and text will now become five because I have added five to the text but how much will I add to the text I'll simply add um 20% or rather 5% of the Tex so since the income is between 2.5 and 5 I'll simply add 5% of the tax so what I'll do is I'll simply say 0.05 multiply by uh what is what is the income income between 5 lakhs and 2.5 lakhs I'll simply say income minus 2.5 lakhs why did I do that because I want to charge tax only on the income which is above 2.5 lakhs so if you are earning 3 lakhs I'll charge income tax on 50,000 because till 2.5 lakhs there is no tax and after 2.5 lakhs we have 5% of tax okay so this is how we calculate tax now if the income is between 5 lakhs and 10 lakhs what will happen is I'll simply use um how much 10% um yes no 20% so I'll simply say 0.02 this time so I'll say 0 uh 0.2 which is 20% and I'll multiply this by income minus 5 lakhs so whatever you are earning above 5 lakhs I'm going to charge your income tax on that okay but I also need to charge you income tax on um you know your income between 2.5 and 5 lakhs so I'll add another taex for you uh let me let me do it this way so I'll I'll charge this much as well so on your income between 5 and 2.5 I'm going to charge you 0.05 okay so between 2.5 and 5 lakhs whatever you are earning I'm going to charge 5% and between 5 lakhs to whatever you are earning because your income is between 5 lakh to 10 lakh I'm going to charge 20% on that and when when you are earning above 10 lakhs what I'll do is I'll simply I'll simply say 0 um 05 on this 0.2 on this and 0.3 on the remaining of the income between 10 lakhs and above uh and what I'll need to do is between your income between 10 lakhs uh sorry between 5 lakhs and 10 lakhs I need to charge 20% so this is going to be the total TX let's see what is the total TX so I'll simply say total tax to be paid is percentage F and I'll simply say Tex and I'll press uh I'll simply press the semic column enter your income 10 lakhs rather 11 lakhs if I enter 11 lakhs you need to pay this much in Tex so three uh to five so you need to pay 1 lak 142,000 in taxes okay now if your income is 23,000 rupes you need to pay zero tax okay now if your income is 250,000 you need to pay some tax your income is above okay so I actually used an additional zero 3 + 2 5 I actually entered 25 lakhs I should have entered one zero less but again if your income is 25 lakhs this is the amount of tax you need to pay you need to pay around 6 lakhs in taxes okay so if I enter my income as 2 lakh 4,000 this is my income tax and if my income tax is 251,000 you can see that the tax to be paid is 50 rupees which is 5% of 100 rupees uh sorry not 100 rupees 1,000 rupees 5% of 1,000 rupees is 50 rupees yes that's right okay so I hope you understood and I hope that this problem solved a lot of your existing doubts on variables on data types on conditional expression and if this program sounds haunting to you watch the video once again uh you know just skip to uh where we started this question and start practicing this program yourself okay and things will start making sense to you so this is how you calculate income text once again do not take this as you know the accurate information this is assumed information I'm giving you a disclaimer Google for the tax rates in your country and you know do not use this to calculate your tax I know nobody will do that but again it's my duty to give the disclaimer now write a program to find whether a year entered by the user is a leap year or not take year as an input from the user so in order to find out whether a given year is Leap Year or not you simply go to Google and simply say what is a leap year okay and you'll get the conditions a year occurring once every four years which has 366 days including 29th February as an inter calerie day so if you go into detail and if you go to Wikipedia of leaper there are some of the uh you know they have in fact written the algorithm okay so I'm going I'm not going to you know look into this algorithm rather I want you to build the algorithm yourself okay and you can always look into the algorithm and if you type that you are going to write the program accurately but what I want you to do is just think about what a leapia is and then once you have an idea of what Lear is then start coding and then you'll feel very confident after you write the program having said that what I'll do is I'll simply copy this algorithm uh I just told you that you need to understand the algorithm understand the process behind the algorithm and then start writing the logic but just for the sake of saving some time what I'll do is I'll simply copy this logic and I'll start coding problem number four which is uh program number 10 pr04 Doc and when you do something like this and you you know paste it you're going to get a lot of Errors we need to fix these errors it says ear is not divisible by four how do you say this in C you simply say year percent 4 is not equals to zero is not equals to Z you can always say this and let me say in year is equal to 3444 and I'll simply print F and say it is a common year and uh you know in place of then what I'll do is I'll add these parenthesis okay and I'll simply say print f and I'll add double quates I'll select this add the double quat and and I'll do the same for these as well so let me do one thing let me start using multic cursor functionality of vs code I'll simply say print F and I'll simply shift this I'll add this I'll press end on the keyboard I'll use arrow keys once again I'll close this I'll add the semicolon I'll uh close it like this okay now I'll do the same thing for this I'll simply say if year per 100 is not equals to zero if year is not divisible by 100 okay here is not divisible by 100 and if here is not divisible by 400 I'll do the same thing divisible by 400 okay and once again what I'll do is else it is a leap here so I'll simply copy this thing again and it is a leap here semicolon curly braces closed and you don't have to you know do like this you can keep it this way and this program will work just fine but again it's a good practice to make your program look good with the indents let me add these indents to the program print F uh Missing closing code am I making okay I'm making this mistake I'm not adding the closing code uh I think everything is fine now and let me cross check the logic the logic says that if here is not divisible by 4 not divisible by 100 not divisible by 400 then finally it will be leap here okay so if it is not divisible by 100 and it is divisible by 4 it will be a leap here so this is a logic so how this works let me explain it to you and what I'll do is I'll uh add another endend just you know so that this looks good you can always say format document it will format it in a good way for you so how is this logic working so we have divisible uh sorry not divisible not divisible not divisible and uh let me call it not equals to zero okay yeah cool so it is a common year I've written the logic correctly if the year is 3444 it will check whether it is divisible by four or not if not it is a common year it has to be divisible by four to be a leap here but there are some other conditions which should be met for this year to be a leap year so what we'll do is we'll check for all those conditions we'll say is it divisible by 100 or not if it is not divisible by 100 yes it is a leap year is it divisible by 400 or not if it is not divisible by 400 then it is a common year but if none of these conditions are actually getting true then it is a leap here okay so what happens is if it it is divisible by four which means this is false this is false this is false then finally it will be a leap here okay just think about it and start relating your program with the actual logic of things so you should have the logic of leapia ready and then once you have the logic of leapia ready you write the program and then it will start making sense to you so one of these if else if else if else will be executed just look at this program in this way and it will be super simple moving on towards the next problem and the next problem is really very simple and straightforward it says write a program to determin whether a character entered by the user is lowercase or not so let me tell you something whenever you write a character in C language uh let me show you something I'll simply type character s key value in C okay um what I'll do is I'll simply use this s key table and what this Sky table is let's try to understand this first and then we'll solve the question so Sky table is nothing but some values which are mapped to the characters so let me show you something okay and once you have uh you know a good understanding of that then you'll be able to solve this question so let me create 11th program and it's pr0 5.c if I'm not wrong it's problem number five if I'm not wrong yes so let me show you something let me put this boiler plate code and let me show you something what if I say uh something like this I'll I'll say the value is I'll say percentage D and I'll simply say a character a which is a now listen to me very carefully if I run this program this is not an integer by the way let me tell you this is a character but if I hover over it you'll see that it is an INT with a value 97 let me run this program for you and show you that it indeed prints 97 so a character is stored as an integer in C in the form of SK Sky value and if I say a percentage C then I'll be able to see a but if I do percentage D then the S key value of this particular thing is 97 which is being printed so whenever you are writing this literal whenever you write this character literally what it means is it means that it is an integer with the SK value so you can perform addition subtraction multiplication and division with all these values okay let me show you how so uh now we have a program to determine whether a character uh entered by the user is lower case or not as the question so this is the question we have to solve this question so let's look at the SK table and let's see where ABCD is you know uh being started from it's it's being started from 65 and it's going all the way till 90 or rather 90 okay not even 96 so if a character is lowercase it has to lie between 97 to 122 so that's all that's the check I'll say enter your character so let me say car c I'll say print F enter your character and and definitely back slash in okay and once I do that I'll use scanf and I'll say percentage C note that it's not percentage D you need percentage C and am percent of C where C is the character let me change it to car so that you don't um character let me change it to character so that you have a good idea of which one is variable and which one is format specifier so we have this as uh a print statement and then we are taking characteriz the input from the user and the moment we do that what will happen is we are going to check whether this particular character is greater than or equal to what is greater than equal to 97 and also we need to check if this character is less than or equal to what 128 if I'm not wrong 122 yes I'm wrong 22 you don't have to remember this you might think that I don't even remember SK SK table I don't have to remember SK SK table and and you also don't even have to remember SK table Some people prefer to remember and even some schools and colleges they say that you know remember the U ask value of 65 and the value 90 and you know you add 32 and you get this particular value and this particular value respectively so if you add 32 um you know to 65 you'll get this so whenever you have to convert a character from from uppercase to lower casee you simply add 32 to the value and you know you get the character which is lower uh lowercase version of the uppercase character so you can do all those things but I don't I don't think that you have to remember anything uh if you remember 65 well and good for you you can um easily come to 90 if you have 65 and also you can easily come to um this thing uh 98 and you can easily uh sorry 97 and you can easily uh come to 122 by counting from a to zed so if you remember 65 and 32 just remember these two numbers if you add 32 to 65 you'll get this and if you add uh you know if you start counting from a b c d all the way till Zed you can come here and similarly you can come uh to this value if you start counting from 97 okay but coming back to the question we have to check whether a character is greater than equal to 97 and less than equal to 122 I'll say print F yes this is a lower case character and otherwise what what will I do I'll say I'll remove this I'll say no this is not a lowercase character so let me do something like this I'll say no this is not a lowercase character and let me run this for you enter your character five uh no this is not a lowercase character capital A no this is not a lowercase character small a yes this is a lowercase character small D yes it's a lowercase character capital D no this is not a lower case character V lowercase character capital V not a lowercase character and so on you can you know I can keep on going for 3 4 hours but I'll not uh coming back to the question coming back to the practice set question number six write a program to find greatest of four numbers entered by the user and I think this is the easiest problem of the practice it because if you have a little bit of um you know logical mind you can definitely do this this is problem number 6 pr06 doc at the boiler plate code so let me tell you how you can solve this problem how you can find greatest of four numbers entered by the user let us say you have four numbers let us say you have four Fighters you you have four of your friends and they say that I am the strongest person in the room so what you do is you make two people fight and then you make two people fight again they both will fight and the winner of this two and the winner of this two will fight with each other and they will find out who is the strong longest of all so we'll do the similar thing here we'll take four numbers so let me say in A1 is equal to 1 and let me do the same thing for A2 A3 A4 and A4 and let me you know assign some random values to these um variables now what I'll do is I'll say if A1 is greater than A2 okay and uh if A1 is greater than A2 and A1 is greater than A3 and also A1 is greater than A4 who will be the winner A1 will be the winner I'll say A1 is the greatest okay and you can do the same thing for all the values so let me show you how you can do how you can have you know if else if LF lsf okay now if A1 is greater than A2 and A1 is greater than A3 then A1 is the winner and if I do the same thing with A2 A2 A2 A2 and we need to compare A2 with A1 A3 and A4 similarly we need to compare A3 with A1 A2 and a uh A3 with A2 A1 and A4 and then A4 with A4 A4 and here so I need to make it A3 A3 here I checking if A1 is the winner here I'm checking if A2 is the winner here I'm checking if A3 is the winner and here I'm checking if A4 is the winner which is why I have A4 A4 A4 but when I'm checking A4 I need to ensure that I'm making a A4 fight with A1 A3 and A2 okay let's run this program A4 is the greatest what if I make this as 4421 then A3 is the greatest A3 is the greatest what if I make it this and I make it this then A2 is the greatest yes A2 is the greatest what if I make it 3331 then A1 is the greatest yes A1 is the greatest so this is how you can actually find out which which of the numbers is greatest of the four numbers okay I hope you were able to solve the questions in this practice set also I hope that you understood all the concepts which were taught in this chapter now we'll move on to the next chapter where we discuss some more stuff on C programming language let's move on to chapter 4 now let's now look into chapter number four and see what it has to offer so what I'll do is I'll simply open this Loop control instruction chapter in my PDF viewer AKA Google Chrome okay so what I'll do is I'll tell you what Loops are we'll try to understand Loops using some basic analogies and then from there we'll start writing the code so why do we need Loops what if I tell you you have to write a program where you have to print numbers from 1 to 100 uh maybe you might be able to type uh print f 1 print f 2 3 4 5 6 all the way to 100 there is a chance you can do that what if I make it 1 to th000 it is going to be a bit difficult for you but again you can do it what if I make it one to 1,000 uh or rather 10,000 what if I make it 1 to 50,000 okay here's the thing what if I make it from 1 to 1 billion it will be very very dous for you to do that and you might not be able to do that so in that case what we do is when we have something uh which we want to execute repeatedly in a very fashioned way we use loops and how do we use Loops is something that we are going to learn in this chapter so sometimes we want our programs to execute few set of instructions over and over again for example printing from 1 to 100 uh first 100 even numbers Etc hence Loops make it easy for a programmer to tell computer that a given set of instructions must be executed repeatedly so let us say you want to print a number you want to print a number 10 times you can simply say print one print one print one print one print one all the way till 10 times but if I ask you to do it 100 times it will be TDS for you but using Loops you can do it in fewer lines let's see how so what I'll do is I'll simply close this particular thing from my vs code and I'll open this folder in vs code let me open this folder in vs code and um the moment do that what I'll do is simply create a new file and I'll simply say 01 uncore loop. C let me put the boiler plate code and let's learn about what Loops are primarily there are three types of Loops in C language we have a while loop we have a do wi Loop and we have a for Loop let me tell you something from my experience we are going to use while loops and for Loops a lot more than we are going to use do wi Loops now this is this is just something I'm telling you from my experience but again there might be scenarios where you'll use two wi Loops more than violent for Loops but in general and um I can say this for programming in general we use a lot of for Loops then we use fewer v loops and then again we very rarely use two wi Loops again this is going to change that depends upon what you are doing but in most of the scenarios for Loop is the mostly used while loop is second mostly used and do while loop is something that you you're going to use sometimes okay now let's look into these one by one let's look into while loop first what is a while loop and how synex of a v Loop looks like so what we usually do is we create a variable we simply say int I is equal to Z and we start counting from zero because of arrays in arrays the index starts from zero if you don't know what arrays are you don't have to worry because I'm going to talk about arrays in the later chapters but for now keep in mind that whenever you are doing programming start counting from zero instead of counting from one because it is going to make things easier for you so let's make n i is equal to Z and let me write V and the moment I do that you can see that I got a snippet what I'll do is I'll say if I is less than 34 I'll press Tab Key on the keyboard and I'll simply say print F the value of I is percentage D and let me also write a back sln here so that I can see a new line now this is something that you can type as well I mean I I didn't do any magic you can very easily type this thing and typing is going to be a lot more easier if you are U not having Snippets or some other extension if you are coding in some uh source codor which doesn't support these kind of Snippets you can simply type this out and it is really very easy to type this thing out than typing the value of I is 0 1 2 3 4 34 times let's see what this program returns so the moment I run this program you'll see something like this so what happens is it keeps on printing keeps on Printing and I'm in trouble let me tell you why why am I in trouble so I I I had to cancel this and it went on infinitely uh so what I forgot was I forgot to increment the value of I so there are two ways you can use to increment the value of I either you can do something like I ++ or you can do something like I + = to 1 you can also say I is equal to I + 1 and and this is going to have almost the same effect okay so you can use either of these basically what I'm doing is I'm simply running this while loop and inside the while loop I'm updating the variable so there will come a time when the value of I will simply be nothing but more than 34 or it will become 34 at some point and whenever that happens this condition will uh turn out to be false I also forgot to write I here so now we have a program which will definitely work and it will start printing from 0 to 33 so you can see the value of I is 0 2 1 2 3 4 all the way till 33 how does it work let's now try to understand how this syntax is actually giving the result that I am getting so what happens is where as in I is equal to 0 I is initialized to an initial value of zero now when I say while I is less than 34 I'm saying this is a block and you have to keep on executing this block until this is true and inside this block something can happen which can make this condition return false so something can happen inside this block which will make this condition false eventually and if that doesn't happen this is going to be an infinite while loop we don't want that okay in ideal scenarios we don't want that now when I say while I is less than 34 this is a condition and as long as this condition is true this block will will keep on repeating it will keep on repeating so what happens is is I less than 34 yes it is because 0 is less than 34 and the moment I see that this particular expression is evaluated to true what happens is these two lines of instructions are executed so this will get printed the value of I is z so the value of i0 is printed and then the second piece of instruction says that you have to increment the value of I by 1 so if I is Z it will become one if I is 1 it will become two if I is two it will become three and if I is three it is going to become four and so on okay so this is how entire thing is going to work print fs and I ++ and eventually the value of I is going to be 33 and when it is 33 this condition is going to be true again so the value of I is 33 will be printed but during this iteration something special will happen the value of I is going to be 34 and this condition no longer evaluates to true now which is why this y Loop will cease to execute that's it for this while loop that's it because the condition is now evaluating to false as long as the condition is evaluated to true the Y Loop was running but the moment we see that the condition is being evaluated to false this Loop will no longer continue to execute okay which is why this PR will end because we have a return zero here and hence the result hence we are getting this the value of I is 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 eventually I becomes 34 which makes this y Loop to stop because now the value of I is 34 and the condition inside this y Loop is going to be false okay so I hope that you understood all these things and now what I'm going to do is I'm going to move ahead and show you the syntax which have written in the notes and why do we have these notes at the first place because I want you to come come back to these notes after 6 months and you're going to have everything back in your mind because you have refreshed all the concepts which you were um already aware of now you have these notes and you can simply come back to these notes and start revising whatever topics you like okay so make sure that you download these notes and make sure that you have a printed copy of this notes and no I don't have any tie apps from the zerox shop in your country okay you can go to your nearest Xerox shop and you know get these documents printed and it is going to be really very useful but if you are a Kindle guy or you are a an iPad guy or you know some tab guy you might even use the PDF okay let's see what I've written in the notes I've written the basics index which is while and the condition and then you can uh you have multiple lines of codes inside the block and all these lines will keep on executing until this condition is true so the block keeps executing as long as the condition is true eventually the condition should become calls for this while loop to Halt or else you should have a continue or break statement inside your V we will see how continue and break works but again an example of while loop has been written here the value of I is I've shown you this example and this is the same example that I've shown you so you can play around with this code and you know start changing the number start changing the initial value of I start changing the condition you can make this 10 instead of 34 you have this code I'm going to zip all this and I'm going to send it to you so you don't have to worry about that I've written a note here if the condition never becomes false the V Loop keeps getting executed such a loop is known as an infinite Loop so I haven't shown you the infinite Loop yet if I don't have this condition the value of I is going to be zero always and this thing is going to be printed on the console always let me show you so if I run this program the value of I is zero will keep on printing will keep on printing until I press contrl C to hold this program so I'll have to manually hold this program or hold vs code or this terminal to stop this program okay I can either press contrl C I can either click here or I can even close the vs code on my computer Al together which will um you know stop this program but again um we want our program to stop eventually because we want to accomplish something from our program in ideal scenarios there are some cases where we use intentional infinite while Loops what are those scenarios let me tell you um about few scenarios there are few scenarios where we want our program to keep running and you know keep checking something in regular intervals so if you want that you can have a while one and inside that you can keep on checking something for some time you know you can wait for half an hour and check something then again wait for half an hour and check something one of the example is whether a stock price has hit a value or not let us say you are tracking the index of your stock market and you you want to see if your index is down by 10% or not so you might want to keep checking that every half an hour so you can write a v one Loop which keeps on checking for the time and the moment time becomes a multiple of rather the minutes becomes the multiple of 30 so every half an hour you are checking whether your index has hit a particular value or not but in most of the cases we want to avoid infinite loops and uh in most of the cases for beginners in finite Loops are a result of mistake in the coding logic okay we don't want that let us come to the quick quiz which I written for you it says write a program to print natural numbers from 10 to 20 when initial Loop counter is initialized to zero now the initial Loop counter is initialized to zero which means I will have to keep this I is equal to zero if that was not the case I would have simply change this value as 10 and this value as 21 and that should have done the trick but no the initial value has to be zero how do I solve this problem now so let me write another piece of code for you I'll simply say quick uncore quiz do c okay so let me paste this and also let me keep this 34 I'm going to play around with this so the value of I is zero and what I'll do is I'll keep on going till 20 from 0 to 20 but I'll have if statement here and inside the if statement I'll simply say if I is greater than or equal to 10 then only you are doing that then only you are printing this otherwise you are not printing this okay so if I do that for I is equal to Z this line will not be executed for I is equal to 1 this line will not be executed for 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 this will not be executed in the moment I have the value of i as 10 this will be executed so I'll get the value of I is 10 all the way till 20 let me show you so run this program you can see the value of I is 10 11 12 13 14 15 all the way till 20 so this is how this uh while loop works okay coming back to the notes uh we have solved the quick quiz the loop counter need not be in it can be a float as well so this is something that you need to keep in your mind Loop C cter can be a float it can be a double it can be anything okay you you don't have to keep it as an integer but in most of the cases we keep it as an integer so that we can count uh conveniently okay now let's talk about increment and decrement operators what are these operators and why do we need to use these and this is something which is asked a lot in C programming interviews and even if you are uh studying C programming language at school or in your college this is going to be asked for sure okay I ++ what does it mean it simply means that increase the value of I by 1 so if I was 4 make it five if I was 9 make it 10 if I was 22 make it 23 iusus yes you guessed it right IUS minus means that decrease the value of I by 1 so if I was 54 make it 53 if it was 128 make it 127 and so on but we have another decrement operator which we use like this minus- I instead of doing i-- we do minus- I and how does it work it basically decrements the value of I first and then it prints the value of I when kept inside print F so let me explain this to you how this works uh so in order to explain this let me come to my vs code I'll write a program 3 and let me call it increment do c I'm going to say boiler plate codes so that I can put the C language boiler plate code here I'll simply say print F and then I'll say i++ okay let me show you what it prints if the initial value of I is say 9 okay if the value of I is 9 and if I do I ++ what I'm going to get is I'm going to get uh oops I need to um I made a mistake I need to say percentage d i ++ instead of literally printing I ++ my bad let me run it again and you'll see that the value of I is 9 so even if I do I ++ why am I getting nine why why don't I get 10 let me try this once again let me try to print the value of I after I do this I ++ the value is 910 what is going on why is it 91 0 it's in fact not 91 0 um I'm not using back sln let me use back sln then you going to understand what is happening so this line prints n this line prints 10 so how does this work how does this increment operator works if I have a value of I which is 9 and I say I ++ and I have a print F wrapped around it what will happen is the value will be printed first and then it will get incremented so nine is printed but post printing of nine what happens is that the value of I now becomes 10 because we have I ++ here so what happens is after this is executed the value of I is 10 so if I say I print f i I'm going to get 10 so I ++ means first print the value of I what was the value of I 9 so first print 9 and then increment the value of I and what does Plus+ I do let me change this to Plus+ I now Plus+ I means first increment the value Val of I and after you have done incrementing the value of I you print the value of I so what will get printed 10 will get printed and what will get printed for this statement 10 will get printed because the value of I is nine we first incremented it and then we printed it so this will print 10 as the value of I because the value of I is 10 because I have incremented it from 9 to 10 so first incrementation takes place which makes the value of is 10 then printing takes place is so this is how it works so let's see if it prints 10 and 10 oh yes it does prints 10 and 10 so this prints 10 because I'm first incrementing the value of I and then I'm printing the value of I which is 10 and this also prints 10 because I'm printing the value of I which is 10 I hope you understood how this works so coming back to the notes increment and decrement operators I ++ means I is increased by one i-- means I is decreased by one when I do something like print f minus- i uh and then percentage D and if I try to print minus- I what will be printed first I will be decremented then I will be printed now first uh this first decrements I and then prints it so minus- I means first decrement the value of I then print it iusus means first print the value of I and then decrement it I hope you understood this try to run as many programs as possible to understand this concept initialize I with a value try to print i++ try to print Plus+ I this will not cost you anything you have your laptop just write the program Open VSS code and start writing code now this first decrements I and then prints it and this prints I and then it decrements it so I've written this very clearly triple plus operator does not exist make sure that you are not using um i++ plus Plus+ plus and you expect it to increment I four five six times no that doesn't happen we just have this Plus+ operator now there is something called plus equals to as well is it's called compound assignment Operator just like we have plus equals to we also have minus equals to times equals to divide equals to and um percent equal to okay and this is also important you need to practice these operators as well okay so these were some of the increment and decrement operators uh you need to understand uh now we'll talk about the dowi loop and we'll write some program doy Loop is very very similar to while loop so you going to understand it very very easily so let's now talk about do while Loops the syntax of do while loop looks like this so we have a do we have some code then we have while then we have some condition but how does it all work let me tell you so what I'll do is I'll show you a code snippet of dowi Loop and then I'll explain you how all these things are working together so what we do is we write a do we start a parenthesis and we start writing the code and at the end we write a V and then a condition inside that so do while loop works very similar to while loop while checks the condition and then executes the code do while loop first executes the code and then checks the condition let's see how these two kinds of Loops are different from each other so what I'll do is I'll simply start uh writing a do while loop so I'll simply say do while. c and the moment I do that and I add a boiler plate code firstly what I'll do is I'll show you a v Loop and what I'll do is and then I'll convert the same V to do V and show you how these Loops are different from each other so if I have a v Loop and if I have in I is equal to 7 and if I do something like this I'll say the value of I is percentage D and I now here clearly I is not less than five so this Loop is never going to execute so whatever I write here this is never going to execute because this condition is never going to be true now if I run this program and uh I think I'm making some mistake actually I selected the code and ran it you don't have to select the code and run it you simply run it and it is going to work so this Loop didn't get executed at all why was that the case that was the case because I is not less than five I is 7 and 7 is greater than five but what if we have a dowi loop let me convert this to a dowi loop syntax so what I will do is in dowi Loop we have a block first and while is at the end so I'll have to bring this while at the end and I'll have to write do here so this is the syntax of a do while loop and also we need to keep a semicolon here so this is very very important in case of dowi Loops whenever you are converting a while loop to a dowi loop make sure you add a semicolon here okay now what I'll do is save it and run it and to your surprise you'll see the value of is7 being printed on the console you might think that why is this the case when the condition is not at all true so if you look at the structure of dowi loop uh you can you know kind of I'm giving you an analogy to understand how dowi Loop works the control will come here it will start executing this it will not see the condition yet it will run this Loop once for sure no matter what the condition is it might be true it might be false but the moment it checks for the condition it will rerun the loop only if the condition is true and if the condition is not true it's not going to rerun anything it's not going to do anything okay so this is how uh a do while loop works and uh let me come back to the notes and show you how this thing works so the syntax of do while Loops look like this do code code while and then condition do while loop works very similar to while loop while loop checks the condition and then executes the code do while executes the code and then checks the conditions so dowi Loop is a v Loop which is executed at least once okay so this is something that you need to remember whenever you have a dowi loop it has to be executed at at least once by the compiler okay so this no matter what will be executed at least once will it be executed again depends upon the condition as long as the condition is true it will be executed so you can look at dowi Loops as a while loop which is executed at least once for sure will it be executed for the second time maybe maybe not depends upon the condition uh I'll show you something so if I run this program you'll see that the value of y 7 is printed and this Loop never repeats itself again now what if I make it one so that the condition is true and also I'll keep on incrementing I inside the loop what this will do is this will actually make the value of i as two in the second iteration three in the third iteration and so on so for the first time this F Loop executes for sure and the value of I will become two so the value of I will be two and it will keep on incrementing and the D y Loop will keep on executing let me show you if I run this code the value of I is 1 the value of I is 2 3 4 and the moment the value becomes five you'll have to Halt the V Loop because the condition is no longer true so the doy Loop will stop because the condition will be false and it will jump out of this block and start executing the instructions here okay so this is how a do while loop works I hope you got the hang of how this thing is is working and here's a quick quiz for you write a program to print first and natural numbers using doy Loop so if the input is four what you have to do is you have to uh write a program such that 1 2 3 4 is printed like this can you solve this can you write a program for me I want you to write this program give me the time stamp of the video wherever you are writing the program and write a comment below that way you will practice I want you to comment and I want you to accept the challenge right challenge accepted in the comments at least and just solve this problem I mean if you solve this problem then only you'll be able to understand the concepts but if you keep on watching the video I don't think that it is sufficient to understand and get hang off do while Loops just write one program at least and make sure you access these notes I'm uh saying it once I'll say it again I'll say it 10 times let's look into for Loop now here is a syntax of for Loop and whenever we talk about a loop it's nothing but repetition of instructions we have an instruction we repeat it based on a condition which means we check the condition and we repeat if the condition is true then once again we do the same thing and we keep on doing that until the condition is true the moment it becomes false that's it the loop will terminate okay so the syntax of for Loop looks like this for initialize test and increment or decrement and then there is some code inside let me explain this to you this might sound very haunting to you if you are a beginner inside a for Loop we have a initialized block a semicolon then a test block a semicolon then some line of code which will increment or decrement our variable which we initialized here so let me show you how this works okay and uh once I show you the example it'll be easy for you to understand how for Loop works so I'll simply say for. c i WR a boiler plate code let me start typing for for and the moment I start typing for I should get some snippet so if I say for you can see that code snippet for for Loop once I click this I can change this to in I can press tab I'll keep it as I I'll make it seven once again I'll press the Tab Key and I can write some code here in case you are not able to get this snippet you can type this out you can type this line this line and this line out sometimes you might not get the snippet sometimes the extension might not work you might be on a slower computer there are a number of things which can happen do not stop I have uh seen a lot of students stopping just because they're not getting this Sni suggestion that's that's not good okay now for in I is equal to 0 I is less than 7 I ++ let's print the value of I let's do the simplest task we can do with I and we can say the value of I is I'll simply say percentage D and what I'll do is I'll print the value of I also I want to print a back such that uh you'll be able to see uh a new line after the value of I is 0 1 2 3 4 is being printed if I run this program let me run this program and show you the output I starts from zero and stops at 6 how does this Loop work let me show you so whenever you have this for Loop this initialized part is executed just once so in I is equal to 0 will be executed once then what happens is it will check for this condition if this particular thing evaluates to true then only it will move ahead if it doesn't evaluate to true it doesn't move ahead okay so is I less than seven yes it is it will move ahead okay and it will execute this so the value of I is zero will be printed as we can see here now what happens is listen to me very very carefully because this is important and once you understand how for loops work it'll be easy for you believe me so print F the value of I is percentage D and once this line is executed what happens is this particular update piece of code runs and what it does is it will simply increment the value of I by 1 so if I was Zero before it will become one now what will happen is it will check this condition again and then it will print the value of I if the condition is true if the condition is false it will jump out of the for Loop and it will stop the loop okay so I'm starting over I'm telling you once again about the fall Loop in case you didn't listen to to me carefully in I is equal to 0 will be executed once so the value of I will be zero initially and then what will happen is this condition will be checked is it true yes it is true this code will be executed once this code is executed this will run I ++ the value of I will become one condition will be checked 1 is less than 7even yes this is executed yes the value of I is 1 and this keeps on happening until the value of I gets to six now once the value of I becomes six what will happen is this will run and the value of I will now become seven is 7 less than 7 no this condition is false 7 is not less than seven since this condition is false what will happen is this for Loop will be stopped we'll come out of this for Loop and the moment we come out of this for Loop the instructions after the for Loop will be executed I hope you understood how for Loop works we can come back to the notes and we can see the synex of for Loop looks like this for initialized test increment or decrement and then the code runs it might be more than one line of code in this example I have just a single line of code it can be three lines it can be four lines it can be 10 lines it depends okay you can add as many lines as you want so coming back to the nodes initialize test increment I've explained a bit about what initialize is what test is and what increment is in most of the cases initialize will be setting a loop counter to an initial value test is checking for a condition increment is updating the loop counter and here is an example so I've done the same thing I I mistakenly written % I then I scribbled it off so if I is equal to 0 I is less than 3 i ++ 0 1 and two will be printed so you might want to remember this I mean when I say remember this uh I don't want you to mug up the code and the output but you should at least understand that this for Loop will print value is starting from 0 to 6 because here I is less than 7 and I ++ but let me tell you one thing in some cases your examiner might change these values to something that will produce an output different from the output you might expect okay so do not mug up the output look at the follow Loop very very carefully when you solving a problem but if you are looking at this Loop which is a very simple Loop yes it will print from 0 to 6 but if I change the condition do something like this say I I I make it I minus minus then then the things are going to change then you'll have to do the dry run you'll have to see what the value of y you'll have to execute all these things one by one so you will initialize first check for the condition execute this thing if the condition is true execute this thing then check the condition then execute this thing if the condition is true then you run this then again check the condition if the condition is true you run this and you keep on going until this condition becomes false until this condition becomes false okay I hope you understood the fall Loop now I hope that I was able to explain you how fall Loop works okay the output of this program is self-explanatory now we have written a code and also I made things easier for you by writing all these things in the notes I have written the meanings of initialize test and increment and I hope that uh you are going to love for Loops this is something that you're going to use a lot when it comes to programming let's solve a quick quiz now right a program to print first and natural numbers using for Loop we have already written that but again I want you to use scan a function take the value of n from the user and write the program also make sure you drop me a comment below with the time stamp and tell me that you have solved this problem were you able to solve this problem I want a yes comment from all of you that will really be very satisfying for me if I have a yes comment from all of you saying that yes we were able to solve this quick quiz I can't tell you how good I feel when you guys comment and tell me that you were able to do something just make sure you write a comment below for me and tell me that you were able to solve this quick quiz let's move ahead and let's look into the case of a decrementing loop so we have a loop we have a for Loop but these things are not looking as good or rather as simple as they were looking here this for Loop looks pretty easy and we are able to make out that the value of I will be from 0 to 6 and this statement will be executed for the values of I from 0 to 6 seven times from 0 to 6 is seven times okay this was very simple for Loop let's write a program and let's try to understand how this decrementing for Loop works so decrementing do c so I've written a boiler plate code now what I'll do is I'll simply what I'll do is I'll save this program and I'll start writing this for Loop okay so I use the snippit but I'll write this so I'll say in I is equal to 5 then we have just I here is I a condition we'll talk about it just a moment IUS minus let me write this down and we are simply printing I so what I'll do is I'll save this I'll copy this and that's it I'll paste it here so we are printing the value of I so I starting from five then I then I minus minus let's try to use the skills that we learned let's try to use the concept of how for Loop Works to decode this and understand what will be printed on the console okay let me close this terminal so I is equal to 5 initially okay this is a condition so what happens is I will be initialized to five this condition will be checked is five true yes five is true any non-zero value is true I've told you before zero is false but five is true so since five is true this will be executed for five so what will be printed the value of I is five will be printed and back sln will be printed now what is the value of I the value of I is four okay so let me write the value of I the value of I is four this is the output and this is the value of I okay now is four true yes four is true four will be printed but the value of I will become three because this will get executed this is the updation condition in a very very similar way three will be printed two will be printed uh sorry the value of I will be two two will not be printed two will be printed after three and the value of I will be one eventually what will happen is the value of I will become zero which will make this condition as false I repeat it will make this condition as false so sometimes you'll have to run the loop one by one one iteration at a time and then only you will understand how this Loop is work working but to make things easier for you I have written how this decrementing follow Loop is working inside the nodes so this SP Loop will keep on running until I becomes zero the loop runs in the following steps I is initialized to five the condition i0 or nonzero is tested the code is executed I is decremented condition I is checked and code is executed if it's not zero because any nonzero value is true in C we have seen that we have learned about that anything which is is not zero is true anything which is zero or evaluates to zero is false in C and so on until I becomes um until I becomes zero okay so as long as I is non zero you'll keep on seeing the iterations as soon as I becomes zero the loop will halt Loop will finish okay I hope I was able to explain you this write a program to print n natural numbers in reverse order and I want you to do this in fact we have already done that but I want you to write this program just take input from the user using scan a function and start writing this code I hope that you liked this concept of decrementing for Loop let's move forward and let's talk about the break statement in C and also let's talk about continu statement in C both break and continuous statements are really very important and see and we are going to look into these two statements now so what is a break statement the brake statement is used to exit the loop irrespective of whether the condition is true or false what does that mean we have seen break in switch case statements by the way let me tell you but now we are going to look at break statement very very closely so break means stop what you are doing just execute the next instruction so if you are executing a switch case statement stop right here go out of switch and execute something else execute whatever is after the switch statement similarly if we are inside a v Loop and I type break or I encounter a break statement what that tells me is stop this y Loop right here and execute the next thing what does it say it says that stop this Loop right here and execute the next thing it can be inside a while loop it can be inside a do while loop it can be inside a fall Loop it can be inside any kind of loop it can be inside a switch statement let me show you how this works so break statement is very important let me comment this and let me also write down dry run for the decrementing Vol Loop okay so let's now let's now start writing this um break. C I'll add the boilerplate code and what I'll do is I'll write a very simple while loop let me copy this while loop from here this is a very simple while loop and we have talked about this while loop a lot okay we are simply incrementing the value of I we are initializing the value of I to zero and I think I copied the loop correctly yes I did um I'll simply say format document it will format the document for me by the way um you can do this if you if you didn't know this you can always do right click format document and that will format your C code in this beautiful fashion okay so in I is equal to zero while I is less than I'll make it 8 so this will print 0 1 2 3 4 all the way till 7 okay if I make it less than equal to it will print starting from zero all the way till eight8 okay 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 and let me execute this and you can see the value of I is 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 okay so this is how it works nothing new here nothing fancy here but let me tell you what is new now so I can write something like this I can say if the value of I is five I want to break out of this Loop and also I'll write a print F here and I'll say we are outside the loop now okay so even if I even when I don't have this one and I run this code you'll see that after the last statement we are outside the loop now is printed okay now what will happen if this is present what will this do this is simply saying if the value of I is five you break out of this Loop so zero will be printed one will be printed two will be printed three will be printed four will be printed but the moment I becomes five this will be encountered this condition will be true break will be encountered and the moment break is encountered it instructs the C compiler to throw the control out of the V Loop so now what will happen is it'll come out of the V Loop okay so let me run this and 0 1 2 3 4 and the moment I becomes five what will happen is this will get executed and what does this mean break means break out of the loop I don't want to execute this Loop anymore I want to stop to right here and I want to jump out of this Loop so where was this Loop starting at line number seven this is the block of the loop and it will jump out of this and will start executing statements from here okay I hope I was able to explain this I hope I was able to explain it pretty well and I hope that uh you understood it okay so let's come back to the notes and read about the break statement it is used to exit the loop irrespective of whether the condition is true or false so the while loop works works on the basis of condition okay it will check the condition again and again if the condition is true it will execute one iteration if the condition is true once again it will execute next iteration and this keeps on Happening Now what will happen is the moment the value of I becomes something which which makes this condition of V Loop fals the V Loop will stop this is one way of stopping the V Loop this is how a v Loop naturally terminates but but if I want to interfere into the natural termination of Y Loop and I want to terminate it based on some other condition I can use break so I can say if the value of I is five stop this y loop I don't care about this condition if the value of five uh if the value of I is five I want this y Loop to be stopped that's it and this is what break statement is doing so brake statement is very easy um this way you can understand it whenever a break is encountered inside the loop the control is sent outside the loop let's see this with the help of an example uh how is my drawing by the way just let me know in the comments if you like this drawing okay for I is equal to 0 I is less than 1000 I ++ so here I'm saying if the value of I is 5 you break so uh what will happen is for the value of zero this will be executed this will be executed so zero is printed for the value of one this will be executed this will be executed so one same for 2 3 4 the moment I becomes five five is printed because we have break after we are printing the five or printing this um percentage debation now the moment five gets printed what will happen is this will evaluate to True since this condition evaluates to True we'll encounter a break statement and since we are encountering a break statement we will come out of the loop okay so this is how it works and it will not go all the way till 1,00 or triple 9 it will not go till 999 it will go only till 5 okay so 0 to9 will not be executed so this is this is something uh which is wrong I should have written 0 to 999 because naturally this Loop will go from 0 to 9999 so I should have written 999 here but I have mistakenly written 100 here so my bad um anyways you got the point you got what break statement in C is let's talk about continue statement now the continue statement is used to immediately move to the next vitation of the loop and listen to me very very carefully when I say this a lot of people confuse between break and continue statements but they are very different okay in the way that brake statement will stop the loop forever but continue statement will not stop the loop forever rather what it will do is it will stop the loop just for this particular iteration it will stop the current iteration of the loop and it will continue with the next iteration let me tell you what continues statement means so let us say we have a program uh in skip is equal to 5 I is equal to 0 while I is less than 10 and I is not equal to skip let us say we have this program how will this program execute I is less than 10 yes it is 0 is less than 10 if I is not equal to 5 continue okay so what will happen is this particular program will keep on executing the instructions inside the V Loop is I not equal to skip for I is equal to Z yes this condition is true so continue continue means that do not execute anything after this just continue with the next iteration same goes for two same goes for three four but the moment I becomes five what will happen is five is not equal to 5 is false so this thing will be executed let me explain this to you by taking you to vs code and uh let me write a program myself and explain this to you and then you will understand this concept like anything thing so I have put this boilerplate code for you what I'll do is I'll simply put a very simple for Loop here let me save this program and now use for and yes I got this snipp it now what I'll do is I'll simply say uh for I is equal to0 I less than 7 I ++ means I'm going from 0 to 6 okay now what I'll do is I'll simply say the value of I is and I'll say percentage D back sln and then I okay and once I do this what will happen is I will be printed from 0 to 6 nothing fancy here 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 now what will happen is if I say if if I is equal to three continue what does this mean this means that if I is equal to 3 we are going to continue continue means that whatever is written below this inside the for Loop we have to keep inside the for Loop we are inside the for Loop keeping the control inside the for Loop skip everything which is below continue so this statement will not be executed let me show you so if I run this program zero is printed one is printed two is printed but the moment I becomes three continue means stop no Don't Stop the Loop just stop stop this current iteration do not continue from here on rather you go directly here and update the value of I and continue like you were continuing okay so what continue means is do not execute anything below me but at the same time also do not stop the loop I hope you got the point so this is all about continue statement and how is continue different from break statement break statement simply says that just stop this Loop whatever be the case stop this Loop we don't want to deal with this Loop anymore continue means we want to deal with this Loop but we want to skip whatever we were doing in the current iteration so we were about to print this but no we are not going to do that the moment C compiler CES continue what it will do is it will go directly here and update the condition and start executing the loop and if it encounters continue once again it will again do this and it'll keep on doing that okay so I hope you got this point and this is all you know I'm trying to explain here I have written all these things in the notes so you can have a read and I hope that this chapter 4 notes will definitely help you and I hope this chapter four Loop control instruction notes will definitely help you let's let's see these notes which I've written for you sometimes the name of the varable might not indicate the behavior of the program and you'll see this a lot okay okay sometimes they'll use index inside the loop but that particular thing will not be the index sometimes they will say integer variable but actually it will be the float variable so they'll do all these things to confuse you for the interviews okay you have to see what kind of variable it is so if I say int integer variable is equal to 3 the value of integer variable is three but if I say float integer underscore value is equal to 3.1 it doesn't mean that it is going to be an integer variable integer variable is the name of the variable but actually it is float so sometimes people will try to confuse you this way you don't have to get confused okay breake statement completely exits the loop we have seen this and continue statement skips the particular iteration of the loop the current iteration will be skipped that's it I hope you got the point I hope these notes were useful let's now move on to chapter 4 practice it and solve some more problems and definitely we'll learn uh these Concepts better there let's move on to chapter 4 practice it now now so here is chapter number four practice set which I have prepared for you let me open this practice set and after I open this practice set we'll solve some problems and definitely you'll get a good hang of the concepts which we have learned in this chapter so the first program says that write a program to print multiplication table of a given number n and yes I have a choice I can either use V loop I can use for Loop and I can also use dowi Loop but I'll smartly use the loop that solves this problem in the easiest way for me let me put the boiler plate code syntax here and um I prefer to use for Loops in most of the cases but if you want to do it with v Loop you can definitely do it so what I'll do is I'll simply say in I is equal to 0 I less than 10 I ++ I'll press the Tab Key and what I'll do is I'll simply say uh percentage d x percentage D is equal to percentage D and I'll put three integers here first will be n the number whose multiplication table I want to print second is going to be the index I and third one is going to be the value n MTI by I so n * by I and also the semicolon and what I will do here is I'll say int n is equal to say three so I want to uh use the value three in place of n so I'll also do one more thing I'll simply say back sln so that you know when whenever I'm am uh I'm printing one line I want a new line right after that so if I run this program you'll see something like this 3 * by 0 all the way till 3 * by 9 but I don't want my I to start from zero all the way till 9 I want to start my I from 1 and I want it to go from 1 all the way till n so what I'll do is I'll start my I from 1 and I'll make it I less than 11 what this is going to do is it will start I from 1 and it will take the value of I from 1 to 10 because I less than 11 uh for the value of 11 this particular condition is going to be false for the value of 10 it is going to be true so let's run and uh let's see if we were able to achieve what we want to achieve here 3 multi by 1 multip by 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 and yes we were able to print the multiplication table of a given number in case you want to take the user input what you do is you simply do something like this in n and then you can use scanf you can use percentage D and you can use M percent n and the moment you do this and run this program let me show you something I'll wait for this program to run okay so it's waiting for my input U the moment I press seven I get the multiplication table of seven I can also say something like this just so that user can know that he needs to enter a value for this program to continue enter the value of n back sln if I run this program I'm getting this prompt enter the value of n the moment I say four I'll press enter and you'll see something like this 4 multip by 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 and finally 10 I hope that you were able to understand how this works I hope that you were able to get a hang of this thing we'll now move on to the next question and um it is really very interesting because it says write a program to print multiplication table of 10 in reversed order so we have a multiplication table and we want to print it in reversed order so we are going to use the same program but in a Twisted fashion what I'll do is I'll say 10 uncore and pr02 doc I'll press enter I'll put the boilerplate code then what I'll do is I'll or or rather what I'll do is I'll simply copy the previous program and I'll paste it here once I do this I have a value and the value is 10 if I'm not wrong I'll get rid of this scanf and all uh cancel I'll save this program I want to start my I from 11 and I want it to go all the way till 1 okay so I'll reverse this condition why am I reversing this condition I'll tell you and I'll make it I minus minus so I'm starting my I from 10 not 11 and also I'll say I greater than Z not 1 why did I do that I want my I to start from 10 then after decrementing it will become 9 then it will become 8 then 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 the moment it becomes zero 0 is not greater than zero so it will start from 10 and go all the way till 1 so if I run this program you can see the multiplication table has been printed in reverse order let me explain you how this works because this is something that you need to understand although I've already explained you this thing in chapter number four but I'm going to explain it once again just so that you have a good hang of it so what we are doing here is we are starting the value of I from 10 then what we are doing is we are simply running this for I is equal 10 because this condition is true so initially what happens is I is initialized to 10 then this condition is checked is I greater than Z yes indeed it's greater than Z now what happens is this gets printed now what happens is this particular update condition is ran now the value of I becomes 9 after this what happens is this condition is checked for the value 9 is it true yes it is true this will run now I becomes 8 because i- minus makes the value of I change from 9 to 8 because IUS minus will reduce the value of I by 1 okay I hope you are understanding how these things work and this keeps on going until the value of I becomes zero and the moment value of I becomes 0o 0 greater than 0 is false and this will not run for the value of I is equal to 0 so if I run this program the value of I starts from 10 and it will go all the way till 1 it will not become zero okay so I hope you understood this now what we'll do is we'll move on to the next question problem number three a doy Loop is executed there are three options and I need to choose one of these three options is it executed at least once is it executed at least twice or at most once and I want you guys to comment down below with the time stamp of the video telling me what the correct answer is I want answer from each and every one of you I'll wait for you to comment I hope everybody commented now let me tell you the answer it's at least once and why why does it execute at least once because in doy Loop we first run the loop body and then we arrive at the condition and if the condition is true we run that um code inside the do blog again and we keep on doing that until the condition is true so initially it will execute no matter what the condition is so it is executed at least once okay moving on to the next question what can be done using one type of loop can also be done using the other types of Loops is it true or is it false it is indeed true because we have already talked about it this same thing can be done using a v Loop because I can always write this outside my V loop I can put this condition inside the condition body of the V Loop uh let me show you where uh let me open these notes and explain you what I mean when I say that so while I can put the condition this for Loop condition inside the while loop here inside the condition and what I'll do is whatever is inside the follow Loop I'll write inside the body of the V Loop and even the update code I can take this update code and I can actually write it after I have written the body of my V loop I hope that you were able to understand this I hope I explained it pretty well to you uh and you can definitely do whatever you want to do with one type of loop with other type of loop okay so this is true okay moving on to the next question question write a program to Su first 10 natural numbers using Y Loop let's solve this problem so I'll say problem five so I'll simply say 11 uncore p05 do c I'll put the boiler plate code and what I will do is I have to print some of 10 first 10 natural numbers so I'll start the value of I from one I'll say while I is less than or equal = to 10 and what I'll do is I'll simply say Su plus equals to what Su plus equals to I I ++ and let me explain you what I've done do I remember all these programs no I don't I don't remember all these programs then what is happening how am I able to write this program so fast it's all about practice but let me explain you how I wrote this program I started I with one and what I'm doing is I'm taking this I from one all the way till 10 so so this condition will be true for the value of I ranging from 1 to 10 and the moment I becomes 11 this condition will be false okay so I'm updating the value of sum I'm keeping on updating this value until the value of I becomes 10 and finally when it becomes 11 the loop body will not run and finally if I write a printf statement I'll say the sum of first 10 natural numbers is percentage D and I'll simply print sum and if I run this program you'll see the value is 55 let me Google this what is the sum of first 10 natural numbers it's 55 yes it's 55 so I was able to find out the value of first um value of the sum of first 10 natural numbers and it was 55 great write a program to implement program five using for Loop and a dowi loop can you do this can you implement the same thing in question number five which I implemented using a while loop can you do the same thing using for and dowi loop I want you to give it a go I want you to give it a go because it will be very um satisfying for you to solve the same problem using a for Loop and using a dowi loop do give it a try and in case you are not able to solve it definitely you'll be able to solve it once I solve the other problems because we have done enough practice of for loops and dowi Loops the next question says that WR program to calculate the sum of the numbers occurring in the multiplication table of 8 so we need to consider 8 multip by 1 all the way till 8 multip by 10 so we need to add 8 16 24 and so on let's see how we can do it so what I'll do is let me create a program for problem number seven so I'll say 12core p07 do c I'll put in the boiler plate code and I'll use a fall Loop let me close the terminal so I'll save this and after saving I'll write for I'll get the code snippet I'll say in I is equal to Zer I is less than 11 and I'll make it one because I want I to start from one and go all the way till 10 also what I'll do is I'll say it sum is equal to zero what this will do is this will simply help me initialize sum and I'll keep on adding to this sum now what I'll do is I'll simply say sum plus equals to and I'll add I multiply by 8 to this and let me see if I'm able to print the sum the I need to use double quotes not single quotes so I'll say the value of sum is percentage D and I'll print the sum let me run it the value of sum sum is 440 so if I add 8 16 24 and so on it will add to 440 okay so it will be 55 * 8 and I'll tell you why why did I say that so the sum from 1 to 10 is 55 and we can take eight common from the equation so if I have 8 * 1 + 8 * 2 and so on I can take 8 common and what I'll get is 8 MTI by 1 + 2+ 3 + 4 plus all the way till 10 which is 55 and if 55 uh is the sum of 1 till 10 the sum for 8 MIP 1 + 8 MIP 2 and so on will be 55 mtip by 8 which is nothing but 440 okay we just got that and we just cross checked that the problem that we solved is indeed correct let's move on to the next question now what is the next question it says write a program to calculate the factorial of a given number using a for Loop let's do this this is an interesting problem so what I'll do is I'll say 13or PR oops I forgot to add this p08 do c I'll put in the boiler plate code by the way what is a factorial factorial of 1 is equal to let me explain you what is a factorial in case you don't know uh in case you know you already know just try out this program in the meantime and I'm explaining people um what what factorial exactly is so when I talk about n factorial it's nothing but 1 * 2 * 3 multiply by and we'll go all the way till in okay now what will happen is if I talk about this equation and let us say I want to calculate four factorial what will be the four factorial I'll go all the way till four so this is the value of 4 factorial which is nothing but 4 * 3 which is 12 * 2 is 24 so 4 factorial is 24 in a very similar way I can always write n factorial is equal to 1 multi by 2 multi by 3 multip by and I can go all the way till the number whose factorial is being calculated now what I'll do is I'll simply say um 0 factorial what is 0 factorial if I put it inside this equation I'll not be able to calculate so 0 factorial let me tell you is defined as one so by definition 0 factorial is one so this is all about factorial how will you calculate the factorial using a for Loop pretty simple just start with one and go all the way till that number and you need that number as well in the equation if you if you look at this equation four is there so we need I less than equal to 4 because I want to start from one and I want to go all the way till four including four I want to include four as well now what I'll do is I'll simply say uh prod multiply is equal to what multiply is equal to I and what is product product is nothing but one make sure you don't put product as zero because if you make it as zero then the answer will be zero always okay and let's also Define n let me try it for four and what I'll do is I'll play some copy paste game here I'll copy a line from here just to save some time I'll say the value of factorial is uh let me call it factorial I just want to name my variables correctly I want to name my variables such that it is easy for you to understand what that variable is doing I'll save this let me run this program the value of factorial is 24 if I change this to five you'll see the value of factorial is 120 if I change this to one the value of factorial is one what if I change this to zero what is the value of factorial it's one great so why is it one for zero because this Loop will not run at all for n equal to0 I is 1 one is not less than equal to zero this Loop will not run keeping the factorial uh value as one and you'll see the value of factorial as one uh whenever uh you try to print this okay so coming back to this question WR a program to calculate the factorial of a given number we already solved this repeat it using Y Loops you need to uh solve this problem using while loop and it is pretty simple all you will do is you'll simply write while you'll say while the value of I is less than equal to n and you'll write the code inside even the updation code you'll write inside the while loop and yes it is very easy to solve I want you guys to comment below if you can solve this problem using while Loops or not make sure to put the time stamp while you are commenting right a program to check whether a given number is prime or not using Loops this is very simple I'll solve it using file Loop and then as part of problem number 11 you can solve this problem using other kinds of Loops okay let me solve this problem for you so we need to find whether a given number is prime or not this is problem number 14 pr10 do c boilerplate code so we need to find whether a given number is prime or not let's call this number as n when is a number prime a number is prime when it is divided by the number itself and and one there should not exist any other number which can divide n okay so how will I solve this problem I'll write a for Loop I'll start I from one I'll in fact start I from two because one will definitely divide that number and I'll go all the way till that number and what I'll do is I'll simply say if i%c or rather n% I equal to equal to 0 which is nothing but if I divides this number n so if the value of I is say five and N is 10 then yes 5 divides 10 so we need to find out whether I divides n or not if that is the case we simply say Prime is equal to 1 okay so let me call it is prime so I'm saying S Prime is equal to 1 and we'll break out of this Loop why am I breaking out of the loop I'm breaking out of the loop because that's all I want to know I want to know whether this number is prime or not I'll by default make my is prime variable as zero why am I doing that I'm doing that because I'm assuming that this number is not a prime number and I'll keep on assuming that I made a mistake here I'll simply say S Prime equals to zero because it will not be a prime number and by default what I'll assume is that it is a prime number until it is proved not to be a prime number so I'll say if n% I is equal to Z is prime is equal to Z so if any number happens to divide this number what I'll do is I'll simply say that this is not a prime number and the that happens I'll break out of this Loop because I now have this information that this is not a prime number and that's all I wanted to know so I'll simply say print F the number is prime back sln when will I print this I'll print this when uh the value of is prime is true so if is prime I'll print this otherwise what I'll do is otherwise I say this is not a prime number number is not prime okay let's see if this program works and I'm going to explain this program once again to you so if n is five yes it is prime let's check for six no it's not prime so yes it's not prime let's check for two is it Prime two is prime yes two is prime let's check for 9 9 is not prime no it's not prime let's check for 91 it's not prime 91 is not prime let's check for 925 it's definitely divided by five so it's not prime it's not prime okay so I hope that you understood how this program to find out whether number is prime or not um I hope you understood the logic of this problem basically what we are doing is we are starting from Two and going all the way till that number to find out whether there exists a number which can divide this number and the moment we find that number what we do is we break out of the loop and we declare the number as not Prime and if we are not able to find such number we assume uh or rather we stick to the Assumption which we initially made that the number was Prime because we were not able to find any number which can divide this number n which clearly proves that N is a prime number okay so this is how the program to write whether a number is prime works now I'll tell you something there is a way to make this program better by changing this n rout 10 but I'm not going into those details I'm not going into data structures and algorithms and making programs efficient I just want you to solve this problem so that you have a good understanding of how C language IFL statements conditionals loops and all these things work I hope you enjoyed this practice set I'll save this Pro uh program and I'll give you this program uh in the form of a zip also I'll give you the notes in the form of a zip so that you have all the notes by end of this chapter so Implement and using other types of Loops is something that you need to solve by yourself I hope that you enjoyed this practice set now we'll move on to chapter number five where things will get even more exciting and we'll learn about more concepts of C so let's move on to chapter 5 now from this video onwards we are going to look into chapter number five which is nothing but functions and recursions what is function and what is recursion we are going to study all these topics in this chapter so I have written something in the notes let's see what it is sometimes our program gets bigger and bigger in size and it's not not possible for a programmer to track which piece of code is doing what so far the programs written by us were very basic they were not very complicated they were around 29 at Max 30 35 lines of codes but what happens is when things get complicated when you have something which is doing a lot of work when you have a code B which contains say 450 to 480 lines of code then you unknowingly might be repeating a piece of logic again and again for example examp let us say you are calculating average of seven numbers inside your program and you are doing that at 21 different places so all those 21 different places which contain say four lines of code to calculate that average can be replaced with a single function call what is a function call we'll see uh what a function call is in this chapter but I'm just giving you an idea of how functions promote code reusability so we want to reuse the code again and again the code which we have written has to be reusable we do not want our code to be inconsistent or say we don't want to repeat our code in our program again and again we'll look into all these things in this chapter so what is a function a function is a block of code which performs a particular task so a block of code performing a particular task is function a function can beused by the programmer in a given program any number of times for example you have written a function which calculates average of three numbers you can reuse that part particular function any number of times and we'll talk about some of the syntax and some of the terminologies associated with the functions and then we'll use functions and see how they can make our program more efficient and effective so here is example syntax of a function so here is a code which I've written for you let me write this code once again in my vs code and that way you'll be able to understand what a function is so I'll simply say 01 function. C I'll add the boiler plate code and let me write something called void display you might be thinking what this void display is and what this void display is doing this is called function prototype this is telling me that display is the name of the function it is going to return void and it doesn't take anything as the arguments so we are going to look into these things if you don't understand what this is we are going to understand this very soon but let me complete this program by saying int a display and return zero so I'll simply say int a then display and then return zero is already here okay now what I'll do is I'll write what is called a body of the function so this is the body of the function I'll simply say print hello word back sln back sln and I'll save this program and let me run this and show you what happens I'm waiting for this program to execute and hello word is printed on the screen how does all these things work let me tell you how all these things are going to work this is something which is called function prototype okay this is something this entire thing from line number five to line number nine uh is the main function so this is the main function this is also a function so this function basically contains the lines of codes which are executed from the beginning so any program or rather any c program starts from the main function now what happens is I'm writing the body of this function so whenever I write function prototype for any given function I'll write the body of that function later and inside this body what I'll do is I'll add some set of instructions and printf hello word backslash is one of those set of instructions so now what I can do is I can use this display and these set of parenthesis to Simply run these set of instructions isn't it cool I I I can say display any number number of times to print hello word you must be thinking why are we saying display to print hello word why can't we simply print a hello word hair itself okay you can do that but what now what if I want to print something like this what if what if I want to print hello word hello two hello word 3 hello word 4 hello word 5 something like this what if I want to print this I can simply say display and this will run these set of instructions so if I run this program now you'll see that hello word 1 2 3 4 and five has been printed on the screen so this is the magic of functions you can have multiple lines of code inside the function body and you can say something like this display and this display when you say display this will execute all these lines so there is something called function prototype and there is something called function definition there's also something called function call which we are going to look into in a bit so function call so this is a function call uh display so basically what we are doing here is we are simply calling the function we are saying that run the body or rather run the instructions inside the body of the function so void display whatever is written inside this set of parenthesis just start executing those lines so hello word one hello word two hello word 3 hello word four hello word five these lines will start getting printed because we have a printf statement now coming back to the notes because I have done a very good job in putting all these Concepts together I've talked about function prototype call and definition inside uh these notes but before we look into those definitions I want to tell you how basically this works in a nutshell so here is the function prototype so void display basically I'm telling that display will be a function it will take nothing as the input and it will output nothing void means nothing okay now whenever I'm writing the body of the function it's called function definition so I'm defining what this function will do do so in function prototype I'm telling what this function will return and what this function's name's going to be and what this function will take as input function definition basically jots all those statements down which will be execut it whenever I call the function and what is the function call and how do I call a function I simply write the name of the function and give the arguments I can pass a number I can pass the things that this function needs luckily this function doesn't need need anything so I don't have to pass anything this simply displays I am printf whenever I say display and whenever I say display and the set of parenthesis semicolon this is a function call and this will execute IM display and IM am display will be printed now let's look into the definition and see how I have explain prototype call and definition in the noes so function prototype is a way to tell the compiler about the function so I'm basically telling about this display function the display is going to be a function it's not going to return anything and it's not going to take anything as an input let us say you have an average function which is going to take three integers so you can you you'll have to write something like this you might have another uh function called uh average which might take int float and int so you'll have to pass these three numbers whenever you're calling the the average function but we don't have any such function let me keep this line I'll simply comment this out so this is the function prototype I am not telling what this function will do inside the function prototype but through function prototype which is a single line I am simply telling that I want a function which is whose name is display it is going to return nothing and it doesn't take anything from the uh user so there is no user input so function prototype is a way to tell the compiler about the function we are going to Define in the program here void indicates that the function returns nothing so this void indicates that this function is not going to return anything okay so I hope that uh that that explains what function prototype is in a good detail uh function call is a way to tell the compiler to execute the function body at the time the call is made so whenever compiler Encounters this display and this parenthesis what compiler will do is compiler will simply start executing these instructions sprintf hi I am display all these instructions will be displayed by the compiler whenever compiler sees such a thing so I hope that you are able to understand how these things are working and how this display function works okay coming back to the notes um function call we have just talked about function call note that the program execution starts from the main function in the sequence instructions are written so the program execution will start from here and whenever this display call is encountered what will happen is that this this function will start executing all these instructions inside this function will start executing Now function definition this part contains the exact set of instruction instructions which are executed during the function call so whenever you call a function you are definitely going to execute some set of instructions what will be those set of instructions those set of instructions are nothing but the lines which are written inside the function this is the function definition it is also called function body and this part contains the exact set of instructions which are executed during the function call when a function is called from meain the main function falls asleep and gets temporarily suspended so let me tell you what happens so whenever this program starts executing what happens is let me show you here whenever this program starts executing what happens is this line will be executed and whenever this line starts to execute the main function will temporarily sleep the main function will be given the instruction to sleep by the compiler compiler will tell the main function that hey main function please rest for some time you need some rest let display function do the job for some time and then we'll come back to you so display function will be active and it will run all these instructions and the moment this display function stops executing the control will come back to the main so main function will be uh awaked by the compiler compiler will tell the main function hey main function please wake up you need to wake up and you need to start your execution and since the display call has already ended this line will be executed and finally this body or rather the main function will stop its execution and hence the prr program will be terminated I hope that you were able to understand uh how this function works okay coming back to the notes we talked about function prototype we talked about function call we also talked about function definition here is a quick quiz for you you have to write a program with three functions the first function is good morning function which prints good morning uh second function is good afternoon function which prints good afternoon and the third one is goodn night function which prints good night so let's see how we can solve these three problems all you have to do is uh you have to write the body of these function and then there is something else which is given in the question which is main should call all of these functions in this order so first one will be executed first then second one will be executed then the third one will be executed so let's write this program so what I'll do is I'll say 02 uncore quore quiz. C and I'm going to write the boiler plate also I'm going to write the function prototype so I'll simply say void uh let me see the names of the function uh so good morning good afternoon good morning is a function good afternoon is going to be a function good afternoon and then good night is going to be a function so good night is a function these three are functions now I'm going to write the body of these functions so what I'll do is I'll simply copy this then I'll paste this this and then I'll start writing print F and what I'll say is I'll say good morning back sln back sln simply means that I want to give a new line after this line is printed so good morning will be printed and then a new line will be printed and what I'll do is I'll repeat the same thing for all these functions so I'll write the same thing for good afternoon I'll write the same thing for good night so I'll say afternoon and and I'll say night okay so good afternoon good night good morning okay so these three are the functions which we have written let's execute them one by one and in order to execute them one by one what I'll do is I'll copy this uh right here I'll press the Tab Key now I'll simply click here and I will remove this void I'll save the program let me run this good morning good afternoon good night so these three functions are hence executed in order okay I hope that this explains the concept of functions and you were able to understand what function definition call in Prototype is now I have joted down some important points for you which are really very important because you would want to know about how to use and when to use functions in C so execution of a c program always starts from Main never think that any function which is at the top will be executed first no that's not going to happen always and always the C compiler will will start looking for the main function first and it will execute it first so execution of a c program starts from the main function main function is the function which is actually executed as soon as the program starts executing okay we have some more important points every function gets called directly or indirectly from Main so whenever you run a c program main is the function which will start executing first so naturally any function which gets executed will be directly or indirectly be called from Main so there are two types of functions in C we'll talk about them there are two kinds of function the first one is Library functions and the other one is user defined function what is a library function commonly required functions group together in a library file on disk so Library function is something that C programming libr already has to offer you you don't have to write the logic of those functions what is user defined function user defined function is a function which is declared and defined by the user so if I want to write a custom function to calculate the number of shipments in my uh say corer company I will have to write that function nobody's going to provide me that let us say I'm going to uh you know start making cell phones from tomorrow and I have to write a function which is going to tell me that how much money I'm making per cell phone per single sale of cell phone um is making me say 10 Rupees I want to write a function which can look into the different parameters and automatically calculate this number for me I will have to write this function so it has to be a user defined function I cannot expect a c compiler to ship with this function naturally I'll have to write it so these are the functions which are custom and they are custom tailored for your needs so you'll have to write those but there are some of the functions which you might need for example there's a function called P pow we have talked about pow which is used to raise a number to the power of another number so these kinds of functions are Library functions and the these are readily available uh inside a library file you might also want to talk about uh averaging three numbers inside your program and if you want to average three numbers you might get a library function for that inside your program let us say you want to sum 10 numbers you want to find the sum of 10 numbers you might get Library function for that so anything that is not specific to your needs anything that is very very generic you will get it in the library functions some of the other Library will give you that function we'll talk about some of the library functions later in this course but uh we talked about user defined functions in fact our display function was a user defined function so this is about user defined functions and Library functions I hope you were able to understand what these are now we'll talk about why we need to use functions why use functions to avoid rewriting the same logic again and again so let us say I want to print good morning or let let me come back to this one uh let us say I want to print this particular um pattern hello word one hello word 2 hello word 3 4 and five that is I want to print this 10 times so I don't have to copy these five lines and copy them again 10 times making them 50 lines I can actually do this by simply copying this any number of times I want it to execute so if I wanted to execute 10 times I can copy this particular line 10 times I hope that you are able to understand this and I hope that you you are able to see what I mean by uh by by saying that you will avoid rewriting the same logic again and again if you use functions functions will also help you keep track of what you are doing in a program so if we have uh a logic divided into different functions we can focus on one function and start debugging that function if that function is not performing as usual the third thing is to test and check logic independently so I can actually have say a person called rohand Das write this function and a person called Jacob write another function and a and and a person called uh say sonali write another function and these three people can work independently on three different functions and what I will give them is a function prototype I'll tell them that I want this particular return return value from my function and I want to give these two or these three or these four values as an input to this function and those people will have to manage the logic that will be written inside the body of this function if that makes sense I I hope that you were able to understand this now we'll talk about passing values to the functions passing values to functions is something that you will definitely want to learn what does it mean it simply means that there is a function it takes some values as an input and gives an output you need to receive output by giving some inputs and uh you will definitely want to use a function like sum where you are supplying two input values and you are expecting an output value from your function let's see how all these things work uh we can pass values to a function and we can get a value in return from a function for example let us say sum is a function and we have two values which we are supplying to sum as an input what are those two values those two values are A and B if these values are three and four I will expect my sum to return an integer which is nothing but seven because 3 + 4 is 7 similarly if a is five and B is three I I I would expect this sum to give me eight in return because sum of these two numbers is eight now the above prototype means that sum is a function which takes values A and B of type int so a is an integer B is an integer and whatever I'm getting in return is an integer now it is not necessary that if you're supplying integers you will get an integer you might get a float as well for example um in case of a function which calculates average of two numbers you might expect a float or you might expect a double in return but again uh in this case I'm giving A and B which are integers and I'm expecting in an output which is an integer okay so this will return a value which is of type int so sum will return a value of type int Now function definition of sum can be something like this so I'll say something like this I'll say int sum int A B A and B are input to sum in C will store the output I'll simply say C is equal to a plus b I'll make the calculation and finally I'll return return the value of C so A and B are called parameters I'm supplying a and B to sum and I'm expecting a value C which is calculated by this function sum let's see how this thing works what I'll do is I'll simply say passing underscore values. C I add a boiler plate template and let me do one thing I'll simply uh you know copy a function prototype from here or let me write it uh write it down once again I'll simply say sum int int so what this means is that sum is a function it returns an integer and takes two integers now I'll write the body of sum I'll simply say int a int B sum is a function which takes a and b as an input and what does it return it returns a plus b so we don't even need a variable C we can simply say return a plus b and this will take care of everything now if I do something like this and I say the value of 5 + 7 is I can do something like this I can say sum 5 5A 7 and this will actually calculate this 5 + 7 for me and it will print 12 for me so 5 + 7 is I should have written percentage D my bad so this value will actually come here so it will return me to L let me show you the value of 5 + 7 is 12 how does all these things work so the execution of a program always starts from the main function so when we are starting the program we'll start it from here this line will be the first line to get executed but while this line is being executed we'll encounter another function call so what will happen is main call will be suspended compiler will tell main hey main you were executing but I want you to wait for some time because now sum is executing and let sum bring its value and once sum brings its value we are going to put that value here and we are going to um then continue your execution then execution of the main function will continue so what happens is this function uh the main function will get suspended for some time and some function will uh start to execute I'm talking about this suum function this function will start to execute and what happens is this calculates the value A+ B and it Returns value 12 so 12 is returned back to the main function so this can be replaced with 12 so I can do something like this I mean in my mind obviously in the program uh we are not going to change the program but during the execution what happens is this value is replaced by 12 and what what will this line print then this will print the value of 5 + 7 is 12 so percentage T will be replaced by 12 I hope you got the point I hope you understood how uh we can pass values to a function and we can expect a value in return from the function now we can call sum 2 3 from Main to get five in return so if you say in D is equal to sum 2 comma 3 sum 2 comma 3 will return five and D will become five because this value will be replaced by five I have written some notes here so the note number one says parameters are the values or variable placeholders in the function definition for example A and B so parameters are nothing but values or variable placeholders what are values and what are variable placeholders values can be 2 three or something it can also be a variable placeholder for example I can do something like this I can say int a is equal to 5 and int B is equal to 7 and I can actually say sum a comma B that will also do that is also valid so a is 5 b is 7 so this thing remains unchanged the output will be the same but just in case you want to use variables you can always do that okay note number two says that arguments are the actual values pass to the function to make a call for example 2 and three okay so I want you to uh understand the difference between parameters and arguments now let me tell you one thing if you are talking about code and programming or C programming with somebody they might interchangeably use parameters and arguments but again you should know the core key difference between parameters and arguments what is the difference between parameters and arguments I'll tell you using um an example okay so two and three are the actual values which are being passed so which values are passed five and seven are passed so five is an argument s is an argument in this case Okay so actual values which are passed to the function are arguments but what are parameters A and B are parameters so if I talk about this function A and B are parameters for this function but if I talk about this function called A and B or rather five and seven are the arguments so when I'm looking here I'll use the word argument A and B are arguments but when I'm looking here at the function body I'll use the word parameter now again nobody's going to ask you this question until unless you are sitting in some interview and your interviewer really takes some interest in this question but just in case you wanted to know the difference between parameters and arguments this is the real difference and you should definitely know it the third Point says that function can return only one value at a time so one function can return only one value at a time in C language this is something that you should know as well if the past variable is changed inside the function the function called doesn't change the value in the calling function what does this mean mean let me give you an example okay now if the past variable is changed inside the function for example I have a function called change and I change this value a is equal to 77 no this will not change the value in the main let me give you an example if I say something like this uh oops if I if I say something like this C is equal to 9 and if I have int C isal to 8 here and if I print the value of C is and let me print the value of C also I'll put a back sln just so that my uh code looks good now if I run this uh or let me even pass C I know I don't have to pass C but again I'm passing C uh let me pass C and C but I'm only operating on A and B now let us say I am changing the value of C inside this function I'm making it 9 from 88 what will be printed 9 will be printed or 88 will be printed the answer is 88 will be printed let me run this program for you okay so I need to change this function prototype as well because I have two integers here I need to make it three integers now the value of C uh 5 + 7 is 12 and the value of C is 88 so we are not able to change the value of the main function inside the sum function so this is something that you need to keep in your mind this is really very important I and why does this happen whenever a function executes it has its own set of variables so a belongs to the main function B belongs to the main function C belongs to the main function now once again inside the sum function this C belongs to the sum function so this is maintained separately from this C so this is a c of main function this is a c of sum function so we also call these values as local variables so these are local variables of sum and this is a property of mean so we cannot notot change the property of mean from sum just like you cannot change um change the volume of the radio of your neighbor sitting at your home if that makes sense you cannot do that definitely if he gives you the knob you can change if if he you know ties a thread to the knob and you know throws at your house and you can pull the knob somehow then definitely you can change but again directly you cannot change merely sitting at your room you cannot change the TV channel of your neighbor so this is maintained differently your TV is different your neighbor's TV is different you cannot change your neighbor's Channel by using your remote on your TV okay I I've given enough an analogies and I've also written this in the notes changes a function which changes a to 77 now it should be now now if we call it from mean like this then uh this will print the value 22 so we cannot change the value just like we saw in example here we cannot change the value of main function variable from some of the function this happens because a copy of B is passed to the change function so what happens is the these a B and C are not directly passed to sum the copy of these variables is passed to sum so this this and this will remain unchanged if you try to change it from the sum function okay so this is something that you need to keep in your mind now we have a quick quiz here use the library functions to calculate the area of a square with side a so we need to use some Library function to calculate the area of a square with side a how do we do that we can use a user defined function in this case we can simply say a square because we know that a square is the area but since we have to use Library function we can use a library called math.h so I'll say C programming matt. H so all you need to do is simply include this matt. H so I'll use the first result that comes up on Google let me show you how um P pow function from matt. works so uh p is a function double power xou y so I'll show you how this works so firstly what you need to do is you need to include this Library matt. so let me make a program 04 uncore Quake quiz 04 uncore quore quiz. C let's enter boilerplate code let's include m.h and I'll simply use Sprint F the area of the square is all I'll do here is I'll say the area of the square is I'll say percentage D and what I'll do is I'll use the power function and all I'll do is I'll simply say a to the^ 2 and what is a a is the side of the square so if I have two uh I should be getting uh four as the area okay let me use a double variable okay let me use a double variable so that we can use values with decimal Precision so able a is equal to 2 and we don't use percentage D for double we use percentage LF for double and if I run this program you'll see the area of square is four so even if I have 2.2 you'll see something like this so the area of the square is 4.84 I hope that makes sense and you were able to understand how we solve this quick quiz using Library functions now if you are getting confused uh with what these Library functions are and how we going to use it uh in the later chapters do not get worried about about all these things let me tell you all you need to know at this point is that we have used m.h and a function from m.h which simply raises a number with the power of two in this case we can even raise it to the power of three four or any other number but in this case we are simply raising it to the power two so PO is a function from matt. H this is all you need to know at this point coming back to the notes we'll talk about recursion now recursion is really a very important topic when it comes to C programming and we are going to discuss it in great detail let's talk about what we have in recursion a function defined in C can call itself this is called recursion a function calling itself is also called a recursive function okay so this is something that you need to know a function defined in C can call itself so if I have a function called sum it can call sum once again and this is called recursion in C language so a function calling itself can also call um is also called recursive function so we can call a function which calls itself as a recursive function now you must be thinking what this recursion is and why should I even bother about recursion when I can write programs in other ways recursion is sometimes the easiest way to solve a problem because the formula contains recursion for solving the problem I I'll tell you what this means uh and we'll take an example of factorial in this case and this is going to explain you everything because factorial is an example which explains recursion very well so let's come to the notes sorry the code and what we'll do is we'll create a program called factorial doc let me write a boiler plate code and I told you what factorial is already but let me tell you once again factorial what is factorial factorial 5 is nothing but 5 * 4 * 3 * by 2 * 1 okay and factorial n is nothing but you start from n you keep on reducing number to nus1 then you keep doing this for n minus 2 then you do this for n minus 3 and you go all the way till 1 so n n-1 n- 2 nus 3 and you go all the way till one okay so this is how factorial works and uh if it is five here you'll go from five and you can you'll keep on reducing the integer until it becomes one if it is nine you'll keep on reducing the number and keep on multiplying those numbers till it becomes one so 5 4 3 2 1 and once again if the value is 13 13 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 and so so you understood how factorial works now now the same thing has been written in the notes as well I've written factorial n is 1 * 2 * by all the way till n so you can either write it like this or you can write it in a reverse manner 1 2 3 4 all the way till n uh it's the same thing okay but we have a special case of factorial 1 which is very clear that the value of factorial 1 is one this one is clear but we have a special case of factorial 0 what if the value is zero so factorial 0 is defined as one this is something that you need to keep in mind so this is a mathematical formula and we Now understand how factorial works now listen to me very very carefully let us say we have this formula factorial n is equal to this thing and I want to change it I mean I want to write it in a different way how can I do that can I not write factorial n is equal to n * by this thing yes we can we can write it it's it's what it is written okay this is what what is written here now what is this value what is the value n-1 * nus 2 all the way till 1 isn't it not factorial N minus1 I hope you understood that this is factorial n minus one so I can replace this with factorial n minus1 I can do that right I can yes I can do that because by definition of factorial n this is the formula and factorial n minus one will be this value so factorial n is equal to n into factorial n minus1 and we are going to use this to our advantage we are going to use this formula to calculate the values of factorial let's see how we can do that okay so what I'll do is I'll write a function called factorial and this simply takes a number a or rather n let me call it it n because I'm calling it n here as well also I'll write a prototype factorial n that's it okay now what I'll do is I'll simply write this formula I'll say return what is factorial n factorial n is n * factorial n minus1 I'll say return the value n multip by same function for n- one okay and that's it that's it so what will happen is it will keep on reducing the value of N and it will keep on calculating the factorial I'll show you the tree how this will work so a very good example of recursion is factorial I've written factorial n's value then I've showed you that factorial n is equal to n * factorial n minus 1 now since we can write factorial of a number in terms of itself we can program it using recursion how will we program it using recursion let's see let us say I I've supplied four to this so it will calculate 4 multip by then it will wait for factorial of 3 it will say 4 * by then it will it will start calculating the value of factorial 3 then it will be 3 * by it will start calculating the factorial of two and so on so there will be a time that this value will start going into negative factorial minus1 factorial min-2 we don't want that so what we do is we write a base condition we say if the value of n is 1 or the value of n is what or the value of n is zero simply return one so we say return one if this is the case okay and that's all that's the program to write factorial I'm not saying that you understood how factorial program works I'm going to explain it even more but I'm telling you that this is all I need to write to calculate factorial let's see if this program works the value of factorial 4 is percentage D so I'll simp please say uh factorial 4 uh now what I'll do is I'll run this program the value of factorial 4 is 24 let's check 4 * 3 is 12 m 2 is 24 yes it is correct let's change this to five and let's see if it turns out to be 120 because 24 * 5 is 120 let's see if this works and yes it works 24 * 5 is 120 great now if I make it six I'll have to multiply this by six and it it should turn out to be 720 let's save this program and run it 720 yes this works but how does it work let let's try to understand it even more how this function is working so whenever a value n is received let us say four is received what happens is this condition is not true because n is not one n is not zero n is four so what happens is let me show you here I'm saying factorial 4 what happens is that the C compiler will start running Factor function for the value 4 but what I'm returning here is I'm breaking it down to 3 * factorial of 3 so I'm simply saying sorry 4 MIP factorial 3 n * factoral n minus 1 so I'm doing something like this but this is not yet resolved I need to further calculate the value of factorial 3 so now it becomes 3 * factorial 2 okay now factorial 2 is still not resolved I'll try to resolve it once again and it will be 2 MTI factorial 1 but as soon as I reach one what will happen is this condition will become true and instead of returning this what will I return I'll return this and let me tell you something as soon as a function encounters a return statement it will not execute anything below that so as soon as I see return it means stop the function we are done we got the value and we don't need to run this function any further so as soon as factorial 1 starts running this condition will be true because the value of n is 1 it's n = to 1 or Nal to 0 is true because n is 1 so what happens is one is return and now all the values are resolved so compiler can now uh now start to calculate this value which is nothing but 24 okay 3 * 2 is 6 6 * 4 is 24 so this is how this program is working so this is a dry run this is called dry run of factorial 4 and I'm going to give you all these programs in the form of a zip file make sure you download all the programs that I'm giving you it is really very important for you to download notes as well as all these programs which I'm giving you because all these programs also contain a lot of good Concepts like dry run and I've written a lot of comments in the programs just for you okay so this is how this works now let's come back to the notes and see how this works so i' I've I've written the same thing in the notes as well a program to calculate factorial using the recursion so this is the program in case you want to see see the notes and type it out now how does this work I've explained the same thing factorial 5 will be broken down into 5 into factorial 4 now further factorial 4 will be broken down into 4 into factorial 3 and so on until we encounter this I've explained it here I've explained it for the value of factorial 4 in the notes I've explained it for the value of factorial 5 I hope all this makes sense okay now I have written some important notes for you and the notes are um recursion is sometimes the most direct way to code an algorithm just like we saw in the example of factorial there is another example very classic example of recursion it is called Fibonacci series we are going to see that in the practice set but again I'm just telling you sometimes a mathematical formula can directly be written inside the function and we are all done so recursion is some sometimes the most direct and easiest way to solve a problem now the condition which which doesn't call the function any further in a recursive function is called as the base condition what is the base condition here this is the base condition base condition ensures uh that we are not calling the function infinitely we don't want to do that we always want to stop somewhere and base condition takes care of that okay sometimes due to a mistake made by the programmer a recursive function can keep running without returning result uh resulting in a memory error so sometimes you might make your program throw a memory error just because you have made a mistake for example let let us say uh I forget to write this base condition what will happen is this particular function will keep on running and running and running uh until the memory is full and we don't want that so we don't want memory or errors from our program so we need to be very very careful when we are writing programs using recursions I hope that makes sense and you were able to understand functions and recursions this chapter was about function and recursions I hope I was able to explain all the things in a very good way make sure you download the notes make sure you download the code uh it is going to really help you with the revision and I also advise you to download these notes and take a print out from your nearest zero Center that would be uh better than the PDF but if you are a PDF person you you can download the PDF as well I have everything in the description let's now move on to chapter 5 practice set and see what are the problems that we can solve uh for functions and recursions let's move on to chapter 5 practice set now so here is the chapter 5 practice set which I have created for you this practice set contains a lot of problems which can help you understand functions and recursions so let's move ahead towards Visual Studio code and start solving some of these problems so question number one says that write a program using functions to find average of three numbers so let's start writing this code uh so what I'll do is I'll simply say 06 pr01 doc I'll add the boilerplate code and all I have to do at this point is I have to write a program using functions to find average of three numbers so what will be the return type of my function so if the name of my function is average and let us say it takes three integers what will be the return type of this function I want you guys to comment down below and tell me what will be the return uh return type what is the ideal return type that I should write here I'm waiting for your comment all right in case you commented I I will tell you what should be the return type it should be double or float float is also the correct answer double is a bit more precise because if you have a very large number double will take care of that but why did we use double here we use double here because we might get the average as a decimal number so let us say the average of 1 2 and 3 3 + 3 is 6 divid 3 is 2 it's an integer so no problems but let us say I want to find average of 1 1 and 1 it's 1 by3 or 33 and 33 cannot be stored in an integer it can be stored in a double or in a uh floating Point number okay so I can either use a floating Point variable or I can also use a double type variable but I cannot use integer uh I might lose Precision in case I use integer so I'll simply say int a int B and in C so I have three numbers and it's returning a double so what I'll do is I'll simply return a plus b + C / 3 and also just to be sure that A + B plus is calculated before this this number is divided by three I'll put on the parenthesis so this is the average of three numbers and we all know about averages average is something which is uh very very easy thing and we all know about it but again we have to write a program to calculate average of three numbers using functions okay so I'll simply say print T the average of 4 and three is percentage I'll say percentage LF and also what I'll do is I'll simply write 1 4 and three because I want to calculate the average of these three numbers let me put a semicolon here return zero and let's see what answer we get so it's 2 so 4 + 1 is 5 5 + 3 is 8 you must be thinking why is this the case why are we not getting the correct answer the average of 1 4 and 3 is definitely not two but why are we getting two it's because this and entire enti is going to be an integer a plus b plus C is going to be an integer because it's a sum of three integers and three is an integer and integer divided by integer is going to return an integer and you're going to lose Precision so in order to fix this I'll simply say 3.0 and I'm going to get the correct answer I hope you understood how uh you know very basic things in C can get you some error C is a very basic programming language and you need to take care of each and every bit if you want your program to do the intended t task I hope you enjoyed this problem coming back to the practice set the next question says that write a program using function to convert Celsius temperature into fahrenheit so if I say Celsius to Fahrenheit there is a Formula that I'm going to use I'm going to directly use this formula and uh once I use this formula I will be able to write a function which will convert celsus to forite okay so let's do one thing let's uh let's try to uh you know create another program and keep the things in a very nice order so that you know when you come back to these programs you can simply see where I have written which program and you'll be able to understand the entire course very well if I have all these programs in a good structure so let's do one thing uh let's start solving this problem and what I'll do is I'll simply say uh int Celsius or let me call it in C and I'll say int f and what I'll do is I'll simply write down this formula but I have to use functions okay so I'll simply say uh float let me use floats this time Celsius to Fahrenheit and uh Celsius to Fahrenheit or fhe to Celsius convert Celsius temperature into fahrenheit Okay cool so I need to convert Celsius to Fahrenheit and what what will be the input of this function Celsius and c will be the input now what I'll do is I'll copy this code here uh definitely it's not a code I'll simply say int f is equal to and let me make this as float as well let let's keep everything in float uh degrees Celsius multiply will be replaced with star and C 9x 5.0 just in case um and here will be C uh and what else what else what else I need to remove this okay so what I'll do is I'll simply put a semicolon here and this is forhe temperature using uh Celsius uh temperature so let me check the formula once again so if I want to convert a Celsius to forhe I simply put C here and uh that will give me the forhe temperature cool I think I'm doing it right I I need to return F now and also I need to write a print F uh and and I'll say the value of zero degree in foren heit is percentage LF or percentage F because we are using float here let me call it percentage f as well so of uh the first value is Celsius C and the second value is f and yes I'm going to use this formula I'm going to use this function I'll say int f is equal to C to F and I'll pass in the C that's it and also I'll convert this to float and let me say float C is equal to Z so C is z let's see what we get okay so I I I need to put this uh let me do something like this I'll say 0.0 I'll simply use uh float here and this is the function prototype let me run this program now and the value of this much in forhe is this much how much is uh 37° C in Fahrenheit let's check that so it should be around 98 and yes it's around 98 and yes the program works and uh works pretty great now let's um start with the third problem which says write a function to calculate force of attraction on a body of mass m exerted by the Earth so how much is the force exerted by Earth uh on a body of mass m the force is equal to mass into acceleration and here the force is going to be mg so what we'll do is we'll simply multiply M with G and I want you to solve this problem so simply uh use your Visual Studio code and and write this program the function should return the mass multip by G whose value is 9.8 I hope that you'll be able to solve this and this is really very simple and straightforward problem as well so I want you to solve this on your own own uh and I'll move on to the next problem and this is the problem I was waiting for the problem is super simple it simply says that write a program using recursion to calculate nth element of Fibonacci series now in case you don't know what is Fibonacci series let me tell you so Fibonacci series starts from 1 1 2 3 and any next number is going to be the sum of previous two numbers so if I were to find out third element of a Fibonacci series it will be two how did I get this two let me zoom in a bit how did I get the get to this two I simply added the first two numbers I simply added first two numbers one and one and here is the next number of Fibonacci series how to get the next number I simply add the previous two numbers how to get the next number I simply add the previous two numbers how to get this 8 5 + 3 how to get this 13 8 + 5 how to get the next number it's going to be 13 + 8 which is 21 we have to automate this and we we are going to use recursion to do this how do we use recursion we'll simply write a function that calls itself and we are going to create a formula for calculating and term of a F Series so let's write a program which is program number eight of this um of this chapter and this is problem number four if I'm not wrong and I'm going to write dot C and yes it's problem number four so what I'll do is I'll simply put the boiler plate code first I'll write a function I'll say int Fibonacci series element number n is going to be Fibonacci nus1 plus Fibonacci n minus 2 so this is the previous number and this is previous to previous number so if I add previous two numbers I should get uh this um the nth Fibonacci number and uh let's start this n with one because I want to count it from one uh the first number is this second number is this third number is this so what is fib one it's one what is fib 2 it's one so what I'll do is I'll simply write a base condition where I'll say if n = to 1 or or n is equal to 2 what should I do I should simply return one because Fibonacci 1 is going to be one Fibonacci 2 is going to be one so I'm returning one otherwise I'm adding the previous two numbers now I can simply say uh print F I'll say the nth element of Fibonacci series is percentage D now what I'll do is simply um simply put uh FIB n and I'll create a variable n I'll simply say n is equal to 4 and now what I'll do is since I since I've written FIB 4 how will it calculate it will simply break FIB 4 down to FIB 3 uh plus FIB 2 okay now it will start to calculate FIB 2 as FIB 1 plus okay so FIB 2 is already one it will return one and so on let's see if I'm able to get the fourth element of Fibonacci series I have made some mistake it seems uh what is the mistake no I actually selected okay so I haven't written function prototype so let me write function prototype and let me tell you something if you write the function before main function you don't even have to write function prototype but it's always a good practice to write function prototype let me save this and let me run it again and the nth element of Fibonacci series and let me do one more thing instead of doing nth I'll simply say percentage D and I'll simply say so that I can say that the element four of Fibonacci series let me get rid of this percentage and from percentage D from here and let me format it like this so element four of Fibonacci series is three is it true let me check so 1 and 1 then 1 + 1 is 2 then 2 + 1 is three so fourth element is three indeed uh how about let me generate Fibonacci series then 3 + 2 is 5 then 5 + 3 is 8 uh 8 then 8 + 5 is 13 then 13 + 8 is 21 and so on this is a Fibonacci series let me now run this program for n is equal to 8 okay let me write uh run this for n is equal to 8 and eth element is 21 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 yes it's right so this way we are able to find the next elements of Fibonacci series using recursion so recursion is a function that calls itself in case you are still wondering how I got to this equation FIB n minus one is the previous number and FIB n minus 2 is the previous to previous number okay so if we add these two numbers we are going to get the next number and this is the base condition which simply says that the first and the second element is going to be one and since I've already told you that return one will simply stop the F function execution so as soon as a function sees return it will halt there itself it it will not execute any further instruction so in case you are wondering if this is executed I mean if return one is met by the C compiler will this line also get executed or something else which is Below return will get executed or not no it will not get executed so if I'm writing anything below return it's not going to get executed just because return means finish the function call that's it we got the value we needed and we are not going to run this function anymore okay so I hope you were able to understand this let's now move on to the next question which says what will be the following uh what will the following line produce in a c program so we have to find what will the following line produce in a c program let us assume the value of a as three and let's let's try this out so what I'll do is I'll simply copy this program and uh I'm going to write program number nine which is problem number five and I'll simply add boilerplate code here and also what I'll do is I will uh I will simply type this print F 3 percentage D I'll say percentage D percentage D percentage D and what I'll do is 3% D then back sln back sln back sln now what I'll do is A++ a and A++ A++ a and A++ so this is how the question uh asks us what will be the value of this so a then Plus+ a then A++ okay so let's start this so initially what will happen is a will get printed for sure so we'll get a four okay we'll get a four and then Plus+ a Plus+ a will initially increment the value of 4 to 5 and then print the value of a which is five but since the value of a is now five a ++ will first print the value of five then increment it to six so now the value of a is six but we are not printing the value of a and anymore so if I comment this out now you must be thinking that this is the final answer I'll show you something if I run this program you'll see that 664 is being printed on the screen and you must be thinking what is happening what is this and let me tell you something why this happens and also I want to tell you something U which is also very important if you are tackling such questions in an interview okay first of all write WR in such a statement in your C program is not at all recommended because different compilers are going to deal with this particular line in different ways one way to evaluate this was this where we got four five and five as the answer but it turns out that the compiler which is installed on this machine is decoding this as this so we'll we'll uh try to understand why 66 and 4 is the output of this program for this compiler what has this compiler done to get to this output uh and then we'll talk about whether you should answer these question in an interview in this way or not okay okay let's get started so what this compiler is doing is this compiler is basically receiving A++ a and A++ uh as an argument of print F what happens is this compiler is designed in a way that it evaluates all these three lines from right towards the left okay so A++ will will be evaluated first so A++ will be evaluated first and a will be printed four will be printed then since the value of a is now five A++ means that print value as four and make the value of a as five now when I say plus plus a the value of a becomes six and six is printed because we are incrementing first and then printing so five becomes six and six is printed and when I print a the final value of a is printed which is nothing but six so hence the output but what if you get this question on a whiteboard you should reply that compiler might either choose to um you know either choose to resolve these three lines from right to left or left to right one of the smartest way to solve this problem is you can tell your uh interviewer that I can solve it from left to right and most of the people are going to solve it left to right so I'm going to solve this right to left and show it to you this way your interviewer will know that you know all these Concepts you understand that a compiler might deal with this particular line in a different way but whenever you are writing a c program never ever use such kind of thing inside a printf statement because different kind of compilers might look add this code in a very different way so I hope that this question helped you a lot and you were able to understand uh intricacies of printf and increment operators the next question says that find a write a recursive function to calculate sum of first and natural numbers recursive function right okay let's write it let's solve this problem this is problem number six program number 10 10or pr06 06 do c let me write the boiler plate code and let me try to see what sum of first and natural number is it's nothing but 1+ 2+ all the way till n so we'll have n minus one somewhere here and then we'll have n okay this is how sum is calculated okay can I not write sum of N is equal to sum of N - 1 + n can I do this yes definitely I can do this and a recursive function is ready so what I'll do is I'll simply say In Sum n I'll say return sum of nus 1 + n so that's all but I'll have to define a base condition I'll say if n = to 1 what you do is you return one so the moment we start receiving one as the input what will happen is um the moment it becomes sum one we are going to get one as the output let's see if this works I'll say print f um and then I'll say sum of first five natural numbers is is percentage D and I'll simply say sum five and I'll put a semicolon let's see if this works I'll save this program as well uh the moment I run this okay so I need to write function prototype and also I should write int here my bad uh I should write int here like this and yes this should work now let's see what it gives me so is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 15 let's check so 1 + 2 is 3 3 + 3 is 6 and then 6 + 4 is 10 and 10 + 5 is 15 and yes we are right okay let's try to find sum of first three natural numbers and I know for sure that sum of first three natural numb is six so if I run this program you'll see some of first three natural numbers is six so all it takes to solve a problem using recursion is to come up with a recursive relationship and plug it into the function and that's it you just type the mathematical formula in a very smart way Insight a function with a base condition this is important always use a base condition because if you don't use base condition you you are you are going to deal with a lot of problems your function might keep on running indefinitely and you would definitely not want that okay now the last problem which is write a program using functions to print the following pattern so you have to print first end lines of this pattern what is this pattern by the way by the way so the first line contains or rather first row contains only one star the second row contains three stars the third row contains five stars so I I I'll have to generate the odd number 1 3 5 7 9 and so on and I'll have to print those many stars let's see if I can do it I'll give it a try 11 p07 do c boiler plate code uh I'm I'm going to give it void star and int and I'll say void star intn all the logic will come here and I'll simply call Star four let us say okay so I have to write first n line so definitely I'm going to use a for Loop I'll say in I is equal to Zer I is less than n i ++ and after that what I'll do is I'll simply print a back sln and you must be thinking what I'm doing how I know that I have to print a back sln uh so the thing is all I need to do is I just have to you know print I'll simply write down in uh very plain and simple English I'll say print uh 2 N minus one stars or rather 2 n + 1 sorry because I'm starting my from zero what does it mean here I'm saying print 2 n + one Stars so whenever you have to write a odd number in the form of n what you do is or let me change it to 2 I + 1 because we are starting I from zero 2 I + 1 Stars means when I when the value of I is zero this will be one when the value of I is 1 this will be three then when the value of I is 2 this will be five so we are able to generate 1 3 5 7 9 using 2 I + 1 I hope you understood that now I'll simply replace this with a loop and I'll simply say for J is equal to Z J is less than 2 * I + 1 what is this 2 * I + 1 this will result into uh 2 I + one star so if I have to print one star this this will be one and then for the next iteration it'll be three then five then seven then N9 and here what I'll do is I'll simply say print F star semicolon and the moment I run this you'll see that I am able to get the pattern that I wanted so for the value of n is equal 4 I'm getting four lines once again if I were to tell you how this works I'm calling this function here and inside the function what I'm uh doing is I'm having a nested for Loop so a for Loop inside a for Loop what this for Loop is doing is it is generating the value of I all the way from 0 to n minus one okay so so if the value of n is 4 it is generating 0 1 2 and 3 now what this for Loop is doing is it is using those values of I which is 0 1 2 and three and generating one star three star five star Seven Star Nine Star odd number of stars for me okay so how this works is I'll use inj is equal to Z J is doesn't 2 I + 1 2 I + 1 means odd number so when the value of I is zero I get one for 1 I get three for two I get five five and so on for three I'll get seven if you plug three here you'll get seven so this is the odd number so we are printing Stars odd number of time 2 I + 1 will yield let me write it here 2 I + 1 will yield 1 3 5 7 9 and so on for I is equal to 0 1 2 and so on okay so this is how it works I hope I was able to explain this to you and and you were able to print this star pattern uh yourself so if you get some other star pattern in the future I hope you'll be able to print that so this was all about the star patterns the uh functions recursion we learned a lot of stuff in this chapter I hope you enjoyed this chapter let's now move on to the next chapter and we'll understand more concepts of C let's move on to chapter 6 now now before we move on to the next chapter I have a surprise for you we are going to to solve this project and this is going to be our first game if you're are new to programming this is going to be the first ever game of your life so congratulations once you complete this game you'll be able to uh showcase it to your friends or maybe you can put it inside your resume let's see what this question has to say so this project number one number guessing game says that this is going to be fun indeed we will write a program that generates a random number and ask the player to guess it so what we going to do is we are going to generate a random number and then we'll ask the user to guess it so let us say I'm generating a random number between 1 to 100 and I ask you to guess it let us say the number is 50 uh you you might guess 60 or 80 or 90 the actual number is 50 now what will happen is if the player's guess is higher than the actual number so let us say you guess 66 the number was 50 what I'll do is I'll tell you whether your guess was greater than my number or lesser than my number this will help you guess it correctly the next time so if the number is 50 and you said 66 so next time you will not say 67 or 70 for that matter because you know the number is lesser than 66 so you might give it a try and say 45 now I'll tell you that no the number is not lesser than 45 it's actually greater than 45 so you'll say okay so it's between 45 and 66 now so you might guess 49 I'll again tell you that you need to increase it and even eventually you'll reach that number you'll tell me 5050 and yes 50 will be the number so the number of guesses that you took will tell me your ability to guess a number correctly and the number of guesses you took will be your score now if somebody else has guessed it in lesser number of guess guesses he'll be the winner okay I hope that you understood what this problem is about the fun is not in the game itself to be honest it is in the code it is uh the fact that you have created the game and you are the creator of the game that you are playing that feeling that feeling of you know the creator of the game that you are playing is going to be absolutely brilliant believe me so if the player guesses the number is higher than the actual number the program will display lower number please similarly if the user's guess is low the program is going to print higher number please when the user guesses the number correctly the program displays the number of guesses the player used to arrive at the guess okay so the hint ISS use Loops use a random number generator now you might say har you didn't tell me about random number generator so what we are going to do is we are going to talk about random number generator. c how do you generate a random number in C so let me put in a boiler plate code for you and now I'll discuss about how to generate a random number in C so in order to Generate random number in C you need to include couple of libraries so the first one that we are going to include is STD Li and the other one is time. Ed now what I'm going to do is I'm going to say it number this is the number that I'm going to generate randomly and I'm going to use a function called sren and sren is going to take an unsigned integer and since I want a random integer I'll take the system time so Time Zero is a function from time. H which is going to give me a random number time the current time is going to be very random okay so why do we do this why do we say s r Time Zero because this is the seed this is the seed of my random number generator so if the seed is same I'm going to generate exactly the same random number so let me show you how to generate a random number first and then I'll come back to this asent call so all you need to do is you need to say Rand per 100 + 1 and I'll tell you the logic for this as well let me print the number for you first you'll say the number is percentage D and I'll say number okay let me run this program and show you that this actually generates a random number okay and this is going to generate a random number from 1 to 100 let me tell you since the number is 29 49 so every time you run this program you're going to get a different number between one and 100 so between this number and this number you are going to get a number okay if you if you talk about Rand function what does Rand function do you can always Google search you can say Rand in C and uh Rand is actually a function it is used us to Generate random number in the range zero to Rand Max Z is included Rand Max is not included okay so this is how random function works okay so why did we use this sren time Z let me show you what happens if I put a constant value inside sren so if I put a constant value inside sren what happens is 42 is generated if I program uh if I run this program once again once again 42 is generated if I run this program once again 42 is generated so if you put a constant inside Sr this is going to be the seed of the random number generator and for the same seed the number generated will always be the same I don't want that I want something random so that I can make this game fun so something random is a system time I can use the system time I can use time zero this will give me the system time as an integer and I can use this as my random number seat I hope the logic is clear to all of you so I can generate a random number starting from 1 to 100 okay so let us see how we can use this particular logic to program our game so let's start our game so I'll simply say game. C I'll put the boiler plate code and the very first thing that I'm going to do is I'm going to generate a random number let's do one thing let's create a function I can create a function to generate a random number but let's not do that let's keep the program simple so I'll simply say in number then I'll simply say time zero srand this is something that I'll have to do now this is the number that I have generated okay I'll create another variable I'll say guess I'll create another variable which will be number of guesses n guesses and I'll initialize n guesses with one okay so initially the number of guess that you're going to take no matter what will be one so you need at least one guess to guess the number correctly okay you cannot guess it in zero guesses obviously what I'll do is I'll use a dowi loop and why am I using doy Loop because I'm going give you one chance for sure okay so this is a very good use case of do wide Loop I'll simply say guess the number I'll say guess the number between 1 to 100 and yes back sln is important to format and I'll use scanf percentage D and I'll say am percent guess because this is going to be your guess okay now what will happen is I'll simply see if your guess is greater than the number so there are only three cases possible your guess will be either greater than the number it might be lesser than the number or it might be equal to the number so in case your guess is greater than the number I'll say lower number please and what this will do is this will tell you that you need to you you need to punch in a lower number I'll use lsf I'll say LF the number is U lesser I'll say greater number please I'll say greater number please okay now if both of these scenarios are not true what will happen is this particular L Cod code is going to run and what it will do is print F the spelling is wrong print F and let me zoom in a bit for you I'll say yay you guessed you got it okay I'll say yeah you got it in percentage D attempts or let me let me do something like this I'll say you took percentage D attempts how many attempts n guesses and every time you are guessing what I'll do is I'll increment n guesses so I'll say n guesses Plus+ okay so this is how I'll increment and guesses and this while loop will keep on running until the guess is not equal to number the moment guess becomes equal to the number I want to get out of this loop I hope the logic is very clear for you if it is not just pause the video and look at the logic you will definitely get it this is super simple logic let's try to play this game and see if this works let me save this program and close it oops uh let me save this program and close it and let me run this code and it gives me some errors I think I forgot to include the these header files the ones that I included in this one I'll replace all these header files and I'll I'll once again run this program from scratch let me close this random number generator do c and this time it compiles without any warnings so guess the number so I'll say 67 is it 67 no it says lower number please 40 okay lower number 23 lower number um let me say 12 greater number 19 oh wow you took it in one attempts which is wrong obviously I didn't I I I didn't guess it in uh one attempt so what I need to do is I need to put this out outside this else so initially it was inside the else I need to put n guesses Plus+ outside else another thing I need to do is I need to format my program such that it actually prints a new line after these lines because the program looks a bit ugly let's run this code once again and this time hopefully everything will be right 65 greater number please okay 77 lower number please okay okay that's interesting 70 greater number please 73 lower number please is it 72 yeah I got it in five attempts 1 2 3 4 and five so I got it in five attempts yes correct so my first attempt was this then second was this third fourth fifth I got it in five attempts this game was fun let me know how is this game in the comments everybody should write a comment below and tell me how was your first ever game if this was your first ever game even if it was your first ever C programming game right congratulations for all of us in the comments it's going to bring up the energy please do that please go ahead and drop in your comment do your bit let's now continue this course and move on to the next chapter so now is the time that we discussed one of the most confused topics in the C programming language and the name of the topic is pointers and I have a dedicated chapter to this topic why because this is one of the most confused topic and we are going to see how easy the concept of pointers is and you're going to appreciate it a lot so a pointer is a variable which stores the address of another variable so far we have looked into int we have looked into float we also looked into double we also looked into car which was able to store character variables now there is another type of variable which does nothing but it simply stores the address of another variable let's try to understand this okay so let us this is a variable called I what is the value inside this I it's 72 so 72 is the value stored in I I hope so far it is clear what i is I is a variable let me also open VSS code and I want to open uh this particular folder in vs code so I'll simply right click and click on open with code and I'm going to create a program called pointer. C okay I'll put in the boilerplate code here and I'll simply write in I I so the moment I say int I and the value is 72 so I'll say in I is equal to 72 what happens is in my main memory in my ram in my Random Access Memory what happens is this particular variable is stored inside some address in the memory so memory has some address just like you have a locality that locality has different houses each house has some address in a very similar way we have main memory and inside the main memory we have a lot of blocks each block has its own address try to understand this very very carefully try to listen to me very very carefully because this concept is really very important and if you listen to me I can guarantee that you going to understand so the moment I say inai is equal to 72 four bytes in Ram are reserved four bytes in memory are reserved and I will start from some address and I'll keep on going till four bytes are covered in memory and those four bytes will be used to store this integer let me try to explain I'll simply say RAM memory and I simply need some images so that uh so this is how it physically looks like but I want to show you some schematic representation of memory so that I can explain you how u a variable is stored inside a memory so let me let me Google how variable is stored okay and we should get something yes uh okay so here here here is an image that I'm going to use to explain this to you so this image is a bit blurred so we we can see this image by the way so these are nothing but blocks in the memories each block can store either zero or one and we have a lot of blocks in our memory now what happens is one block is one bit so one bit can store either zero or one now 1 2 3 3 4 5 6 7 8 eight bits will form a bite eight bits will form a bite and 1224 bytes will actually form a megabyte which is called an MB you must have heard about MB 12 Mb 30 MB 512 MB and 1024 MB is going to be 1 GB we we all use memory we all use hard disk but what happens is when we have so much of memory we can store a lot of things inside the memory but at the very basic level what a memory can store is simply a zero or a one so let us say I say in I is equal to say u in this case I said I is equal to 72 I am storing an integer and in order to store an integer I need four bytes integer is four bytes in some of the compilers it is even two bytes but let's look at an integer as four bytes for now okay so if integer is 4 bytes how much memory do I need to actually store this integer I need 1 2 3 4 I need these four rows to store an integer because one row is nothing but one bite and I need four bytes to store an integer so I need this much of Space 1 2 3 4 I need 2881 all the way till 2884 to store this integer okay now how will this integer be stored in the form of zeros and one is is another question I'm not not going to discuss that question uh just yet what we are trying to understand here is how this variable is going to store in memory now whenever we store a variable in a memory there will be some address of the memory where that variable has been stored so let us say in this case 2881 is the starting address where this integer is going to be stored I can say that this integer is stored at 2880 you can see that in I is marked 1 2 3 four bytes are marked and this int I will start from 2880 if you look at this image very carefully uh I is a variable which starts at 2880 and takes four bytes from there so 2881 is occupied 2882 is occupied 2883 is also occupied you can see that in I has been marked and these four rows have been marked which simply denotes that these four rows are holding this integer how are these holding this integer that is a question for another day uh um just understand that zeros and ones can be used to store an integer so 72 is stored in this space okay now if I say what is the address of this integer what is the address of I it's 87994 in this case it is 2880 you can see that address of I is 2880 that depends upon how compiler is storing this variable it might start the address from 2888 it might start the address from 1788 22994 it can be anything we don't have to worry about it you will get different types of addresses uh in fact different address locations on different computers as and when you run the program so in order to see the address we use am percent operator okay now I know that this might sound really very complicated to some of the people who are just starting their programming Journey but believe me you are going to understand each and everything as we move ahead towards this pointers joury okay so for now what we are doing is we are saying that I is a variable I is simply a variable it stores 72 it's an integer variable now what I'm saying is the address of I is 87994 this is for the fact okay 87994 is the address now I'm creating another variable to store this value 87994 I can create a variable to store this value 87994 is a value which can be stored in another variable will it be an integer no it will not be an integer you might argue that why why can it not be an integer but when we are storing addresses in C we simply use pointers pointer is a special kind of variable which stores address of some other variable so I holds 72 and J holds 87994 I is an integer J is an integer pointer J is an integer pointer this is something that you need to understand listen to me very very carefully this is an area where you cannot sleep you you will have to listen to me please rewind if you were sleeping while I was talking about pointers and listen to me very very carefully what pointer is so I is an integer variable J is an integer pointer integer pointer means a pointer which stores the address of an integer so J is an integer pointer so J will hold address of integers only integers okay so I can simply assign 87 994 to J and I can even assign uh address of some other integer to J and so on okay I hope you understood this much now J is a pointer and J points to I so we simply say in C language terminology that J points to I when I say J points to I it simply means that J is holding the address of I so I is holding 72 J is pointing to I pointing to I means it's holding the address of I okay I hope that this is clear so far and I was able to understand I also Creed this visual to better explain you what J points to I means you you'll be able to remember all these things uh if I create these funny visuals for you okay now let's talk about what is address of Operator %c Operator okay is this the first time we using ENT operator no we have already seen ENT operator where we looked into this ENT operator while we were talking about scan a function we discussed there that in order for scanf to work properly we need to supply the address of the variable we want to take as input from the user so we use am perent in order to take the address of a variable and Supply to scanf but let's see what this amp percent means amp percent will simply return the address of the variable So when you say in I is equal to 72 I will be located somewhere in the memory and it will hold the value 72 and wherever this I is in the memory m% I will tell me this value in this case m% I will simply return 2880 I hope that this is very clear so in order to in order to understand or rather in order to look into the address of I the address of I is percentage U and what is this percentage U yes youve guessed it right it's a special format specifier for pointers okay so I'll simply say am per I and I'll get the address of I okay let me also make this TS capital and run this program for you the moment I run this program you'll see the address of I is this so this is the address in memory which was provided to uh this particular variable I okay so I was uh stored here starting from here and it will occupy four bytes or two bytes depending upon the architect if you are uh in some other computer which uses some different architecture integer might be two bytes there okay so this is something that you need to remember you you you don't have to memorize that integer is four bytes and it cannot be two bytes it can be two bytes it can be 4 bytes that depends upon the architecture okay now coming back to the notes the address of operator is used to obtain the address of a given variable so address of operator address off is an operator which is nothing but am percent this am percent is used to obtain the address of a given variable so if I was to obtain the address of a given variable I'll use amp person just like this okay now for different variables this will give different addresses so if I have in J is equal to something let me say in J is equal to 723 and percentage U and I'll say m person J the address of I and J is this and this so the address of I is this and address of j is this so this is how address of I and J can be returned using a c program okay so far so good I hope you understood uh how we can take the address of a given variable and print it on the console format specifier for printing pointer addresses percentage you we have seen format specifier for integers which was percentage D we saw format specifiers for floating Point numbers perc for we saw it for double we saw it for a lot of other variables you can even Google for format specifiers but percentage U is something that you need to remember just like you remember percentage D for integers you need to remember percentage U for the pointers now just like we saw ambers and operator we look into a star operator and this is something that might confuse you but I'm going to make it as simple as possible for you and if you listen to me very very carefully I can give you a guarantee 100% guarantee that you will understand this because when I started learning this I was very confused so I can tell you that how your confusion can be removed and what are the things that will confuse you listen to me very carefully the value at address or Star operator is used to obtain the value present at a given memory address so it's kind of an inverse of ERS operator let me tell you how so if you have a variable I and you have the value stored inside the variable 72 and you use am% operator you'll get to address what if I give you the address and I want you to tell me what is the value stored at this address so if I hand you 87994 and then I ask you tell me the value stored inside this address how will you tell me which value is stored inside this address you might say I don't know I don't know I cannot look into the memory I cannot open the screws of my laptop and look into the memory and read which values there you cannot read but you can always write a program and I'll show you how that is done so just like we have ERS operator to get the address we have star operator to decode that address and get the value at that address so if I enclose this with with with a star let me show you so if I say star of m% of I and star of m% of J let me show you something star means value at address of I value at address of I let us say you are living alone at your house inside your room and let us say your house number is 24 what if I say house number of Harry and the person inside it so if I ask you person inside house number 24 of Harry what will happen who will be that person it will be Harry okay so you know a very similar way if I say value at address of I it will be I what is the value 72 in in a very similar way value at address of j will be J so let me change this value of I andj is I'll say percentage D percentage D okay so value of I andj will be printed using this definitely you will never use this kind of concept to you know print the value of I you will simply use percentage D and I to print I but just in case you are given a question and you are asked what will this Line Print in a c program you should be able to answer okay so if I run this program and if I show you the value of I and J is 72 and 723 let me write a back slash and and beyy this so if I save this program and if I run this you'll see the value of I andj 72 and 723 and the address 220 and 216 Okay so so these are the addresses which were allocated to I and J and 72 and 723 were the values so I hope you understood am percent and star operators M percent is address of and star means value at okay so this this was pretty simple so far and if you listen to me carefully definitely you should have understood how these things work okay so the image that we were talking about uh I I I clicked on this image and I opened this uh I I don't know which link is this where is this coming from but I gave it a red and it was actually good and it will make you understand how computer memory works so just in case you want to Deep dive into computer memory and look into how memory works I think you can use this resource because I I gave it a read and uh it it really explains it well so let me paste this link for you here I'll write a comment here you can click here and you can go to this particular page and yes it is good uh now we'll move on uh further and talk about the further Concepts okay so now that you know what ERS operator is what star operator is we look into how to declare a pointer how is a pointer declared so a pointer is declared using the following synx so this is a centax which we can use to declare a pointer in Star J so do not confuse a star with this value at address operator when I say in Star J I'm simply saying that J is a point poter that's it now this might be very confusing for you because you you'll tell me that hey harry you just told me that star means that decode this address and give me the value of this and you are saying that inst starj can be used to create pointers so yes let me show you something creating pointers let me add boiler plate code let us say I want to create a variable which is going to store address of an integer so if I say in I is equal to 72 now let us say I want to create a variable which will store the address of I so if I do something like this in J is equal to m% i j is an integer I cannot store address as an integer in C in order to store the address I'll have to create a special kind of variable which is a pointer variable and in order to mark this J as a pointer when I Mark J as pointer I I'm simply saying that J Will now store address of some integer when I say int J I'm saying that J Will store an integer when I say int star J I'm saying that J Will store address of an integer so if I say int star J is equal to ENT I it simply means that J is a variable which holds the address of I now I can do something like this now I can say that the value of I is percentage D and what I can do is I can say star J okay so the moment I say star J what it means is it means that decode the value at address J okay so if I run this program I'll get the value of I is 72 let me show you another example and also I'll add a back so that things look good uh if I say value or other address of I is percentage U and I simply say J so J is nothing but address of I so when I say int star J is equal to to m% I it simply means that J will now hold address of I now this might seem really very complicated to some of the people who try to map uh you know the the use of the star operator with Declaration of a pointer this is a pointer declaration and star when used with a variable simply means what is the value at this address okay so this is something that you nearly need to wrap around your head now the address of I is this the value of I is this what else is the value of I I can simply write I this will also give me the value of i j will give me the address of i m percent I will give me the address of I so I can say percentage u m percent I this will give me the address of I I can say percentage U and directly J since I have used a pointer variable and I've said in start J is equal to mcent I this will give me the address of I this will give me the value of I because what I'm doing is I'm using value at operator and I'm simply using J and I can also say the value of I is percentage di this will also give me the value of I now if you come back to the notes you'll find out that I have told you how to declare a pointer here so a pointer is declared using the following syntaxes what I've written here int star J declare a variable J of type in pointer you can simply declare an integer pointer by typing in Star J So when you say in star J J will be an integer pointer now you can use J is equal to m i to assign the address of I inside this J we have we have already seen this in the program and once you run this program you'll understand a lot of things I've written those things in the notes as well so store address of I in J using this just like pointer of type integer we also have pointers of type character loow double you can have pointers to any data type now we'll also learn about custom data types in later chapters and you can even have pointers to those custom data types but let's start easy and let's look into integer pointer character pointers and Float pointer so when I say inst star chptr this can be any name I'm using chptr this is pointer to an integer if I say Car Star chpd it's pointed to a character because I have written car here now if I say float star chpd it's pointer to a float because I've written a float here okay in Star chpd C star ch PDR float star chpd now what happens is a lot of students they get confused with the name of the variable you should never look and rely on the name of the variable so if the variable name says amount of sugar in coffee that doesn't mean that the amount of sugar that that person has drank in his coffee in the morning uh will be same as the value of that variable people will write anything in their programs and it's your duty to verify whether a given point poter is a character pointer integer pointer or a float pointer merely naming a variable as chptr doesn't make it a character pointer what exactly that variable is matters okay so I've written the same thing here I'm I'm saying here that although it's a good practice to use meaningful variable names we should be very careful while reading and working on programs from fellow programmers so if you are working uh on programs from your fellow programmers who have written some code and you want to make sure that whatever they have written is right or not you need to verify from the ground truth and not from the name of the variable in this case if you say that this is a character pointer it will be wrong because it's an integer pointer I have used in Star simply naming a variable as chptr doesn't make it a character simply naming a variable as character one doesn't make it a character you should verify whether it's an integer whether it's an integer pointer or some other type of variable so I hope you got this point now I have a program to demonstrate pointers I have already demonstrated you pointers using this program but I have written this program in the notes as well let's try to see what this program is doing so int I is equal to 8 simply assigns the value 8 to this variable I and when I say int star J I'm simply creating a pointer which is an integer pointer and the name of that variable is J now I can assign address of an integer inside this J by doing J is equal to m i so this J will now hold the address of this this variable which is I okay so what will happen if I say print F address I is equal to percentage u m percent I percentage you m percent I will print the address of I in a similar way since J stores the address of I what we can do is we can simply say address of I is equal to percentage U Back sln and J what this will do is this will also print the same thing as this this will print the address of I but what if I print the address of j now J is also a variable it's it's a pointer variable what is J J is something which stores the address of I does it has its own address yes it does it does has its own address now this is something that gets confusing to some of the people so let us say I have this variable 72 it is stored at address 87994 if I say address of I this is the address of I but if I create another variable J and I store the address of I inside this variable this in itself is a variable which will have some other address so address of address also exists so this is a variable I it has this address this is a variable J which is a pointer which means that J is made to store the address of integers this will also has its own address which is 87998 okay so in a very similar way when I say m per J this will be some other another address and it will be address of J's J is a variable at the end of the day J is a variable it is a pointer variable which stores the address of an integer variable but at the end of the day it in itself is a variable so when I say something like this I'm perc J this will print address of j in a very similar way I can print value of I just like the traditional way I can also say m percent I and wrap it uh and put a star operator which will decode the value by using the address and this will also print the value of I in a very similar way this will also print the value of I because J is nothing but amp percent J is nothing but address of I and if I decode this address if I find the value at this address this will give me the value of I so this program will return this this is the address of I this is the address of I this is the address of j which is storing the address of I but at the end of the day J is a variable it will have some address so this is the address of j and the value of i is8 as we have already seen so type this program inside your Visual Studio code and see um C see this output okay now uh what we'll do is uh we'll talk about Pointer to a pointer so this program sums it all you if you understand it you have got the idea of pointers so make sure that you understand this program because I don't think you need anything else to understand pointers in case you haven't understood what pointers are you need to watch this chapter once again it means you are not paying attention if you have paid attention and you've listened to me carefully and if you have coded along with me I can give you 120% guarantee that you will understand what pointers is this is the amount of confidence that I have in myself now pointer to a pointer just like J is pointing to I or storing the address of I we can have another variable K which can further store the address of j what will be the type of K tell me it will be pointer to an integer pointer okay so let's let let's try to understand this and in order to create this pointer to an integer pointer I'll have to put double star so in Star J simply means that J is a pointer to integer in star star J or rather in star star k will mean that K will store address of an integer pointer okay and we can take this chain as long as possible but in most of the cases you will not see pointer to a pointer you'll definitely see pointers but even pointer to a pointers are very rare but we need to understand this let us say I created a variable I I stored 72 I has a value 72 this I will hold some address in memory what is the type of I it's an integer I've done nothing so far I've simply created an integer I and assigned a value 72 to it now if I say in Star J and if I store the address of I inside J what is the type of J it's in start which means pointer to an integer this variable this J variable stores address of an integer and it will definitely have its own address in memory since it storing in memory it will have some address in memory what is that address let us assume that that address is 87998 now what I want to do is I want to go a step further and I want to create a variable K which will further store the address of j what will be the type of this variable it will be in star star in star star means pointer to a pointer of an integer so pointer to an integer pointer so this is pointer to a pointer okay so K will store address of something which was storing address of an integer okay so we simply denote it as a in triple sorry in double star and this in itself will also have some address and we can have another variable K uh sorry L which will store this address and we'll have to write in Triple Star but again that is very rare and you don't have to you know think that much we can go even further one level and create a variable L of type in Triple Star to store the address of K we mostly use in star in in most of the cases you will encounter pointers even pointer to a pointer is sometimes um you can see in real world programs but it's very rare in Triple Star is really very rare okay but again you need to understand that pointer is not nothing but a variable it's simply a variable which stores address of another variable I hope you understood what pointer is now we going to look into the two types of function calls which is call by value and call by reference this is something that you'll definitely need when you are programming in c and this is something that you're going to encounter a lot of times even if you're writing a c program with even a little bit of complexity you are going to look into these types of function calls so it gets really very important for us to understand what these types of function calls are so based on the way we pass arguments to the function function calls are of two types call by value and call by reference you must be thinking we have already looked into functions and function calls but let me tell you something you can either pass the value of arguments or you can pass the address of the arguments let me tell you what it means let's talk about call by value so 03 uncore uhu it's called call by value do C call by value. C let me put the boiler plate code and what I'm going to do right now is I'm going to say in sum in int and this is a function that's going to return an integer and it's going to take two integers so all I need to do here is I'll say int a and then int B and then I'll say return a + b and this is my function pretty straightforward okay what I'll do do is I'll say print F I'll simply say the value of A+ B is and I'll say percentage D and what is my percentage D it's sum say 3 comma 6 and if I run this program you can see the value of a plus b is 9 nothing surprising so far what if I have two variables here I'll say int X is = 5 in y is = 4 and I'll simply say x comma y now if I do something like this and if I run this you can see that the value of a + b is 9 so it's simply adding five and four so how how does this work let's try to understand how this works so whenever we are giving a function called like this Su X comma Y what happens is that X and Y both of these values they are passed to this particular function sum so X is is five and Y is four so five and four are copied into a and b I'll repeat this for you the values X Y which are nothing but five and four are copied into a and b so a becomes five and uh B becomes four okay so now this function will return return 5 + 4 which is 9 so basically what happens is when when I say in sum in a in b a will be equal to this value and B will be equal to this value and a will simply be assigned whatever the value of x is B will simply be assigned whatever the value of y is so we are creating a copy of X and Y so will X and Y be changed what if I say uh the value of X and Y is uh X and Y is let me make it X and Y I I wrote it as a and b but let me write it X and Y is percentage D and once again I'll say percentage D and I'll simply say X comma y because I want to I want to print the values of X and Y so I'll save this program and I'll also use back sln so that I can see a new line after this so the moment I run this you can see the value of x + 5 is 9 x + y is 9 and the value of X and Y is 5 and 4 okay now what if I do something like this I'll say a is equal to say 56 can I do something like this let's try to run this program when I try to run this program you can see the value of x + y is 60 but the value of X and Y is 5 and 4 what is happening in this program let's try to understand let's try to dissect this program you'll see that the value of x is five here and value of y is 4 here and when I say the value of x + y is percentage D basically 5 and four are copied into a and b so a is five and B is four but here I've changed the value of a so now a is 56 and B is 4 initially a was 5 b was 4 but now a is changed to 56 B is unchanged which is 4 so 56 + 4 will be 60 but since the values X and Y were copied the copy of X and Y were changed so X and Y will remain unchanged so X and Y will be nothing but 5 and four because I cannot change one function's value from other function directly I can do this directly I can't say a is equal to 56 and get this reflected here that doesn't happen but this is the normal scenario this is called call by Valu we have already seen this scenario we were just understanding how the scenario works so if you come back to the nodes you'll see based on the way we pass arguments to the function function calls are of two types call by value and call by reference call by value means sending the values of argument call by reference means you are sending the address itself now let's talk about this one what happens when I'm sending the address itself now let's talk about call by value here the value of the arguments are passed to the function we have seen this this is a normal scenario you can consider this example when I say in C is equal to sum 3A 4 uh 3 is copied as X and Y is copied to sorry four is copied to y u and simply what happens is uh the sum is defined as sum in a in B these two values are copied into a and b and the values three and force are copied to A and B now even if we change a and b nothing happens to the variables X and Y we have seen this we have seen this here nothing happens to X and Y okay why why because I cannot change the copy this A and B are different variables X and Y are different variables when I say sum X comma y the value of x will be copied to a and value of y will be copied to B and now if I change a and b it has nothing to do with X and Y I hope you got this one now uh in C we you usually make a call by value so far we have made call by value now listen to me very carefully call by reference this is something new this is something that we have not seen so I'm going to write a program to describe call by reference so let me say something like this I'll say uh call by reference. C I'll put the boiler plate code and what I'll do is I'll simply copy this program and I'll paste it now in call by reference listen to me very carefully and then we'll go back to the notes and see what is there in the notes instead of sending the values we send the address of the values listen to me very carefully instead of send sending the values we send the address so if I do something like this m perc X and M perc y if I do something like this and accept these addresses here so I can say in Star a now a is an address B is an address because we are passing an address so a this is an address this is an address so this has to be be an address this has to be an address and what what type of address integer address so it can be an integer pointer and uh this is a is an integer address so integer address will be passed into this variable which is an integer pointer is this valid definitely this is valid you you can definitely um use this kind of syntax to pass the address of X and Y variables okay so far so good so far so good now in order to change the value of a what will I do a is an address a is an address so I'll decode this value I'll say star a is equal to 56 I'll say value at address of a is 56 and I'll simply say value of a plus value of B okay now the sum function will definitely work but my question to you is will the value of X and Y change a very simple question in front of you and then we'll try to see what what happens and why this thing happens okay I want you to write down comments and tell me what will happen will the value of X and Y be changed if you have commented uh well and good if you said that it will not be changed listen to me very carefully you are wrong it will be changed the value of X and Y will now be 56 and 4 how come this function was able to change the value of x we'll see let me run this program for you and show you that actually the value will be change so it is saying conflicting types for some okay I'll have to say in Star and star here my bad I'll have to pass um the pointers in the Prototype and you can see the value of x + y is 60 and now the value of X and Y is 56 and 4 so the value of x actually changes why does this happen so let me try to explain this to you using a whiteboard okay so let me show you something so let us say this is the main memory of my computer this is the main memory of my computer and let us say this red region this red region is variable X so this region contains variable X okay and let us say this green region this contains variable y okay now let us say the address of this is one I'm just assuming address to be one for Simplicity it's not going to look like this but let's assume the address is one here and address is two for this one so the address of X is one address of Y is 1 and the value of x is what it was uh me check five and Y was four so this was five and this was four now what happens is if I pass these addresses if I say one and two if I say take one and two and somebody says that change the value at one change the value at two this is my main memory I have one main memory I have the main memory of my computer if somebody goes to that main memory and changes the variables it will be reflected everywhere and this is what happens in call by reference instead of copying the value when I'm using call by value I'm simply copying these values I'm saying whatever is there in five and four copy it in A and B so I'm simply saying a will also be five b will also be four and now if you change these values these values these X and Y will will be unchanged but in call by reference what we are doing is we are actually taking the address of this variable itself and we are decoding this address and saying that the value at this this address must be changed and when we are doing something like that then definitely definitely this particular program will be able to change the value of X and Y now let's come back to notes and try to understand this even further so call by reference here the address of the variables is passed to the function as argument so arguments are passed before we were passing the values but now we are passing the address and now that we have the address we can alter the value at that address and value at a given address will be reflected everywhere because that is the physical value of that variable okay so when you say value at this address it it has to be changed because we are taking the address of variable X in main memory and we are changing the value at that address now since the addresses are pass to the function the function can now modify the value of a variable in calling function using ASX and ERS operators I've given an example here I've shown you how this works and this function is capable of swapping values passed to it and this is a typical function using pointers which is used to swap two variables so let me show you this logic and uh this will definitely help you understand call by reference more clearly so I'll say swap using call by reference so I'm saying swap using CBR CBR means call by reference reference remember this okay so I'll put a boiler plate code here and I'll simply say void Swap and swap will simply put the value of uh X into Y and Y into X let's see how and I'll Define my function somewhere here and also I don't need X and Y here this is a prototype I don't need X and Y so I'll simply do this now I'll simply say int a is equal to 5 and B isal to 7 uh values sorry print f u I'll say value of a and b before swap um they were percentage D and percentage D and I'll simply say a comma B and then I'll do the same thing after the swap what happens after the swap uh so let me put back sln here and I'll simply run swap I'll say swap a comma B so let's see the first scenario here when I say swap A and B what I can do is there is a very simple swapping logic let me tell you I'll simply create a temporary variable I'll say the value at a but the value at temp will be equal to B the value of sorry the value of temp will be equal to a the value of a will be equal to B and the value of B will be equal to Temp so what will this do this will simply create a temporary variable and store the value of a so at this line the value of a is equal to uh 5 the value of temp is equal to 5 and the value of B is equal to 7 okay so I'm going to do the dry run of this program for you now when I say A is equal to B basically I'm assigning the value of B into a so the value of a is 7 temp + 5 and b is 7 at this line now the moment the control comes to this line the line number 18 I'm saying B is equal to Temp so what is there in the temp will come into B and you can see the value of B is five now so using this what I've done is the a was five b was seven I made a as 7 B as five so this is a typical logic to swap two integers but there is a catch here there is a catch here let me show you what that catches let me print these values right after this function runs and right before this function runs so when I talk about this function inside this function I'll be able to swap so let me show you I'll I'll comment these two lines I'm simply running swap a comma B and I'm trying to swap it inside the function so when I look at these two variables from inside this function the variables will be swapped let me show you um it says b is Undeclared let me see okay so I need to use a and b here I wrote X and Y um okay now it should work so the value of a and b before the swap uh okay before the swap before the swap will be uh 5 and 7 and after the swap it will be 7even and five okay so when I look at these two variables from inside the function I was able to swap the values but what will happen if I look at these two values from from the main function in the main function the value of a and b will remain unchanged because we are passing the values of A and B by value when we pass by value a copy of these two variables will be made inside this function and the values of A and B inside the main function will remain unchanged also note that I have used a and b in the main function as well and I've used the same nomenclature of these variables in the swap function as well and it's totally okay to do that swap will maintain a separate copy of A and B and Main will maintain a separate copy of A and B so if I run this program you can you can see the value of a and b before swap 5 and 7 after swap 5 and 7 it doesn't swap the values A and B so what to do if I want to swap the values A and B in the main function I will have to pass the addresses of A and B addresses of these two variables literally I'll have to pass address of this particular variable and then I'll have to pass address of this particular variable and then what will happen is I'll be able to change these two variables let me show you let me show you how this can be done okay so what I'll do is I'll accept pointers inside my swap function and I'll simply say inst star a and star B so A and B are now addresses now that A and B are addresses I'll have to use the values by using the SX operator which is nothing but value at address operator so value at this particular address will be star a value of B will be star B value of U this particular will be uh let let me call it aptr so that you are easily able to understand that this particular a PTR is the pointer to this a okay it'll be easy for you you can name the variables whatever you want but I'm just trying to make things easy for you to understand so I'll also make it B PTR B PTR and let me show you that this changes the values um A and B to b and a so I've said instar it said instar but argument is of type in um install bbtr okay so I'll have to say m perc a m perc B I'll have to pass the addresses of A and B and now this will swap the values no surprises whatsoever so five and seven 7 and five okay why why did this happened because we passed the address of the variable so when we pass the address of the variable what happens is we can find the value of that variable using star operator so this particular a can can be called by using star a this address is passed to swap and not the exact value is copied to swap previously we were copying the value of a to swap now we are copying the address but when we use Asis operator Asis at that address will literally be this variable and it will be changed okay so this is how call by reference works I hope that you are able to understand how call by reference works and how these things are used in C programming language so if I come back to the notes I've written the same thing that function is capable of swapping the values passed to it because we are now using pointers we are now using the addresses and we are decoding those addresses to find the value at those addresses and we are altering those values at that address so we are literally able to change the variables of the main function so I hope that you were able to understand all this this finishes a chapter number six I hope you had fun this was one of the most important chapters of the C programming language I hope that you were able to understand and even if you have to you know watch this chapter more than once feel free to do that it's worth it watch it once more and make sure you read the notes more than once because these are the concepts that will definitely see these concepts are famous for being difficult but actually they are not difficult because if you understood all the things that I taught you all the things that I told you all the concepts of am person operator star operator you'll be able to understand it's not like this is something that that is difficult for people to understand it's just that it takes time if you don't have the right resource but I hope that I was able to explain this to you pretty well so we'll now move on to chapter six practice set and solve some questions let's move on to chapter 6 practice set now all right so now that we have some concept of pointers in our head let's try to solve some of the questions uh on pointers so the very first problem of this chapter six practice set says that write a program to print the address of a variable use this address to get the value of that variable so this is a pretty simple program let me show you and let me code this for you so I'll simply say pr01 doc I'll put in the boilerplate code and what I'll do is I'll simply say in I is equal to 3 and what I'll do is I'll simply use print F and then I'll simply use the address of I is and I'll use personent U and I'll say m% I because we know that the m% operator is going to give us the address of I okay so let's try to run this so This prints the address of i as this so now that we have the address of I we can actually find the value of I so I can say value of I is percentage D and what I can do is I can simply say star % I and what this will do is it will find out the value at address % I which is value at the address of I which is nothing but the value of I so it's going to print three which is why I have used a percentage D here so I'll save this program I'll run this program and you can see the value of I is three and also just to format a programs nicely what we'll do is we'll use these back slns and um let me come back to the practice set so this problem is done pretty straightforward simple problem write a program to print the address of a variable we printed the address of the variable we also used this address to get the value of this variable using the asteris operator let's look into the question number two write a program having a variable I so this program is going to have a variable I and will print the address of I now we going to pass this variable to a function and print its address are these addresses the same y so let's see uh what this problem is asking us to do so I'll say 07 pr02 py uh oops I I meant c not py so this is C programming course not Python Programming course my bad C boiler plate code and um what I'll do is I'll start this template I'll use this template to start with and what I'll do is uh this question set write a program having variable I we already had variable I which is why I used that uh program for this question as well now print the address of I so we are printing the address of I yes we are doing that indeed so this part is done now we have to pass this variable to a function and print its address so in order to pass this to a function what we'll do is we'll create that function we'll say funk and then we'll say instar so Funk is a function which returns an integer and it takes a pointer so I'll say in Star PTR and I'm not sure about the return value of this funk but for now I've written Funk uh sorry int but I'll change it uh if need be so what I'll do is I'll see what this uh function say so we have to print its address in the functions so let me do one thing let me change this to void because I don't want to return anything back from this function so what this function says is simply print the address PTR so I'll simply say say uh the value of address PTR from function Funk is I'll say percentage U and I'll simply print PTR and as part of the best practice what I'll do is uh I'll use back sln at the end of the line so that all the things are formatted very nicely with the new lines printed so we are passing the address to a function so let me uh call this function and let me give ERS I to this function so this function uh takes the address of I and it simply prints that address of I just like this okay let's see what it prints so the question says that will the address which is printed by the function and the address which is printed by the main be the same will it be the same so are these addresses same which addresses we have to pass uh we have to print the address of I in the main function and then we have to pass the address of I to the funk and we'll have to print that address inside the funk to see whether the addresses will be same or not do you want to guess whether the addresses will be same or not I want you guys to guess in the comments uh leave the Tim stamp so that I can know which question you are answering in which comment and post your answer I want all of you to post your answers and I'll wait for um for you all to you know post post your comment I hope everybody posted the comment so the answer is yes these addresses are going to be the same because this value and the value we are passing to this function is the address of I is the address of this particular variable in the main memory which is going to be the same so let me run this program for you and show you that these addresses are going to be the same so this value and this value is going to be the same so this is the value which we printed from the function and this is the value which we printed from or main so this is how uh this question was structured this is what it wanted to tell you that uh the address of I is going to be the same in the function as well as in the main in fact main is also the function when I say function I mean this fun function the function that we created that user defined function that we created coming back to the practice set the third question says that write a program to change the value of a variable to 10 times of its current value write a function and pass the value by reference so this problem says that create a function pass the address of a variable to that function and change its value so let's start from this function itself let me uh create the eighth program I'll say 08 pr03 Doc and what I'll do is I'll copy this particular program and I'll start from here now I'll rename my funk as change because it better reflects what this function is doing so I'm simply saying void change in Star and inside this function what I'm doing is I'll simply say value at this address is equal to value at this address multiply by 10 because we have to change the value to 10 times the value of um of the variable okay so let me run this function so I'll say the value of I uh let me remove this I'll say value of I before uh change ran is and I'll say after change then is and let me also call change with the address of I and U let me not use this fancy syntax let me straightforward uh say I so I'll simply say I I don't want to use this fancy syntax um star of SX of I which is going to be the same as I but I just want to use this clean synex I so let's see if the value changes so the value was three and it is now 10 * of three which is 30 what if the value is six it should be 60 after the function change runs yes it is 60 let's see if this works for some um larger value like 676 yes it does let's see if it works for zero yes it should and it will because 10 * of 0 is 0 what is 10 10 * of 30 it's 300 so we should get 300 and we are getting 300 so this is how we can pass by reference to a function and change the value uh of a variable inside that function without actually having to have that variable inside this function so did you notice one thing this I was inside the main function this variable I was inside the main function but it was changed by a function which is totally different from Main how using the addresses so if you get the address of a variable you can even change it from some other function so this is what this problem teaches you coming back to the practice set and question number four says write a program using function which calculates the sum and average of two numbers so you have to create a function which can calculate sum and average of two numbers use pointers and print the values of sum and average in main so this program says that you have to use pointers and you have to print the values of sum and address of two numbers so we have to use pointers and then we'll have to print the value of sum and average in main so this is a very interesting problem and I want you to pay attention so we are going to create a program called 09 pr03 uh pr04 I guess yes do c and what I'm going to do is I'm going to use this as boiler plate code or let me write it from scratch I want to write it from scratch so what I'll do is I'll say int average and sum this is the name of a function and what I'll do is I'll take two pointers inside this function and you'll ask me why am I doing this I'll answer you I'll answer you shortly but for now just assume that it is required for us to take two pointers inside this function also I'll U remove these from here because this is function prototype this is the function body so let us say the numbers are A and B so I'll simply say uh int a is equal to 6 let me call it float because we are um we are actually calculating the average and I want some sort of precision so I'll make it float and this as float two and what I'll do is I'll simply pass the address of a and address of B to average and sum now what happens is this average and sum function will take the values a b as well as the address of two more variables which are C and D so I have created two additional variables C and D now let me explain you what I'm going to do so I'm going to add int int as well and I'm going to take the value of uh sorry uh I I meant float so I'll say float a float B let me make it float because we are dealing with the floating Point numbers okay and Float here as well so we are going to deal with float pointers now what I'll do is I'll say call this function with the values A and B and also with two pointers which are nothing but the address of c and address of D so listen to me carefully now what I've done is I've passed the value 6 and 423 which is going to get copied inside this a and this B and also what I'm doing is I'm passing the address of c and I'm passing the address of D to this function why am I passing the address I'm passing the address so that I can update these two variables which are C and D from this function so I'll set C to the average and I'll set D to the sum to make things more clear let me call this float sum and Float AVG so I'll pass the address of sum and address of AVG so that I can update sum and AVG variables from this function now listen to me what I'll do is I'll simply say the value at ptr1 which is nothing but the Val value of sum should be equal to a + b and the value at ptr2 should be equal to a + b / 2 which is nothing but the average and now here I can print the value of sum is percentage F and the value of average is percentage F so I'll simply say sum and I'll simply simply say AVG and I can print the values of sum and address which are set using this function so did you get it we are not returning anything from this function let me return void from this function we not returning back anything from this function but what we are doing is we are essentially setting the values of sum and average from this function I hope that you understood this let's see if the program works so it says the value of sum is 429 which is correct because is 423 + 6 is 429 and the value of average is 24.5 so if you add these numbers it'll turn out to be 429 and if you divide 429 by 2 it'll turn out to be 24.5 how was this program let me know in the comments was this something that you saw for the first time in your programming career uh or was it something that you have seen before uh if if you are a c beginner or programming beginner for that matter this is something that you might have seen for the first time and you should definitely appreciate the power of pointers see we didn't even pass sum and AVG we simply passed the addresses of sum and AVG to this function and these addresses were captured inside ptr1 and ptr2 and the values at ptr1 and ptr2 were updated inside this function I'm not returning anything from this function directly I'm not returning anything from this function but indirectly I'm kind of returning something from this function what is that I'm setting the values of variables in the main function from this function so this program is actually very important mark this program as important and if you haven't understood what we did in this program I want you to watch this question once again coming back to the practice set and to the question number five write a program to print the value of a variable I by using pointer to pointer type of variable so uh what we'll do is uh we'll simply write a program uh which uses pointers to pointers so let's write a program which uses this pointers to pointers so this is 10th program problem number five 10or p05 Doc and I'll put in the boilerplate code so I is a variable it has three inside of it let me create a pointer one I'll say it's an integer pointer which contains the address of I uh so far so good I'll say I want a pointer to pointer which is ptr2 which contains the address of ptr1 so ptr1 is a pointer variable and its address is stored inside ptr2 which is a pointer to pointer variable so ptr1 is a pointer variable ptr2 is a pointer to a pointer okay now let me show you something what is the value of I yes it's it can be printed this way but uh no surprises this will print the value of I what's new I'll show you what's new in fact not even new because we have already talked about all these Concepts in the chapter so I can uh say the value of I is star ptr1 can I say this or not why can I say this why is the value of I star ptr1 ptr1 is simply storing the address of I ptr1 holds the address of I and since pd1 holds the address of I I can always dreference ptr1 and I can say star p R1 and star ptr1 will give me the value at this address which is the address of I so what is the value add the address of I it's the value of I which is three now I can also say the value of I is star of star of ptr2 okay so I can actually write ptr1 as star of ptr2 can I do this yes I can do this I can always do this because ptr1 can be written as star ptr2 now if you if you haven't understood why this is the case try to map this with why the value of I was star ptr1 then you'll be able to understand why the value of ptr1 is star ptr2 and if I run this program let me show you all these uh lines will print the value of I is three I can also get rid of this the these parenthesis and this will actually print the same thing so this is how we can print the value of I using pointer Direct Value pointer to a pointer okay I hope you understood this so this was simply the question which was created by me to explain you pointer to pointer variable so problem number six now says that try to attempt problem number three using call by value and verify that it doesn't change the value of the set variable so what was problem number three uh problem number three was um let Let's see we solv problem number three so let's create a program and we'll copy the code of problem number three so I'll say 11 uncore 11 uncore P um pr06 doc I'll put the boiler plate code in in fact I'll not put the boiler plate code I'll copy the problem number three and I'll paste it inside problem number six so problem number six is talking about problem number three it says that what if we use call by value instead of reference it simply says that you are actually passing the address of I what if you actually pass I and not the address of I so what if I do something like this and let me not even call it pointer in that case because it's not a pointer and what if I do something like this I'll say I is equal to I * 10 can I do this yes obviously I can do this but it's not going to change the value of I inside main function let me show you so if I run this program you'll see the value of I before uh change ran is 30 and even after change R it is 30 uh we were expecting it to be 300 because we are actually changing the value of I to be I mtip by 10 why does this program not work why did this uh fail to update the value of I this happened because what we are doing here is we are simply saying in I is equal to 30 now we are printing the value of 30 now we are passing a copy of I to change function a copy will be passed so if I have this keyboard and I create copy of this keyboard and I distribute it to my friend and he breaks the keyboard will this keyboard also get broken no it will not get broken because why why why will this keyboard get broken so if you are buying two iPhones one for your friend one for yourself and your friend actually throws the iPhone um inside um inside say Inside the Fire and he burns his iPhone will your iPhone also get burned obviously not so this this is why the value of I is not changed inside the main function but if I'm passing the address or if I'm giving the reference of my iPhone and I'm saying this is my iPhone and your friend actually throws your iPhone inside the fire so your iPhone will get burned I hope that this analogy makes sense I know this is funny but again I hope that it it will help you in some way to understand all these Concepts so with that said the chapter number six is finished so we'll move now to the next Concepts and we'll explore C programming language even further so now that we have completed so many concepts of C programming language we are going to look into arrays what exactly is an array an array is a collection of similar elements and this is really very important these elements have to be similar because you cannot add an integer and a character inside an array but since we just started out I don't want to confuse you I'll show you some of the very basic uh syntax of uh arrays and then we'll raise the bar from there so let's get started with what an array is so sometimes you might want to store marks of say 100 students how will you do that you might be tempted to create 100 variables saying Marks One marks 2 marks 3 marks 4 but C programming language provides you a very elegant way of doing the same thing what is that elegant way you can add uh all the marks of 100 students inside one variable which is nothing but an array collection of similar items in this case the marks of students let me give you a very brief idea of what array is I'll say 01 underscore array Basics do c I'll put in the boiler plate code I'll zoom in a bit at close the Explorer and let me show you what an array so if I do something like this uh this is a syntax of writing an array so basically it's a single variable and it's capable of storing multiple values so I just gave you an example of marks let us say you want to store 100 marks and you want to store 100 marks of 100 students with RW number ranging from say 1 to 100 you might want to store all these values inside one single variable instead of um storing it in 100 variables because creating 100 variables might be very cumbersome task you cannot do that and even if you are able to create 100 elements it will be really very difficult for you to create thousand uh variables for thousand elements or say 10,000 or one uh 1 million variables for 1 million values you got the point so what is the syntax of creating an array so let us say I want to store marks of marks of 30 students or let me make it uh uh eight students because 30 is just too much okay so I can do something like this I can say in A1 in A2 then A3 then A4 then A5 then A6 then A7 you must be thinking what I'm doing here but I'm trying to create eight variables for storing marks of eight students so these are eight variables and all of these eight variables will store marks of eight students um I can do something like this I can say A1 is equal to this and then I can say A6 is equal to say uh 87 and so on I I can assign marks to these variables but there's a better way and let me tell you what that better way is so I'll say better way and and a better way to store marks of eight students is something like this you create an array you say a and you simply say the number of values you want to store and that's it that's it and how do you store uh or rather assign marks let me assign marks for all the variables let me make it uh 49 I'm just taking random values for a182 A3 A4 A5 A6 and so on um I I could have actually added values here itself but again um I just want to show you how this maps to the better way of storing marks so let me say 37 and let me say 67 for A8 okay here what I'll do is I can actually start accessing all these variables starting from index zero now this is important here I started writing A1 A2 A3 all the way till A8 but here instead of doing this A1 is equal to 78 and let me copy copy this so that I can actually show you how this really maps and I'll press alt shift on my keyboard alt and shift I'm pressing together on my keyboard and I just just clicked here and I'm getting all the cursors this way so what I'll do is I'll put in this square bracket and I'll use arrow keys and once again I'll put another square bracket now this is a syntax this is part of the syntax uh if you don't know how the syntax works you might want to manually do this if this is not supported by your code editor if you're using some other code editor other than Visual Studio code your editor might not support this type of syntax and in that case what you will do is you can simply uh use you know manually put all these uh square brackets now I can do something like this but this doesn't directly map to this now you must be thinking that we can uh say A1 A2 A3 A4 A5 A6 A7 A8 let me let me show you let me run this program for you I'll get rid of this part I'm getting rid of this part because this part is going to throw an error I'll tell you why but again I can assure you that this particular syntax is correct and uh we can actually run this so let me enable code Runner I think I disabled code Runner uh so code Runner is by default disabled I want to enable it in this workspace and I'll run this code and this code is not throwing any error which means we are good and this code works so what I'll do now is um I'll simply say is 1 is equal to 45 and I'll I'll show you I'll run this and show you and I can keep on doing this so the problem with the syntax is instead of starting from one we actually start from zero so we start from zero and then we go from 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 so for eight variables we start from zero and we'll go all the way till 7 the numbers from 0 to 7 are actually eight numbers if you if you count it 0 to two are three numbers 0 1 and 2 0 to 4 are five numbers 0 1 2 three and four so these are five numbers so this is something that you need to uh understand and we don't start the index from one we start the index from zero so you might have heard this in the memes and in the jokes that index starts from zero counting starts from zero in most of the programming languages and that's the case with c as well so we do something like this and I can actually use this variable by doing something like this I can say the value of student number zero is so we start the counting from zero and the value is going to be a0 so this is going to print uh let me also put back sln for better readability this will print 45 for me and I can do the same thing for student one student 2 3 four five six I can do this for all the students so I'll put in one here then I'll put in two here then I'll put in three here four here five here and you can print all all of these variables but um okay let me me let me do it for all the variables so I'm simply using multic cursor functionality of vs code um I'll run this and you'll see all the marks that I have assigned here are printed so I can actually use this as a single variable I can use A7 as a variable I can use A5 as a variable now we have marks of eight students at this point so this approach will actually take a lot of lines of code it will take a lot of typing if you try to create say thousand variables but if you try to create thousand variables using this approach all you need to do is you have you need to replace this eight with thousand and you can keep on using your variables as and then require also you can use a for Loop and you can assign all these values but in this case there is no way to assign values using a for Loop we'll see that we'll see that in U in this chapter itself so coming back to the arrays it's a collection of similar elements in this case it was collection of integers it can be a collection of characters it can be a collection of floating Point numbers and so on so we can create a float array we can create a car array and so on okay so an array is a collection of similar elements it's a single variable capable of storing multiple values so this is a single variable in this case the variable was a but it was actually capable of storing eight values so the syntax looks something like this you can do something like in Marx 90 this is an integer are you can store values inside marks zero marks 1 marks 2 marks 3 marks four 5 six all the way till 89 not 90 make sure uh because when we had array of size 8 the maximum index we can go up to is s and not 8 if you try to use A8 you'll get into troubles you'll get into memory leaks and all we don't want that syntax of declaring an array looks like this this is for integer array this is for character array this is for floating Point array and so on the values can now be assigned to marks are like this I've written this in the notes so that you can easily revise this in the future now there is a note here there's a side note I've written here it is very important to note that the array index starts with zero this is really very important for you to understand that if we have total of 90 elements the counting starts from zero and not from one if you start it from one we can go all the way till 90 but if you start the counting from zero you can go all the way till 89 for 90 elements you can do this you can try this for eight elements and you can start writing 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 for eight elements let me show this for you for six elements so these are six elements 1 2 3 4 5 6 but if you start the counting from zero you can only go till five and not six you can see that 0 1 2 3 4 5 because one additional space will be taken by this zero if you start the counting from one you can go all the way till six but in this case you can go all the way till five starting from zero so this is something that is very important and straightforward as well start the counting from zero and go up to n minus 1 if there are n elements so in this case if there are 90 elements you go till 89 which is n minus1 90 - 1 is 89 okay so we understood what array is how this works let's try to understand how we can assign elements to an array so elements of an array can be assigned or accessed using this and assigned using this so you can use scan I percentage D and you can say Mark zero and what this will do is this will actually uh put the value entered by the user inside Mark zero note this ERS sign we are using this you know exactly like an integer variable not even similar to an integer variable exactly like an integer variable so max Z is like an integer variable Max one is like another integer variable and we'll use m per to give the address uh so this is something which is important so this is to input first value and this is to Output first value of the array why first value because the index is starting from zero so zero is the first value one is the second value and Marx two is the third value if you count from 0 0 1 2 third value so this is something that you need to uh you know understand and put in your heads now quick quiz quick quiz for you write a program to accept marks of five students in an array and print them to the screen so let's let's solve this quick quiz this is very interesting so uh Co quiz uh oops I forgot to write do c I need to mention the extension then um then I'll come here and put the boiler plate code and what I'll do is I'll simply do it the old school way Marx one Marx 2 Marx 3 Marx 4 Marx 5 okay I'm doing it the old school wayes to show you how easy using arrays is and U how how much time it saves you you'll get a good idea of this so I'll say Max one is equal to um or ra let me use scanf function I'll say scanf percentage D and I'll say m perc Marks One and also what I'll do is I'll say print F enter the marks of student one so in order to enter the marks of student one um you'll enter it and also I'll put a back sln here let me put a back sln here so that it looks good do not forget the semicolon and now what I'll do is I'll replicate this for for students 1 2 3 4 and five so let me put two in here three here four here and we need one more which is five and this is getting cumbersome till 5 I don't know how cumbersome it will get if we have 100 or 200 students but again I'm I'm trying to do this the old school way to show you how uh how much time the arrays are using the the array is save so I can do the same thing I can uh take the values and then print them on the screen so I can do something like this uh I'll say print F the marks of the marks coded by student one is student one is percentage D okay and what is percentage D it is Marks One and let's do the same thing for uh for the five students so what I'll do is I'll simply use my ALT key and I'll keep clicking wherever I want multic cursors and then I'll say three four and five this is this is why I recommend Visual Studio code because of all these functionalities and the light code nature lightweight nature it has because even if you are on a computer with very low memory this works like a charm so let's try to run this program I'll run this program so they are flying a plane about my house I don't know why they have to fly a plane above my house every time I don't know that so let us say the marks of student one is 67 34 54 uh let's make it 87 let's make the last students marks to be 100 and you can see all the values are printed on the screen so this program works no surprises but is this the best way to do this is this the best way to achieve this and the answer is no so what I'll do is I'll I'll rename this this program to Quick quiz uncore old school so this is the old school way and now we'll use the modern approach to code this so what I'll do is quick quiz better solution so I'll say better solution. C let me put in the boiler plate code let me close this and once I close this I can actually do something like this um I can create an array so firstly what I'll do is I'll create the marks array and how many students do I need I need five students now what I can do is I can use a for Loop so I'll save this program I'll use a for Loop come on come on C language suggest me the for Loop come on you can do that I don't know why it's not suggesting me the fall Loop I'm not sure I need the snippet for fall loop I think I forgot to uh turn on the C++ extension so recently I had a lot of extensions enabled so I disabled all the extensions by default because it sometimes takes a lot of your memory so which is why I'm not getting the for Loop now I should get it so I'm getting the suggestion of for Loop I'm saying in I is equal to Z in I is equal to z i is less than five and i++ and in the code what I'll do is I'll write the same thing but I'll play a bit cloudly here what I'll do is I'll write this I'll say enter the marks of uh student percentage D and my percentage D is nothing but I so I'll say I and here what I'll do is I'll say marks I so this is something that I can do this is totally fine valid uh no surprise is there and I can use another for Loop to print the marks so I can do something like this so I can say um the marks scored by this student is this this and also instead of saying marks one I can say marks I here and instead of saying student one I can say percentage D and this percentage D maps to this I and this percentage D maps to this Max ey in a very similar way this percentage D marks to this I and scan f everything works this program should work let's try to run this program and yes it's asking me for the marks of student zero what I'll try to do is I'll try to put the same marks or let me use 34 23 then we have um 3 54 54 and then um 87 and 100 okay so you can see that this program behaves in a very similar way uh to this program and uh writing this program was 22 lines of code writing this program was actually 17 lines of code but even less than that because you know we are using a for Loop and uh we used some new lines here so if I try to get rid of all these new lines and show you you'll see that you maintaining this program is very easy so if this was 21 lines of code uh 22 lines of code this is just 13 lines of code and maintaining it is super simple because we just have two for Loops here look at this and look at this um and this program is small I mean just 22 lines of code because we have only five variables this program is capable of handling thousand variables maintaining the same lines of code so this is much better using fall loops and using arrays so many of you might think that why are we using student zero why are we not saying student one here why did we say student zero if you want student one here you can print I + 1 and actually store the value of uh student one in Mark zero student two in Marks One and so on so let me cancel this let me save this program and show you this works and this will say marks of student one is this student two is this but I'll also print i+ 1 here because I want it to go from 1 to 5 and not from 0 to 4 so I'll use I + 1 here so this program and this program will exactly run um with the same output okay so let me run this for you and let me show you I'll simply punch in some random values so you can see that the marks coded by Str one is this two is this three four five so this program works in an exactly the same way as this program uh the difference being that here the program is not maintainable I'll show you an example of how this program is not maintainable why this old school program is even more worse than it looks like so let us say I want to change the marks to uh enter the score of student let us say somebody instructed me to use the word score and not marks so I'll use oops I I'll use score I'll use score scored by student percentage D is percentage d so here I just need to change these two lines and if I run all the lines will say score instead of mask Max okay so if I do something like this uh you'll see that all the values are now saying score and not marks but if I was to change the same thing here I'll have to actually go to each and every line and change marks to score I'll have to say enter the score score now you might argue that hey harry why are you not using find and Place simply do this and change this to score but here is another problem if if I try to change this marks to score these variables will also get changed and there might be something in the program which might get changed accidentally and I might get into trouble so I don't want to write program this way okay this is the gist of it um yes I can always use some automated means to do find and replace but here the number of variables is really very uh small which is five but if you have say 20 variables or 30 variables or even uh 1,800 for that matter how will you maintain the code uh so this is why arrays are actually very useful so uh we spend quite a good amount of time in this quick quiz but I hope that you understood how this uh syntax works and why arrays are helpful okay now let's talk about initialization of an array what are the ways to initialize an array so there are many other ways in which an array can be initialized a lot of ways can can be used to initialize an array so if you look at this in cgpa 3 is equal to 9 8 and 8 this is nothing but a very quick way to initialize arrays so if you say in cgpa 3 is equal 988 it's going to say cgpa 0 is 9 cgpa 1 is 8 and it will set cgpa 2 to 8 once again so let's try the syntax let's create a program and I'm going to call this program as initialization of uh array so I'll say initialize array. C I'll put in the boilerplate code uh note that I have named this program as two and this as two as well because these are the same problems uh solved using different approaches so let's try to create an array called marks and let's try to use this syntax uh and let's say the marks is an array of three marks and let's see if the syntax works so what I'll do is I'll come back to my this syntax I'll copy this for Loop and what I'll do is I'll say simply paste this code in here and I'll simply format this like this and what I'll do now is simply I'll use a semicolon here I have made a mistake I am not using semicolon here uh which is why it was throwing some error so now what I'll do is I'll simply fix my indents and now what I'll do is I'll simply put in three a so that the value of I goes from 0 one and two and let's see if it is printing the correct values of marks so it is indeed printing the correct value of marks so I'll call it marks and not score so I'll say the marks scored by student this is this which is stent one is 34 2 is 23 3 is 53 so this is indeed printing the correct values of marks now let us try this synext let us try uh float instead of int and definitely I'll have to use percentage F instead of U this percentage D because this value will be a floating Point number make sure that this is percentage D because index is always going to be an integer okay so I'll simply make this float and let me see if these values are working and I'll say 5.3 here let me run this program and yes these values work okay so these values are working in a very perfect way uh now what I'll do is I'll simply come back to my notes and try to explain you how arrays look in memory so consider this array it is an array of three in integers and it contains 1 2 and three as the values uh so you need to make sure that one integer is 4 bytes in this architecture now it might be two bytes or it might be some other value in some other architecture it depends on the machine but let us assume that we are on a machine where one integer is 4 bytes okay this will Reserve 4 multip 3 is equal to 12 bytes in memory uh now I want to tell you something about the memory memory is contigous which means that you can simply store 0 1 0 1 0 1 01 in this manner now if you want to store an integer you need four bytes which is nothing but 4 * by 8 Bits one bite is 8 Bits so this is how memory works so what this will do is this will uh save or rather Reserve 12 bytes in memory four bytes for each integer so if you try to create a create an array like this this will Reserve 12 bytes in memory like this okay so this is how it will work so 62302 will hold this integer four bytes will uh be used by this particular integer then again uh 62306 onwards uh this integer will store this two uh this place will get four bytes this place will once again get four bytes and this is how um this is how memory management of are works okay now let's talk about Pointer arithmetic which is something you might not know or you might know but let me tell you something about array and pointers okay so let's create a program called array and pointers and I want you to be very attentive when I teach you this arrays and pointers do c so let's put in a boilerplate code and let me tell you something if I say in marks is equal to 1 2 3 and I have to make it Max 3 and I'll put a semicolon here when I do something like this this m person Mark zero which is the address of first element can be written as marks so this particular thing and this particular thing is exactly the same thing which means that if I want to change this value I can do something like this I can say Max star marks is equal to 89 if I do something like this and I try to print say Mark zero let me try to print Mark zero I'll say marks stor by student Z is uh percentage um percentage D and I'll simply say Mark Z if I run this program I'll not get one as Mark Z rather I'll get 89 as Mark Z why because I have used this pointer syntax to change the value of Mark zero 289 so what I'm saying is I'm saying the address of mark0 is nothing but marks I can actually use value at operator which is star operator I can say value at marks is equal to 89 when I do something like this what happens is value at this particular address which is m per Mark zero which is address of this particular uh place where this number is stored uh this changes the value of Mark Zer which was 1 before to 89 now so this is how all the syntax works and you can actually change the value of uh this two as well and how do I change the value of two I can increment this pointer and if I say marks Plus+ it will not be 1 plus the original address it will actually go to the next address this might sound strange so let us look into this uh more uh in a more systematic way I should say so what I'll do is I'll say in Star PTR is equal to m% mark0 but I not do something like this I I can actually do M PTR uh sorry star PTR is equal to M Mark zero but in order to explain you I'll do something like this I'll get rid of this because I have told you and let me write important here this is this is the core concept here that m% Mark zero can be written as marks so I simply said in Star PTR is equal to Marks I could have said this and the program would have worked in exactly the same way but I want to teach you this synex I want to teach you that marks is nothing but m per Mark zero this is important this is very important which is why I've marked this as important this concept is important now instead of using star marks I can use star PTR because PD is a pointer which is pointing to this so I'm saying star PD is equal to 89 and this changes the value of marks 0 is 89 what will the values of marks 1 and marks 2 and I know that you must be thinking why would these values change and you are right these values will not change these values will be two and four but listen to me carefully now if I do something like this PTR ++ PTR ++ means point to the next element now this is something that you need to understand pointer arithmetic will not add one integer to the but rather what it will do is if we have an integer pointer it will point to the next integer because the first four bytes are reserved for this particular integer so it will not touch those four bytes if I say PTR ++ it will point at the starting of next integer in the case of arrays and even if we are not dealing with arrays PTR ++ will point to the next value so if the first value is one next value is two this PTR ++ will actually point to % marks one so PTR is now ENT marks 1 which is why I can do something like this I can say PTR is equal to 65 and this will change the value of Marx 1 to 65 let me show you so the value of Marx one is now 65 can I do the same thing again can I do PTR ++ once again and will the this PTR point to four this time yes you are right this PTR will now point to 4 and you can do something like this let me make this as 82 and yes Marx 2 is now 82 you are right let me save this and run this for you Marx 2 is now 82 so this is how pointer arithmetic Works instead of changing an address by adding a number to it it will change the address by adding four to it it will make that address point to the next integer or point to the next character or point to the next floating Point next Double next long double and so on so in this case the pointer is of type integer so it will actually increment it by four instead of incrementing it by one because integer in this architecture is taking four bytes okay let's now come to the notes and try to understand this thing so a pointer can be incremented to point to the next memory location of that type note that if the address is 87994 PTR ++ will not make it 87 995 but it will check what is the type of a if it is an integer it takes four bytes it will add four to it and not one okay let's understand this example thoroughly now so in I is equal 32 simply we are assigning the value 32 inside I in Star a is equal to m i so the value uh of this pointer which is a a is an integer pointer is nothing but the address of I so let us assume this address of I is 87994 so address of this integer is 8799 4 and this integer contains 32 the name of the variable is I I hope you don't have any doubt so far let's try to Deep dive now if I do something like A++ you might think that this address will change to 87 995 but no it will not change to 87 995 it will change to 87998 why why were these four uh points added to this particular address because this is of type integer integer takes four bytes so it will point to the next integer so it will add four to it and not one okay I hope this is clear now let's try to understand the same thing using character so if I say car a is equal to a and I say Car Star B is equal to m% a so I'm creating a pointer B which is actually the address of this character a and let us assume that b is 87994 B is the address of a let us assume that it is 87 994 now since character takes one by in memory this address will now be incremented to 87 995 not because we are adding one to B but because character takes one bite so since character takes one bite one is added to this address since integer takes four bytes four is added to this address if we have another data type that takes say 9 bytes for some reason We'll add nine to this address I hope you now understood how pointer arithmetic works so so if we have something like this float I is equal to 1.7 and Float star a is equal to m% I a is actually holding the address of I and since float takes four bytes in this architecture A++ will change a from 87994 287 998 so it will add four to it why because float takes four bytes in memory I hope you are clear with all these things now so following operators can be performed uh sorry following operations can be performed on The Point uh you can add uh addition of a number to a pointer you can add a number to a pointer if you add two to a pointer it will point to the next to next integer if it is of integer type subtraction of a number from a pointer is also possible subtraction of one pointer from another is also possible comparison of two pointer variables is also possible so you can do all these operations uh you can compare two pointers you can add and subtract two pointers and so on so I hope you understood pointer arithmatic now now there's a quick quiz for you try these operations on another variables by creating pointers in a separate program demonstrate all the four operations so you need to demonstrate all these four operations so let's try to you know demonstrate this using Code so what I'll do is I'll create a new file I'll say 5core and I'll say quick quiz do c I'll put in the boiler plate code I'll zoom in and what I'll do is simply um try to demonstrate all these things to you so the very first operation says addition of a number to a pointer but before we do all this let's say in I is equal to 5 and uh let's say in Star PTR is equal to m% I so now PTR stores the address of I and I'm going to write a bunch of print of statements what I'll say is the value of I is uh percentage D back sln back sln and I'll simply say I and I'll say the address of I is I'll say ENT I or what I'll do is I'll say PTR or rather let me say ENT I but uh what I'll do is I'll say the value of PTR is I'll also print the value of PTR okay so the value of PTR is percentage U and percentage U here as well because is this is an address and I'll say PDR okay let me run this program for you and see uh how this prints uh the address of and the values of I so value of I is five address is this address is this sounds great now what I'll do is I'll simply say PTR ++ uh let me let me do something like this let me copy these two lines and let me replicate and I'll say PTR ++ okay so I have in fact added one to PTR Okay so let's see the value of PTR after increment after PTR is incremented is so let's see what the value of I is after PTR is incremented what the value of PTR is so the value of I is not going to change it will be five just like it was before um the address of I will not change because it's directly taking address of I and the PTR will change and four will be added to it can you see that so the previous value of PTR was this now four is added it's uh 20 previously it was 216 at the end now it's 220 because four is added and what about the address of I address of I is not going to change address of I is the address of I it's not going to change just like your address is not going to change if you live in say Mumbai your address is not going to change if you live in Hyderabad your address is not going to change unless until unless you are vacating the house and moving to some new place so I'll say save this program and what I'll do is I'll say PTR is equal to PTR + 1 so I can either say PTR ++ or I can say PTR is equal to PTR + 1 so we'll get the same results the value of PTR after PTR is incremented is this let me get rid of this line because the address of I is not going to change uh let me keep one line uh to demonstrate that PTR is changing now the PTR is 220 what if I say PTR is equal to PTR + 2 if I add two to a pointer 8 is going to be added to the address of the pointer because it's going to shift the pointer by two places and when I say shift the pointer by two places it simply means that it's going to shift it by 2 multiply by the number of bytes taken by integer which is 2 * 4 which is eight and hence eight is added to this previous address I hope that makes sense so we have added a number to a pointer now let's subtract a number from a pointer I can subtract a number from a pointer so what if I say PTR minus 2 it will be decremented from the pointer let me show this to you so it was 216 before 216 - 8 is 208 so it's 208 now I hope that makes sense as well subtraction of a pointer from another now this is very interesting so let us say I give you an array okay marks and I tell you that there are 100 items in this array so marks is an array there are 100 items in this array I want to ask you how many bytes does this array element takes so you can say Marx one minus Marx Z that will be the address of Marx one minus address of marks zero and if you you know decrement U the value of marks Zero from Marks One you'll get four if it is an integer so the difference between two addresses will actually tell you how many bytes each enti is consuming let me show this to you so if I say uh in I is equal to 5 and if I say PTR is equal PTR minus 2 what if I say PTR minus instead of printing the PTR what if I print PTR minus m% I it will actually tell me that you have incremented the value of pointer by these many units so let me put a percentage D here and let me show you how this works so when I say percentage D it will show me two and it will not show me the absolute difference between these two numbers no it will not show me that it will actually show me the ab absolute difference divided by the number of bytes taken by one unit which is four so it will tell me -4 / - 8 divid 4 which is nothing but min-2 so I hope this helps you so this is basically telling me uh how behind is PTR from the address of I because we have already decremented minus 2 so it's simply telling me that you are you have decremented the pointer by two so this is uh how subtraction of 1 pointer from another Works comparison of two pointers you can actually compare two pointers so let me show you how comparison of two pointer works so um let me get rid of this and let me say uh the value of comparing two pointers let me say comparing PTR with ERS I or let me get rid of this and let me simply say if PTR is greater than M percenti I can do something like this and what I'll do is I'll say PTR is greater and uh I'll copy this particular line and I'll simply say else and I'll say PTR is not greater so this will actually tell me whether PTR is greater or not in this case is PTR greater no it's not greater because we have already decremented it by two so it should give me PTR is not greater but what if I make it PTR + 2 so I can actually find out whether my address is behind M perc I or is it not behind MC I so since I have incremented two which is I have shifted it by two values by two integers which means that eight units eight bytes rather have been added to the initial address so PTR has to be greater now so PTR is greater so we can do pointer comparison just like we did um pointer subtraction addition and subtraction of a number from a pointer I hope that this quick quiz helps you a lot and it will help you understand all these Concepts more clearly now accessing arrays using pointers so this is something that I have already told you that you can actually access an array using pointers so if PTR points to index zero PTR ++ will point to index one and so on so if I say PTR is equal to am percent of let us say Mark zero which is PTR is pointing to the first element of this array I can do PTR ++ to make it point to this number I can do PTR is equal to PTR + 2 to make it point to this number and so on I can keep on incrementing this pointer and it will shift itself to the next value uh as in when I keep on incrementing a number to it so this way we can have an integer pointer pointing to first element of the array like this so I can have integer pointer uh which is in Star PTR pointing to the first element of the array so I can either say in Star PTR is equal to M ARR Z or I can simply say ARR I can also say in Star PTR is equal to ARR some I told you here I've already told you in arrays and pointers so either you can do something like this or you can simply say marks this also is equivalent to saying m per Mark zero this will point to the first element of the array the name of the array will point to the first element of the array this is how you can remember it okay so PTR ++ will make it point to the next integer so if you do star PTR you will get nine because this is the next integer and so on you can keep on incrementing the pointer and you will keep on you know moving the pointer to the next next next next and the next element and so on okay now here comes the interesting part wherein we can pass arrays to functions we can actually pass arrays to functions and when we are passing arrays to the functions an entire copy of the array will not be created this is something that you need to keep in your mind so many people think that if they pass an array to a function a copy of the entire array will be created no that is not the case just the address of first element is passed and I'm going to demonstrate this to you so arrays can be passed to the function like this so you can make a function called like this you can say print array a r RN and is the size of the array and you can say void print array in Star I int n and this is the function prototype okay this is the function prototype void print array in I int n this is the function prototype or this can be the function prototype you can either accept this as an address or you can simply accept the array okay so this will also work the same way I'll show you how this works so let's come to the VSS code and let's see how we can pass array to functions so let me create a file let's say 06 uncore array to functions. C let me put in the boiler plate code and also what I'll do is okay so I'll fix one thing with my snippet I'll show you what is the problem with my snippet so when I say C boiler plate and I press enter and when I'm typing something can you see this highlighted stuff here this is basically telling me that when you press tab you are going to move to some other place so when I press tab I'm actually moved to this last line but I did not come to this last line so in order to fix this I'll go to my user Snippets c. Json and here is the snippet so in order to fix this I'll change this to Dollar Z and this should fix my snippet I'll close this and if I say C boiler plate code and I type something here pressing tab will not lead me here anymore okay so this was a basic problem with my snipet and I was just silent about it I'm glad that I fixed it so I can do something like this and I can start typing anyways let's try to create a function let me call it void Funk and it simply takes a an integer pointer and let me also do something like this and I don't need this PTR here this is a function prototype with the semicolon and this is the function body so let us say I have an array called marks let me copy it from here and I need I need integer array so let me try to uh get some integer array from somewhere I'm too lazy to type I don't know why let me know in the comments if you are lazy as well I'm really very lazy I'm just searching for some array to copy from so so I unfortunately can't find an array okay I I just found an array I can copy this and I can paste it here and uh what I'll do is I can now simply use Marx Z Marks One Marx 2 to access the elements of this marks but what if I say funk and marks what will happen is the address of the first element of the array will be copied to PTR and now what I can do is I can write a fall Loop and I can do something like this I can say in I is equal to z i is less than 3 uh and I ++ I can do print F and I can say uh the value of Max percentage D is percentage D and I can do something like this uh I and U PTR ++ okay so this will actually uh in increment the value of pointer and at the same time it will dreference it so I'll say star PTR ++ and this will make sense to you let me finish and this will definitely make sense to you and also let me add these square brackets here so I'll add these square brackets like this and let me run this for you once I run this uh okay so I need to say percentage D and not M perc D so the value of Mark Z is 1 2 and four so you can see um also I should write back sln here I don't know why I keep on forgetting uh to put a new line so you can see Mark 0 is one then Marx one is two Marx 2 is four which is correct how is this working so basically what I'm doing is I'm copying the address of this particular thing inside uh inside of here okay now what I'm doing is I'm dereferencing this pointer and at the same time I'm incrementing it so that the next time the next iteration of the Fall Loop runs I will get the incremented pointer so initially the pointer was pointing to one I printed one in the next iteration of the Fall Loop pointer will point to two because I am saying p++ every time I running this iteration of the follow Loop so if I say PT ++ once again the pointer will point to this and so on it will keep on incrementing itself until it reaches the last item of the array and this is how we can pass arrays to the functions what if I do something like this what if I say star PTR is equal to um say 56 for some reason what if I what if I change the items to 56 um what if I change marks 0 1 and 2 to 56 for some reason will they be reflected here what if I try to access the value of marks Zer marks 1 and marks 2 will they be changed here is the question and you need to answer this in the comments so I'll say markai tell me whether this value will be changed to 56 or not let me get rid of this printf statement so whatever is printed now will be printed from here so we are running this function will this function be able to make changes to this array this is the question answer mean yes or no uh and you can use time stamps of the video to tell me which question you are answering I'm waiting for your comment make sure you post the comment and one more thing I'll need to do here is p++ because I'm getting rid of this line so I'll do p++ now tell me whether this will change the are to 56 56 56 or not so I'll now run this program to show you that all these values will be changed to 56 56 and 56 as you can see the value of Mark 0 1 and 2 is changed to 56 because we are dealing in addresses this time we are passing the address of the first element of the array to this function and since we are passing the address to this function what happens is that this um that this address is actually dereferenced and the actual value of Mark 0 1 and two is changed so I hope this makes sense and these are the programs that I'll zip and you know put it in the description somewhere so that you can access and all these codes are going to help you a lot believe me so you can access these codes try to run them on your own and you'll definitely get a hang off all the concepts using these notes the codes and the video obviously so let's not talk about multi-dimensional arrays and then we'll conclude this chapter so multi-dimensional array is something that you might not use a lot of times if you're writing simple program s but if you want to say write programs on matrices or you want to visualize a 2d Grid or a 2d table containing numbers you might want to use multi-dimensional arrays look at multi-dimensional arrays as a two dimensional grid let me search multidimensional array and let me go to images and let me see if I can actually show you something so this is a very good image to start with so row 0 Row one row two column 0 column 1 column two so the rows starts from zero column starts from zero so if I say a RR 0 0 this will or rather let us say the name of the variable the name of the array is X so I can actually reference this value as x0 this is x01 this is x02 and so on so I can visualize this particular two-dimensional grid and I can set all these values so let me show this to you by writing a program 07 multi-dimensional array.c boiler plate code and let me say in marks let us say I want to express marks of four students from two classes so uh marks or let me make it to four so two classes four students so students are in the columns and the classes are in rows so let us say we have two two sections section A and section B section A has four students section B has four students I'm keeping these numbers as low so that you can um you know easily visualize what is happening now what I'll do is I'll simply say Mark 0 0 so uh mark0 is section A so first student of section A has got 98 marks now second student of section A got say 93 marks uh let us assume that the section A contains you know list of brilliant students so second student sorry third student of U section A let us say he got he was unlucky and he got 83 marks and this is the lowest score and let us say the last student of section I got 90 sorry 88 marks now I'll do the same for Section uh section B and let us say all these people have no interest in studies they are back benchers they are uh they're lazy people just like me but I used to score a lot of marks by the way so these are lazy people who are not able to score marks okay now in marks 24 98 93 83 88 and so on okay now what I've done here is I've actually set all these values now I can use a double for Loop to you know I trate all these values so let me show you how this works so I'll put two here another tab another for Loop so this might really uh you know sound very confusing to you and you might think that is this something that I I even need is this something that I even need to study but let me tell you something two dimensional array is something that you will ever need if you're writing some complex programs I'm not saying that you'll not need threedimensional five dimensional 10 dimensional areas I've seen people working with 50 dimensional arrays but again that is very very rare so two dimensional array is something that you need to Target initially and later everything will seem very easy to you so here what I'll do is I'll say Max IG Max IG is nothing but the um some value which is which this particular thing is currently at let me show you something I'll say print F and I'll say percentage D and I'll simply put this Max IG here okay so let me put Max IJ here if I run this program what will happen is all these values will get printed without any space without any new line which will really get very confusing so what I'll do is I'll add a space here after percentage D so if I run this program all these numbers will be printed with a space between them but I don't want them to print this way I want to print them in this way in this fashion so how do I do that so let's try to understand how this double fall Loop is working so this follow Loop is for rows let me write a comment here for rows so we are saying for the first row you do this and and you once again do this for the second row and this is for columns this is painting the columns so this will paint column one for the first row column two for the first row then once again when the row is the second row the row being painted is second row this will print the first element then second element of the row then third element of the row and so on so this is for columns it's basically painting The Columns okay so what I can do is every time uh it is done painting all the columns I can say print backs slash so I can say print F and I can do something like this I can say back sln so I'm printing a new line every time entire row gets painted so this will run for the first row and once all the elements are painted for the first row I'll print a back SL try to visualize this try to do the dry run of this program and if I run this program now you'll see for the first row these values are printed for the second row all these values are printed so so these people have no interest in studies they score you know relatively low marks and the first row is the list of students uh who actually achieve good marks so if I do something like this you'll see first row has four columns second row has four columns so two rows four columns this is what we you know initially declared and this is how this works so if you want to uh you know visualize this directly you can clearly see that Marx one 2 is is 43 and where is one two coming one two will come somewhere here let me show you here itself so first row sorry second row Marks One is second row and 012 third column so 012 this should be 43 and yes it's indeed 43 Mark 0 0 is 98 Mark 0 0 through Z column this is 0 through First Column which is 93 this is 0 through third column um sorry zero throw 01 2 second column which is 83 and so on so so this is how you can visualize a two-dimensional array now you can make it 20 and 40 you can make it as big of a number as you want but this is the idea so I hope I uh I hope that I was able to explain you all these things and you understood um how these multi-dimensional arrays work so I've written the same thing in the notes as well an array can be of two dimensional it can be a three-dimensional array it can be an N dimensional and can be a number as huge as thousand or 10,000 for that matter a two dimensional array can be defined something like this you can have multiple curly braces instead of doing this I could have done let me show you what I could have done uh this and let me try to use my visual studio code skills here so what I'll do is I'll simply take all the cursors here I'll say shift home so shift home will actually get me here I'll press a backspace which will make me get rid of all these numbers so 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 and 4 * by 2 is 8 so we have all the numbers now what I want is I want to start this uh so I want to actually change all these to comma uh so what I'll do is I'll do something like this I'll I'll take U I'll do something like this so there are four elements in one row so I'll have to do something like this I could have replaced this uh semicolon with u with a comma but I don't want that it's fine so this is onedimensional array this is a onedimensional array then once again we'll have another one dimensional array here let me show you how so what I'll do is I'll simply replace all these semicolons with a comma and I'll do something like this and uh and I think I'll simply use um keyboard okay so this was bit time consuming for me but again it's going to be worth it for you because I'm going to explain you how two dimensional arrays work so let me put this curly brace here and also let me put another curly brace here so basically what what is happening here is and let me put a comma here let me put another comma here okay I don't need a comma here so I'll Simply Save it and what is this error for expected a semicolon okay so I'll do something like this I'll say marks Max 24 is equal to or rather I can do this directly instead of writing the Declaration separately I'll do this directly I'll do something like this and this will work and also I'll put a semicolon here so what is happening here is try to understand this what is happening here is I I'm saying give me an array of arrays two dimensional array is nothing but array of arrays so this is an array and inside this are a lot of arrays so there are two arrays inside of this so so basically I'm writing this grid as is so if I run this program I'll save it and run this program you'll get the same output you'll get the same grid as the output no surprises whatsoever so 83 88 38 63 43 68 and so on okay so this is another way of writing um all the values of a two dimensional array we can access the elements of this array as ARR 0 AR 01 and so on so AR 01 is four because uh zero throw and uh the this particular element 01 uh First Column starting from zero so this is how two dimensionales work and you can have three dimensional arrays you can have 10 dimensional arrays you can have 99 n dimensional arrays and so on although it's very rare to see uh an array which is greater than three dimensional three is the max and in fact two is something that is very rarely used onedimensional arrays are very very common so let's try to see two dimensional arrays in memory so a 2d array like a one is stored in continuous memory blocks always remember that the memory in our computer consists of continuous memory blocks so the contiguous memory locations simply work this way that if we have 222 then the next memory location will be 223 and so on so if we have U an array which contains integers the memory locations will look like this so if we have an array of integers uh the memory locations will have a gap of four between them so if you have 147 9 1122 this is the address of this particular element this is the address of this particular element so we have a gap of four so a two Dimension are stored in continuous blocks like this a 0 0 will be stored here a 01 will be this so they are actually onedimensional but they appears to be two dimensional to us uh try to think about it so they are continuous memory blocks the first block is error 0 0 next is error 01 and they are simply accessible using these two indexes 0 1 02 22 32 so you can actually visualize a two dimensional are like this but actually deep within the memory they are in a continuous block do not get confused with this topic today 2D arrays in memory I just wanted to tell you that all the data on your memory is stored in the form of continguous blocks so a 2d array like a 1D AR is stored in continuous blocks um and uh there's a quick quiz for you I hope you understood this concept you need to create a 2d array by taking input from the user write a display function to print the content of this 2D array on this screen we have already done this all you need to do is wrap this inside a display function and I know you will do it so we have already written this program to print a 2d array but you need to wrap it inside a display function and I hope that you understood this I hope that this made complete sense to you you can actually get rid of the number of spaces here um if you think that the number of spaces being used are too much so you can do something like this you can get rid of these spaces um if you add spaces inside C programming language it doesn't mind so you can do something like this as well and the program will uh very well work so I hope that this chapter made sense to you we learned a lot of Concepts we learned about pointers how arrays and pointers work together how pointer arithmetic works so a lot of Concepts in this chapter in case you have not understood any concept I um urge you to remind this video and look at those Concepts before proceeding uh so we'll now move on to the next chapter and we are going to look into more Concepts but before before that we are going to solve chapter 7 practice set so let's move on to chapter 7 practice set now all right so time to solve the practice set this practice set is related to pointers and arrays so let's talk about this practice set we'll talk about arrays in this practice set we'll practice problems on multi-dimensional arrays let's see what all this practice set has to offer let's move to question number one create an array of 10 numbers you have to create an array of 10 numbers which is pretty straightforward at this point if you are watching this sces so let me open this particular folder on vs code and let me also create a program for this first question we want to start this question with problem number one so let me say 08 uncore PR not pro I wanted to say PR pr01 Doc and let me put the boiler plate code here and uh after putting the boiler plate code what I'll do is I will simply create an array of 10 numbers verify using pointer arith that PTR plus2 points to the third element where PTR is a pointer pointing to the first element of the array okay so let's let's uh start discussing that uh so what I'll do is I'll create an array of 10 numbers I've done that I'll simply say ARR 0 is equal to 7 and let me also fill in the values of ARR 1 and 2 I need not fill the values of arr3 onwards let's skip that now what I'll do is I'll say instar PTR is equal to so PTR is a pointer and this pointer is pointing to the first element of the array okay so I can either say this I can also say this this is also valid uh in Star PTR is equal to ARR ERS of error zero this is also valid this is the same thing ARR points to the address of first element we have already seen this if if you are if you still stuck why this is the case I think you have not watched the chapter carefully I want you to watch the chapter 7 carefully and if you haven't done that please go back to chapter 7 and watch it carefully now inar PTR is equal to ARR now what I'll do is I'll simply say PTR is equal to PTR + 2 which means I'm updating PTR to two so let's now print the value at PTR is and I'll simply say percentage D percentage D and I'll simply uh use the value at operator which is star PTR and let me also say the same thing here so initially what will happen is the value at PTR will be seven and later it's going to be 8 okay let's verify this and this is very straightforward let me tell you so initially it is seven after that it is eight because this is pointing to the third element now we have incremented the pointer by two which means initially it was pointing to the first element then I shifted it by two which means it will now point to the third element okay this was pretty straightforward question if S3 is a 1D array of integers Then star s + 3 refers to the third element is this true is this true tell me is this true or not I want you to answer this question in the comments write the time stamp and answer true or false come on I'm waiting for your comment okay so if you have commented I want you to understand that if S3 is a one D array of integer s + one will point to the second element if s is pointing to the first element s+1 will point to the second element s+2 will point to the third element s+ 3 will point to the fourth element but there is no fourth element there are only three elements verify this using pointer arithmatic you will find out so let me let me Google arrays let me uh you know take some image and tell you so let us say this is the first element this is PTR 200 is the PTR so this particular value which is B it is PTR + 1 PTR + 2 so third element will be achieved after I uh increment my PTR by two so if I increment my PTR by three that will point to the fourth element and not to the third element so this is false okay write a program to create an array of 10 integers and store multiplication table of five in it so you have to create an array of 10 integers and then you have to store multiplication table of five in it so this is a very simple problem once again all you have to do is create an array of 10 integers and then all you need to do is populate that array using a fall Loop let's see how this can be done so I'll say 09 uncore pr02 Doc and what I will do is I'll copy paste the program that I've already written why did I do that I did that because already I've created an array of 10 integers now I'll use the fall Loop and I'll simply say in I is equal to 10 sorry I is equal to 0 I is less than 10 and uh in place of this code what I'll do is I'll copy this print F I'll say the value of I'll say the value of percentage d uh or rather uh 5 * by percentage D percentage D is uh and also let me do one more thing I'll say I here so in place of this percentage D this I will be printed and in this place uh in place of this percentage D I want a rri to be printed so this is very simple and straightforward so what I'm doing is before I do this what I'll do is um I'll simply say AR I is equal to 5 * I so what this will do is it will start printing uh values of 5 * by 0 all the way till 5 * by 9 so let me show this to you so 5 * 0 is equal to 0 5 * 1 is equal to 5 so it's starting the multiplication table from zero onwards but I want to start my multiplication table from one onwards so what I'll do is I'll replace this I with I + 1 here as well as here so so I'll simply print I + 1 instead of I let's run this and you'll find out that multiplication table of five has been printed you might also want to use double for Loop but again why would you do that you can simply assign uh the value to the array as well as you can print the value uh inside the same for Loop if you want another for Loop you can do that as well that also works so all you'll have to do is you'll first initialize the entire array and then you will print so that will also you know do the same thing so either way it works so I hope you were able to solve this problem and you understood this problem pretty clearly this was problem number three so I I would like to rename this program to pr03 because I want you to have all these codes for reference I'll give you the notes I'll zip all these Source codes notes and everything and I'll give it to you in the description so um coming back to the practice set repeat problem three for a journal input provided by the user using SCF all you have to do is instead of writing this five you'll replace it with n uh so let me solve this problem for you this is very simple problem so I'll say 10or p4. C and what I'll do is I'll copy this code and instead of writing five I'll replace this five with n and um you know I I'll have to use another percentage D where I'm printing n and um I'll do that I'll do that and not null I want to use n so N is a variable which will be say six and let's see if we get the multiplication table of six so if I run this program oh yes I'm getting the multiplication table of six so this program works it was pretty simple and straightforward but the question asks for using a user defined value so I'll say enter the value of N and I'll simply use back sln and uh I'll use scanf percentage D so percentage D and M perc n so you can simply add the value of uh assign the value uh 7 to n or any value that you enter will be assigned to n and you can see that the multiplication table of seven is printed on the screen so this program works I hope it was pretty simple straightforward let's move on to the next problem which says that write a program containing a function which reverses the array pass to it so all you have to do is you have to reverse an array so this is a very interesting problem this is very interesting problem so look at this problem very carefully I'll solve this problem for you so let me create another program pr05 doc boilerplate code and um problem number five yes so we have to reverse an array so what I'll do is I'll say in and and this is a very famous interview question as well look at add this really very carefully guys so let me copy this and also let me write the function body or let me tell you one more thing that you can directly write the function body skipping the Prototype that also works okay so I'll do that um if I say in Reverse in Star PTR U I'm taking the first elements address into PTR and then I can operate on the array so what I'll do is I'll say int AR uh is equal to let me have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 and 10 let me have an array of U one uh all the way till 10 and let me reverse this array but before I reverse this array uh I also want to print this array so I'll simply display this array and display is something that I will uh write it's a function I'll write this function so I'll say void display inst star or let me call it PTR because we have been calling it PTR uh I'll use a fall Loop I'll say n i is equal to zero I is less than um I I also need the size of uh this array which is n so I'll simply say int n I'll say print F and then I'll say percentage D and I'll dreference PTR and then what I'll do is I'll say PTR ++ that's it so I'll D reference PTR initially then I'll say PTR ++ which will increment PTR and I'll get all the elements from this array so let's see if this function works so all I need to do is pass 10 to it because there are 10 elements let's see if this function works but reverse does nothing so far so you should get um 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 I'll also add a space here so that we have space between the elements of our array and also before the function returns I'll print a new line because if we are printing something else after displaying the array that should also get reflected so uh you'll not see 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 and the same thing once again you will see it in a new line this time so that's why I have added this new line here so 1 to 10 1 to 10 because reverse does nothing now listen to me very carefully let me take an image I'll use this image to explain you uh or rather let me take some other image Okay so so this image even looks better uh so let us say we have 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 as the indices and these are the values okay so we have an array of size nine not eight note that the size of this array is nine if you count the number of elements they are nine because we are starting from zero not from one okay now what will happen is if I want to reverse this array what I'll do is I'll replace 7 with 46 I'll replace 11 with 96 I'll replace 6 with I'll replace six with 16 I'll replace 55 with 45 and at 98 I'll stop now I'll not stop I'll not go all the way till 46 I mean I'll not go all the way from this index to this index and keep swapping because the moment I reach the midpoint if I swap 7 by 46 11 by 96 6X 16 55x 45 I will have to stop here if I want to reverse the array because if I go even further what will happen is I'll end up reversing the array two times I don't want that okay if I reverse this array if if I start from index zero and go all the way till four what will happen is I'll reverse the array the moment I reach four but if I go beyond four what will happen is I will reverse the array once again and what will happen is the array will not change so let me code this for you so how how do we code this how do we code this so this was the case when number of um elements in the array were odd what if the number of items in the array is even so if we have eight elements the index will go from 0 to 7 let's assume that this 46 and 8 is not there let's assume that we have uh this is this is all we have let's assume this is all we have let us say this array starts at index0 and ends at index 7 let us assume this is the array now if I want to swap uh the first element with 96 uh I will do that I can swap I'll swap 11 with 16 I can swap 6 with 45 and I can swap 55 with 98 so I can keep swapping till the size of the array which is 8 / 2 - one uh starting from zero I'll go till this index and I can keep swapping let me show you this in code so what I'll do is I'll use the same array and um let me use the same array or or or let me not use the same array I'll use this array what I will do is I have this PTR what I'll do is I'll swap this element which is index zero with index n minus one so I'm swapping 0 with n minus one okay so let me write this here let me cut this from here let me write this here I'll say swap 0 with n minus one and swap one with what one with n minus 2 and swap index 2 with n minus 3 and so on keep on doing till n by2 so you keep on doing till we'll find out till n by2 okay let's let's say in N by2 we are just assuming we might change this so swap zero with n minus one 1 with n minus 2 2 with n minus uh 3 I can write a General uh swapping equation you can call it I with n minus I min-1 or + one tell me minus one okay so I can say n minus i - one so if the value of I is 2 it will be nus 3 if the value of I is zero it will be n minus one so I'll swap I the element at index I with element at index n- i - one let's do that let's do that so what I'll do is I'll write this swapping logic I've already told you about the swapping logic but before that let me write the follow Loop I'll say I is equal to z i is less than n let me also pass the size of the array which is n which is 10 in this case and what I'll do is I'll simply swap um I'll do this inside the fall Loop so I'll say swap I with nus i- 1 so what I'll do is I'll say let me also create a variable called temp I'll use this variable for swapping I'll say temp is equal to PT okay I'll say temp is equal to PT and also let me do this instead of you know using the PTR uh as a pointer what I'll do is I'll use ARR let me use or let me use a itself if not ARR I'll say temp is equal to ai ai is equal to a n - i - 1 and a n - i - 1 is equal to what it will be equal to Temp so this way what will happen is I'll swap AI with a n minus IUS one I've already told you about the swapping logic so um I've already discussed this in previous chapters so I'll not discuss this again so this will simply swap AI with a n minus i- one and that's it that should swap the array so let's see if we are able to um Swap this entire array so let's start from um you know one and we are going all the way till 10 so if I run this program what will happen is you will see that the array is not swapped and the reason is that we started from zero and we went all the way till n but what we want to do is we want to go from 0 to n by 2 minus 1 so I'll simply say I less than n by2 um I'll run this program and you can see the array has been reversed how does this program work let me explain you so if the number of uh okay let's check does this program work if the number of elements in the array is even so if we have um sorry if the number of elements in the array is odd so we have nine elements here let's see if this works also I'll say nine here not 10 so let me also say nine and let me run this so yeah it works it works for uh odd elements odd number of elements as well it works for even number of elements we have already seen that it works for odd number of elements as well so let's now try to understand how this works how going from n by2 minus one let me make it minus one because we are starting from zero and we are going um starting from zero so we'll say uh I'm going till n by 2us 1 starting from zero so I started from zero I'll go till n by 2 minus one so this is how it works now n by2 for odd numbers will not be a floating Point number let me tell you so if you have nine 9 divided 2 will not be 4.5 it will be four because uh operation between an integer and integer will result into an integer in C language this is something that you need to understand so coming back to this figure uh the number of elements in this array is 9 okay so the value of n is 9 so if I say 9 by 2 it will be 4 not 4.5 so what will happen is I'll start from here I'll say uh 0 1 1 2 3 4 I I'll start from zero and I'll go all the way till 3 if I say uh I is less than 4 it will go from 0 to three okay so if I go from 7 to 55 this is the midpoint I can swap the entire array if if there is an extra element in the array or let us say if there is um if there are only eight elements in the array what will happen is index will be from 0 to 7 and in that case what will happen is that I can start from um I can start from zero and go all the way till 3 once again and I'll be able to swap the area you can see so zero will be swapped with seven one will be swapped with six two will be swapped with five uh let me draw let me you know do a full screen snep and show you so what will happen is 7 will be SED with what 7 will be SED with 46 11 will be swapped with 96 6 will be swed with 16 and 55 will be swed with 45 that's it and then I I'll have to stop here I can swap 98 with 98 that will not make any sense I mean you can do that you might skip it um that will not add to add to anything um not even to the computational complexity because this is just one element and that will not grow for larger inputs anyway we are not talking about computation complexity in this video uh so we can start from here and we can you know swap it till here okay so this was one case now is there any way to clean the board uh I wish there was a way to clean the board so I can simply say I can simply use this let us say that this is not there U let us say this is this is not there so let's assume that these two the this last element is not there so I'm just you know uh I just scribbled it off so let's say this element has uh let's say this array has only eight elements now in this case what will happen is I can swap 796 1116 645 and 55 98 so all I need to do is I need to start from zero and go all the way till three for eight elements as well as for nine elements so all I need to do is I need to go from uh I need to run my fall loop from 0 to n by2 minus 1 so I'll simply write n by2 here this is something that you can you know get a feel of after doing some dry run you can print the value of I you can see how all these things are working by visualizing them like I'm am doing here but I hope that you understood and this might sound a bit intimidating if if you are starting out but this is a very common question and you will definitely encounter it if you are working with C if you are studying C in your college you might get this question in your exams believe me moving on to the next question which is uh problem number um six if I'm not wrong six yes write a program containing functions which counts the number of positive integers in an array this is something that I want you to do you need to write a function you need to pass an array and you need to see whether two divides a number or not so if two divides a number it is even if two doesn't divide a number it is odd uh but we need to find number of positive integers not positive even or positive odd integers so how do you find whether a number is positive or not simply find out whether it is greater than zero or not if it is greater than zero um it is positive if it is less than zero it is negative so please write your if else uh statements write your function this is very simple problem I want you to do it yourself now question number seven says create an array of size 3x 10 containing multiplication tables of 2 7 and 9 respectively so this is something that I'll definitely solve for you um and uh this will definitely give you some idea of multi-dimensional arrays so let's solve this problem so 12core pr07 doc I'll put down the boiler plate code and we need to store multiplication tables of 27 and 9 so I'll say um and mul and how many what is the size 3x 10 3 by 10 okay now what I'll do is I'll simply write two for Loops I'll simply write two for Loops one will run from 0 to three I mean 0 to two because I'm saying I less than three and the other for Loop will start from I'll change it to J because I already have I in my outer loop uh I'll start it from zero all the way till 9 here I can use multiable IG is equal to I'll simply say multiable IG is equal to um some value let us say uh n uh num I I'll tell you what num I is multiply by multiply by what multiply by J okay so I'll simply say this and that's about it but what is num num is an array I want to create an array num which will simply which will simply tell me which number I am on so 27 and 9 so I'll simply say 27 and 9 and I'll tell you how this is working how this program is working so num is a onedimensional array containing 27 and 9 so num zero will be two num 1 will be S and num two will be nine so whenever I need two 7 or 9 I can use num I so firstly what I'll do is I'll start from this number two I'll write multiplication table of two so in order to write multiplication table of two I'll simply say uh multiable i j is equal to num I star J and uh remember we have written a function to print a multi-dimensional array if I'm not wrong it was here so this was the function so I'll copy this function and U I'll paste it here so after we are done what I'll do is uh three and 10 so three and 10 what I'll do is I'll use uh this function to print all these values so let's let's run this program and see if uh if it works so multiplication table of two is here multiplication table of seven is here and multiplication table of 9 is here but we are missing a number here I don't know why so I'm starting from zero going all the way till 9 so 9 * 2 is equal 18 u in case of 7 I'm St starting from um zero and I'm going all the way till 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 so what this is doing is this is the multiplication table of two this is for seven this is for 9 we have solved it but I don't want my multiplication table to start from zero I want it to start from one and in order to fix this problem what I'll do is I'll simply use j+ one here so I'll use j+ 1 here that's about it if I use j+ 1 here I'll start from two and I'll finish at 20 so let's see if this works so yes I'll start from two finish at 20 start at 7 finish at 70 start at 9 finish at 90 I hope that you are able to understand how this program is working so this was a program on multi-dimensional arrays you'll get all these codes I'll zip them up and I'll give all these codes as well as the notes to you so this is the folder that I'm going to zip I'm going to zip it and it will be all yours okay so coming back to question number eight you have to repeat problem seven for a custom input given by the user and this is very straightforward use scanf use n instead of you know um or or or rather use uh scanf inside a for Loop to populate this num array okay so you can populate this numb array I will leave that on your creativity you can always do that you can create an array of size 2 3 10 um size of your choice okay let's move on to the next question create a threedimensional are and print the address of of its elements in increasing order and you can do that to print the addresses of the elements in increasing order you need to start from 0 0 0 then 0 0 1 then 0 1 0 and so on okay so if you write a loop like this so all you need to do is you need to write triple for Loop like this and you need to print the address and it will be in uh increasing order okay let me show you that the address will be in increasing order so if I if I do print F and I I do percentage u a space and if I do something like this am person multiple IG this is going to be in increasing order let me show you so if I uh if I run this program for you so all these addresses are in increasing order 88 92 96 100 and then 104 8 12 16 20 24 28 32 36 you can see all these numbers are in increasing order I want you to see I want you to look and check all these addresses are in increasing order so if you want to print uh addresses of an array in increasing order all you need to do is um simply start uh from i j k or whatever is the dimension of your array and put it inside the fall Loop and simply print the address it will be in increasing order okay I hope that you understood it let me simply comment it down uh so this was about uh multi-dimensional arrays and uh arrays and pointers and the relationship of array and pointers so yeah we are done with chapter number seven let's move on to chapter number eight now and we'll look into some more concepts of C programming language let's move to chapter 8 now before we move to the next chapter we are going to look at this project which is snake water and gun a very simple project but yet very powerful game to code in C programming language so if you don't know what snake B gun game is let me give you uh good amount of idea of what this game is and how you can play this game so snake water gun or rock paper scissor is a game most of us have already played this game during our school times so I I I sometimes even play it now to be very honest but we have to write a program capable of playing this game with you so basically if you select snake and the computer or the all the other person playing the game with you has selected say water snake will drink the water and snake will win so if you select snake and the other person selects the gun gun will shoot the snake off and snake will die and hence the gun will win if you play it with water and the other person is having the gun gun will actually get drowned inside the water and will stop functioning and hence it will be a win for water so what we have to do is we have to make the computer play this game for you so how do we do it let's see how we can do it so the very first step in playing this game will be to receiving the user input so what I'll do is I'll open this folder in visual Studio code and I'll create a file called game. C I guess I have not enabled C++ extension I'll just check whether they are enabled or not so C++ extension is enabled and also code Runner is enabled cool everything is enabled we have we are all set so I'll put the boiler plate code in now what I'll do is I'll uh start by taking or receiving input from the user I'll ask the user to give me the character it can be snake s for snake W for water G for gun so let's start so I'll create two characters I'll say car U and Comm U for U Comm for computer okay now definitely I'm going to generate a random number why why am I generating a random number I'll tell you why so we have already seen how to generate a random number but we are generating a random number to randomly select snake water or a gun for a for a computer so what I'll do is I'll say Sr time Zer this will actually set my random seat to Time Zero which will be a random number always and now what I'll do is I'll simply say in number is equal to Rand person 100 + 1 okay so what this will do is this will simply give me a random number starting from one all the way till 100 any random number can be provided to me inside number I also make sure that I have time. H included because this is the file that we need uh if we want to use all these functions also I'll include stdlib.h because this is also something that we need if we are generating a random number what I'll do is now I'll ask the user what do you want to uh choose so I'll simply say uh select s or or rather enter I'll say enter s s character for snake and W character for water and G character for gun so you have to do this this is pretty straightforward now what you'll do is yes a good old scanner function and percentage C for character and person U it will be a character for you so you might be snake or water or gun you can be anything okay but computer can also be snake water or gun you will not know whether the computer is snake water or gun how will we decide whether computer is snake water or gun I'll use a bunch of IFL statements so if the number generated out of one and 100 is less than 33 I'll randomly give computer a snake otherwise what I'll do is else if else if the number is C less than 66 if it is less than 66 which means that it is definitely greater than 33 if it didn't went inside this if Loop sorry if block uh it will definitely be greater than 33 and lesser than 66 in that case I'll randomly assign it water otherwise in other cases I'll assign it gun so I'll say else no condition inside else I'll say else computer is gun now you can shuffle them around you can do water gun snake or snake gun water whatever you want okay that's that's your choice now what I'll do is I'll simply say int result is equal to snake water gun which is going to be a function and that function will take you and computer as the input and this will either declare you as the winner or you as a loser and computer as the winner so if this result is equal to zero I'll simply say that game Draw I'll say printf game drawn okay otherwise if this result is Cal to 1 what I'll do is I'll say print F oops I made a mistake here I need to close this if block here format document I have formatted this document I'll use contr S to save I don't like this I need my if statements and the curly bracket in one line now if this happens what I'll do is let people put a back slash in here as well I'll simply say if result is equal to one you win okay I'll say you win okay otherwise definitely you lost okay so I'll say you lost you lost okay or you lose okay now what I'll do is I'll simply show you at the end of the program what character did you choose and what computer choose so I'll say print F I'll say you chose percentage C and the computer chose percentage C okay uom because at the end I'll definitely give you a good idea of why you won or why you lost now our entire task or the entire game revolves around this function which is uh snake waterer gun game it's going to return an integer and it will take two integers sorry characters U and comp now definitely If U and comp are equal I'll immediately return zero which means that game drawn because if you both selected the same characters the game needs to get drawn okay otherwise I'll say else I'll say if else if you are Q are snake and let me add few more brackets so what are the chances of you winning what are the possibilities that you are going to win what are the possibilities that I should return one if you are snake and computer is say uh computer needs to be water for you to win this is a win situation for you I'll put in another win situation for you or another win situation for you which is going to be let me put in W here for water and U is a variable it says expression must be a modifiable l value what's wrong here okay so this should be double equals to this this will work now so this is a win situation for you another win situation for you is to select water to select water and if computer selects gun by luck you will once again win another win situation for you is going to select gun and in that case computers should select snake for you to win in all these cases you are going to win otherwise you are going to lose so I'll say return minus one minus one for loss okay so let's run this program now and let's see if this program works so if I run this program so it says ENT s for snake let me choose snake it says you lost because computer chose gun my bad once again I'll say water W it says you lose because computer chose snake and it drank your water my bad why am I so unlucky I'll choose snake and it says you win because computer chose water and you drank computer's water now it's asking me for another thing gun game drawn computer also chose gun now once again W you win because computer choose gun and you actually drown computer's gun great great great so this was the game I hope you enjoyed it and uh you can format the you know code as you want I want my code to be very very clean like this I don't want a lot of new lines inside my code which is why I'm formatting it like this so I hope you like this game enjoy playing this game and also play this game with your friends they will also enjoy it you can also refactor this game to play it with your friends so you you can always you know do something so that you you can play this game with your friends so now what I'll do is I'll move on to the next chapter and we are going to explore some more concepts of C so topic of today's string in chapter 8 we are going to learn about strings and strings is something that you are going to use a lot not only in C programming language but in programming in general you're going to use a lot of strings so let's talk about what a string is it's a collection of characters let's talk about string in layman terms what exactly is a string it's a collection of characters so if I write my name here it will be a string so if I say Harry it's a string if I say um let us say John it's a string if I say Kane it's a string okay so you you know what a string is but let's talk about what exactly and how exactly are strings represented in C programming language so this topic is really very important so when I talk about C programming language when I talk about programming a string in C I can say that a string is a 1D character array terminated by a null we know that the collection of items or rather collection of similar items in C programming language is called string so a string is a 1D character um or rather 1D character array terminated by a null character okay so what exactly is a null character so back slash Z it's a null character and we are going to talk about what exactly is this null character and how we can use it but let's let's try to find out how we represent strings and see null character is used to denote string termination characters are stored in continuous memory locations so let us say this is my memory so I'll simply Google array uh oops images and uh let's talk about this image let us say this is a string u b f d a e c one bite is going to take one character and it is indeed taking one character you can see that 200 2001 202 these are contigous memory locations so what exactly is the string if I start reading from here the string can be u in memory it can be U it can be ubf where does this string end I have no idea if I keep on adding character to this string so in order to Mark the ending point of the string we say that wherever you encounter a null character which is back sl0 the string ends there so if after c i store a null character which is nothing but a single character back sl0 is a single character this is something that you need to remember it is not two character it's uh a null character okay back slz is one single character uh which is called a null character it's just that we need to type two characters in the keyboard to type this character but it's actually an escape sequence character uh let me search this for you uh escape sequence so what is back sl0 escape sequence let me also do this so This escape sequence is a single character it it is used to denote string termination okay so I hope that you understood how this uh Works Let's uh try to move further in the notes and let's try to understand more on strings since strg is an array of characters it can be initialized as follows and at this point I'll come to my visual studio code I'll write the first program character array.c I'll put in the boiler plate code I'll zoom in a bit and what I'll do is I'll simply say in ARR or let me call it string let me call it in s str1 so let's say this is St str1 so what I'm doing is I'm saying um uh sorry I need to make it car because string is collection of characters so I'll simply say h I'll simply say a then I'll say R make sure that you are using single quotes because if you're not using single quotes then uh it will not be a character so in order to uh write a character literally in C you need to use single codes do not use double codes if you're coming from a language like JavaScript where single Cotes and double quotes can be interchangeably used do not get confused in C programming language you strictly use a single code for characters okay so h a r r y and this is the last character but no this is not the last character I need to write a back sl0 to tell C compiler that my string ends here I don't have to write anything else after y that's all I needed I needed 3 + 2 five characters but I will need six characters to store the string why do I need need six characters one character for marking the termination of the string one character for storing the null character which is back sl0 so how do I print this now I can print a string by doing print F percentage s and I'll simply write St str1 and yes I I'll be able to print this string so uh let me enable the extension so I'll go to extension I'll enable code Runner by default I I have disabled code Runner so I'll simply enable it in workspace if you can't see this run button install this extension and enable it uh you can see that Harry has been printed on the screen so this is how um strings are represented in memory and this is how you can write a program to um print a string so percentage s is format specifier for Strings okay let's move further in the notes let's see what uh notes are saying so since string is a is an array of characters can be initialized as follows we just did that there is another shortcut for initializing strings in C language okay so this was a bit of a pain because we have to write single quotes and then we have to write these curly brackets yeah this is a bit of a pain so is there any shortcut to Mark a string can I not directly write Harry yes there is a way so in order to directly write Harry you can do something like this you can say int St str1 is equal to double quotes Harry and this will automatically add a back sl0 at the end uh or rather at the end of this character array okay not at the end of this string but at the end of this character ARR so uh in the memory this is actually stored like this so if I save this and run this program I get the same thing which I got by running this this is just a syntactic sugar this is simply uh to make you love this programming language uh to make things easier for you make sure that single quotes are used to Mark a character and double quotes are used to Mark a string so this is how double quotes are used to create strings so let me move further in the notes and let's see what else is there so there is another shortcut we just talked about this and in this case C adds a null character automatically now let's see how strings are represented in memory so one byte is one character in fact one character is one bite and one character just needs a single bite in memory so memory locations are contiguous blocks of memory when we talk about strings or character arrays so what happens is if I want to store Harry I'll simply say h a r r y and at the end will be a null character to Mark the termination of this string so if the memory location of H is 82210 the memory location for a will be 82211 and so on so the next memory location is previous memory location plus one because string uh contains characters and character takes single bite of memory so this is how strings are stored in memory really straightforward let's now talk about this quick quiz where we have to create a string using double codes and print its content using a loop so this quick quiz contains a bit of a catch I mean you don't have to use percentages uh let me say quore quiz. C uh so you can easily print a string by using percentages we just saw that but this question demands you to print the same string using a fall Loop because we know that deep within this particular uh let me enable the extension C++ so C C++ intellisense this was not enabled now it is enabled so I can use the Snippets so what I'll do is I'll use this snippet for for Loop and I'll say in I in I is less than length of the string what is the length of the string I know that length of the string is six because um five for the characters one for the null character and the index will go from 0 to 5 now what I can do is I can do something like this print F percentage C for character and I can say St str1 I this will print the string uh sorry the character so this will first print H then a then R then r then Y and then the null character so let's see how this works so uh oops I I need to remove this so if I run this you can see H then a then R then R then y has been printed so this is how the string is printed so h a r r y has been printed and finally the null character is printed so this is how you can you know solve this question now let's see how strings are printed I just told you how strings are printed a string can be be printed character by character using print F and percentage C so percentage C is the format specifier for printing a character you can print it character by character using percentage C so percentage c will print one single character but there is another convenient way to print strings in C which is percentages we just saw that okay so you can either print a string character by character by iterating this array at the end of the day string is an array and you can also use percentage s if you want to give the address of first element of the array which is St in this case so this will print the entire string how this works behind the hood is this will simply keep on going to the next character next character and so on until it incounters a null character which is back sl0 so I hope that you understood how strings are stored in memory and how to print strings in your C program now let's move to the next topic which is taking string input from the user user how do you take string input from the user taking string input from the user is really very easy all you need to do is use percentage S as the format specifier and you can use scanf so this particular character array can store 50 characters but you can create a string of length five 6 7 34 30 it will be working fine as long as the number of characters in your string are less than 50 because this particular array can hold a maximum of of 50 characters including the N character so this is something that you need to keep in mind so let's take input from the user input strengths. C I'll put down the boilerplate code and I will say car ch1 and let's say the max um the max limit of holding characters for this character array is 45 I write a print here I'll say enter your name okay enter your name and see the magic and also I will write back sln now what I'll do is I'll simply write scanf and percentage D sorry percentage s and I'll say ch1 now I can print the string using printf once again and I can do something like this your name is percentage oops your name is percentage s and ch1 and then if I save this program and show you it is saying enter your name and see the magic it says your name is Harry so this is how this program works let's now move back to notes and read more on it scanf automatically scans uh adds the null character when the enter Keys press so the moment you press the Enter key scanf will automatically add the null character now there are two notes that I've written here the string should be short enough to fit into the error this is something that you need to make sure sometimes c will not throw any error but your program will not work as expected so do not wait for the error you might not get the error you might have uh you know reached a memory location which you are not allowed to reach and maybe due to that you might get some error do not wait for that to happen rather make sure that your strings are able to hold the number of characters you intend to hold okay so scanf cannot be used to input multiword strings with spaces you cannot use scanf uh to input multi-word strings and I'll show you an example so if I run this program and let us say I try to say Harry by you can see that your name is Harry's sprinted and not Harry by so what I want to do is I want to also make sure that my name contains spaces I cannot do this with scanner because the moment scanf sees a space it will actually think that you are done entering the string and you'll not be able to uh print your string or store the string uh as is okay so what is the solution for that we'll see the solution for that and the solution for that is gets and puts so gets is a function which can be used to receive a multi-word string so if you want to receive a multiword string do not use scanf rather use GS so let's create a program here I'll name it 04 uncore gets puts do c I'll put the boiler plate code here I'll close this and also what I'll do is I'll simply copy this program I'll I'll copy this program as is and I'll change this scan of call to get SC can I now add a multi-word string I'll say multi-word string yes it works so I can use gets in place of scanf if I know or if I suspect my string to contain uh one space or more than one space so if you think that your input string might have spaces in it you you might consider using gets okay coming back to the nodes gets is a function which can be used to receive a multi-word string so this is a very basic function it can be used to receive multiword string um there is an example here the entered string is stored in St so St is a character array and gets will make sure that even if your input contains a space your string is stored in the appropriate Place multiple get calls will be needed for multiple strings so if you want to store multiple strings you need multiple get calls likewise puts can be used to Output a string uh you can use puts as well to Output a string prints the string places the cursor on the next line so puts will print the string first and then it will place the cursor on the next line I'll show you so there's a difference between printf and inputs so I'll show you this was using or let me say done printing string so if I'm using print F to print the string let's just print the string and not print the name is so I'll save this program I hope that this will work I just place the semicolon I'll say hey hi so you can see hey hi done printing the string there's no new line here but if I use puts let me show you how puts works I'll simply say ch1 if I use puts the cursor will be placed on the next line so if I say hey hi oops you'll see that hey high and then done printing string is placed on the next line so this puts call will simply place the Curson on the next line so I hope that you understood what is the difference between puts and printf now declaring a string using pointers this is important so we can actually declare strings using pointers like this we can say cashar PTR is equal to Harry this tells the compiler to store the string in memory and assigned addresses stored in a character pointer so uh this will actually uh find some space in the memory and it will give the address of the first character to PTR so PTR will hold the address of H okay I hope that you understood this syntax as well now once a string is defined using this it cannot be reinitialized to something else so if you do something like car St is equal to Harry you cannot change this string but a string defined using pointers can be reinitialized you can say PTR is equal to this or you might want to change it to something else so this is something that you need to keep in your mind now standard Library functions for Strings now C provides a set of standard Library functions for string manipulation you might write your own functions to manipulate your strings but sometimes that might get cumbersome so there are some standard libr functions for string manipulation we'll look into all those standard Library functions some of the most commonly used string functions are St Str Len which will simply give you the length of the string you might want to implement your own s Str Len which will simply scan your character array and it will keep on Counting the number of characters until a back slash Z is encountered okay so you can do that but again there is a builtin function so this function is used to count the number of characters in The String excluding the null character so let me show you so I will simply create a new file I'll say 05 uncore string. C and what I'll do is I'll simply put down the boiler plate Cod code and also I will uh use this syntax to initialize my string now what I'll do is I'll say print F the length of this string is percentage D and I'll say SD Len sd1 so this should actually give me uh the length of this string so if I run this program uh I am getting uh a warning it's telling me that please include this Library this header file so I'll include this header file which is string.h in order to use string Methods you need to include this header file which I've just included this is just a warning your program still works you can see the length of the string is five but again it's a good practice to add the header file when you are working with string functions so the program compiles without any errors and warnings you can see the length of this string is five what if I change change CH this to Harry with with a double y you will see the length of this string is six so in this case the length of the string is six I hope that you are able to uh understand how these things are working now let's talk about the other function which is St strcpy this function is used to copy the content of second string into the first string passed to it so if I have source is equal to Harry and I create a Target I can actually run St strcpy Target source to make Target hold Harry let me show you so um I I I'll create another program I'll say s string sdln I'll create another program 06 uncore string St strcpy and I'm not going to type everything once again I'm going to copy this from here so I'll now say care Target and let me create a Target string with length 45 let me call this source and uh let me do something like this what I'll do is I will say St strcpy and I'll do Target and Source did you notice that when we didn't had the header file we were not getting the suggestion now if I write Str Str I'm getting all these functions uh in the suggestion so this is also one of the reasons to include the header file I'll save this program I'll say the Target string is percentage s and I'll try to print the Target and you'll see that Target now contains Harry so if I run this program Target string is Harry why because this particular string was copied from source to the Target I hope that makes sense coming back to the notes again um St strcpy is something that we just saw Target string should have enough capacity to store The Source string obviously so if I create a string with um with four I'll start seeing weird behaviors you you might not want your program to misbehave so make sure that Target string has U sufficient character limit to hold the source string okay moving on to the next function which is St strcat this function is used to concatenate two strings so if I want to join two strings uh let us say I have S1 and I have S2 S1 contains hello S2 contains Harry and I want um to merge these two strings so if I say s Str cat S1 S2 S1 will now contain hello Harry so let me show this to you s strr cat string concatenation 07 uncore oops SDR cat do c and let me copy this program I I'm starting from this program just to save some time uh so let us say Source contains 56 characters and Target contains this string let's say it contains is a nice boy and I say St cat Source Target so I want to copy everything to source so Source plus Target will be uh assigned to source so so if you want to you know get a rough idea of what is happening this is something which is happening do not take this literally it's it's roughly which is happening so I hope that you understood the gist of it so if I now try to print the source string I'll say Source string is Source The Source string will be changed and it will now contain Harry is a nice boy if I add a space here Harry is a nice boy so Harry is a nice boy okay okay so these two strings are concatenated this is a program to concatenate the string and it will update sord string not the Target string this is something that you need to keep in your mind now the last function that we'll discuss in this chapter is s strcmp and this is last but not the least you might Google some other string functions there are a lot of string functions but these were some of the most important ones now let's see this function is used to compare two strings it returns zero if strings are equal so if you pass two strings and both of the strings are equal this function will return zero negative value of first strings mismatching characters SK Sky value is not greater than second String's corresponding mismatching character so if far comes before joke in the dictionary we'll see a positive value but if that is not the case then we'll see a negative value let me show you so I'll use St strcmp let me show you st strcmp the new program so I'll say 08 _ St strcmp.c I'll start with this uh oops I'll start with this code St strcmp so let us say source and Target are two strings and let me say uh Akash also let me save this program let me remove this and let me say the SDS CMP returns percentage d this will return return an integer so STDs CMP will compare two strings let me compare source and Target so tell me which of these words will come in the dictionary before Akash will be the one that you'll encounter if you turn the pages of dictionary you'll encounter this word before this so what will happen is if I run this program one is returned but in some of the compilers a positive values returns it might be one it might be some other positive value it might be a random positive value but if I change this to a a Harry this word will come in the dictionary before Akash so let me change this to small case let me run this for you this still returns fun because the S key value of uh capital letters is smaller than the SK value of small letters which is why this is happening if I change this to small letter you will encounter minus one and then I'll show you the case oops I selected something and run I need to you know I should not select something and run otherwise it will try to run run that particular snippet and this is the behavior of code Runner what it does is when I'm selecting something it will simply put that code inside temp code Runner do C file and it will try to run it I don't want that so if I make this a a Harry Akash minus one is return because this particular word will now appear in the dictionary before this one okay so this is how this works but let's not see it from the dictionary point of view what we will see it from is we'll see it from the S key value point of view let us see say the Sky value of this character and this character is the same which is now it will check the Sky value of this and this so which Sky value is greater this Sky value is greater so it will return minus one so I hope that you UND understood how this is working what if I make both of these strings as the same what if I make it a a a a zero will be returned so let me show you so zero is returned and this is what I've written in the notes as well I hope that you like this chapter and uh you can now use strings in your program uh if this course was enjoyable make sure you leave a comment below and tell me that this course is something you are enjoying so that I can bring more courses like this in the future but for now we'll move on to chapter 8 practice set and we'll solve some problems on strings let's move on to chapter 8 practice set now so now what we'll do is we'll start with the practice set and uh we'll start discussing the problems in the practice set so this is the practice set which I've created for you and the first question is an McQ it seems which of the following is used to appropriately read a multi-word string and the answer is pretty simple I want you to comment in the uh comment section put the Tim stamp please and tell me which is the correct answer so if you guessed it correctly in fact if you got it correctly the answer is a gets gets is the function which is used to appropriately read a multi-word string in C language so let's move on to the next question so the next question says that write a program to take string as an input from the user using percentage C and percentages confirm that the strings are equal so we need to write a program firstly using percent C format specifier and then using percent s format specifier and we need to confirm that the strings are equal Let's uh try to attempt this problem so what I'll do is I'll create a program number 9 which says 09 uncore p02 doc because this is problem number two so I'll put in the boiler plate code and uh I'll simply say uh let me start with a print F statement what I'll do is I'll say enter the string you want to uh input okay so this is a string that you want to input uh so what I'll do is I'll simply use a fall Loop and I'll say inti is equal to zero and in I is less than five let's assume that the length of the string is five and I'll also add using perent C and uh I'll not write using percent C using percent C because I don't want to print anything here so what we'll do is we'll keep on pressing the enter key and also I'll say enter the string of length five you want to input using person C now what I'll do is I'll simply use my for Loop let me use the all Loop and what I'll do is I'll say scan F person C so we in the first case what we are doing is we are taking the input character by character so I'll say m personent and let me say car I or St where St is a string so let me also say car st5 this will declare a string with name STD of length five um in fact I'll have to make it six because length of the string is five also I need to add a null character to it so I'll keep on doing this and at the end what I'll do is I'll simply say st5 is equal to sd5 is equal to uh null character back sl0 so let me run this program and the moment I run this program and try to enter h a r it it stops me what is happening here why is it not allowing me to enter my name my name is of length five the string can hold five characters what's wrong uh that I'm doing in this program let me explain you the moment I try to run this scanf and I try to store H inside STI which is st0 initially what will happen is I'll press an Enter key and that Enter key will actually be taken by the next scanner which means the next character will be the enter key so what is happening here is so when I say this a for Loop and a scan of inside for Loop listen to this very carefully because this this is very important concept and if I have Scan of inside a loop for Loop while loop or it can be any kind of loop do while loop this scanf will actually take this character whatever I'm typing using my keyboard will be stored inside this so initially I will be zero so inside st0 this particular character whatever is entered by me through the keyboard will be stored but after I press that character I'll definitely press enter key that enter ke key will be catched by ST1 I don't want ST1 to catch that enter key so what I'll do is I'll write F flush STD so what this will do is this will flush that Enter key so the moment I press enter key to finalize the character that I want to store in st0 that Enter key will be removed from the STD ion which means that next time when this runs when this scanf runs for I is equal to 1 it will take the fresh character and not the enter key I hope I was able to explain you this so basically to flush the enter key that we have pressed I have to write this so now if I run this program now I can say h a r r y and yes I can store Harry inside St now what I'll do is I'll simply say comparing this string with Harry gives percentage D and percentage D is nothing but the output of St strr CMP so I'll compare this St string with Harry now let me also include string. H because this is important we discussed this in the last um last chapter in in fact in the same chapter in chapter 8 now if I save this program and if I try to run this program and I enter Harry h e r r y so comparing this string with Harry give zero which means Harry and this string is the same so if I let us say type something else you can see that comparing this string with Harry gives minus one because the string was not the same so this was a bit you know vake question um I hope that I was able to explain you the concepts maybe this statement uh might not lead you to the correct answer but I hope that I was able to explain you some of the concepts write a program to take a string from the the user using percent C and then using percent s so I should have taken it using percent s but that's fine you can we can even use these double codes uh this works as well you can refactor the program in in u the way you want now write your own version of stln function from string. this one is going to be interesting let me tell you so let's Implement Our Own St Str l so 10or pr03 so I'll say pr03 Doc so what I'll do is I'll start with this program so that I have a string and I'll say Care St is equal to Care St is equal to Harry also what I'll do is I'll write my version of St strn and what I'll do inside that St L is I'll return in St Str Len and I'll remove this uh my St let me call it my St L and what I'll take is a character pointer and I'll keep on scanning this character pointer until I encounter a back slash so I'll say cast R PTR is equal to St and I'll keep on incrementing this pointer I'll say while this PTR is not equal to back sl0 so the moment this PTR uh you know turns out to be back sl0 what will happen is this V Loop will stop working so this pointer is currently not equal to or rather I should say starp the value of this pointer should not be equal to back sl0 it should not be null character I'll keep on incrementing this pointer and also I'll keep on uh incrementing length length Plus+ so initially the length will be zero so I'll say in length is equal to zero and I'll return length the moment this uh y Loop exits I'll return uh sorry not zero I'll return length let's see if this works the length of this string is I'll say the length of this string is percentage D and um what I'll do here is I'll simply write the length of this string is perc D and it will be my STL Len and I'll give this particular pointer which is St and let's see if it is able to find the length so if I run this program I'm getting some error I think I forgot some brackets uh so this is the bracket for this okay so now the program should work and it says the length of the string is five let's see if it is able to return the correct answer the length of the string is six yes and if I even further increase my string you'll find the length of the string is 15 so this works this my stln works pretty well I hope you understood how I implemented this let's move on to the next question which is question number four it says write a function slice to slice a string it should change the original string such that it is now the sliced string take M andn as a start and ending point for slice so this question simply says that if your string is this you might want to change this to say this a part of the string so in order to do this what you'll do is you'll keep on copying SDF dsfs into these initial characters and finally what you'll do is you'll terminate the string with back sl0 I want you to take this as a challenge and solve this problem because U we have already wrote a program on swapping um two numbers and reversing an array so this is exactly the same thing I want you to try this on your own and um also try to implement your own version of St strcpy because this is also very simple this is also you know based on arrays we have already solved a lot of problems on array I don't want to repeat um a lot of Concepts that have been already discussed here the next question says that write a program to encrypt a string by adding one to the key values of its character and let me solve this for you uh so this is problem number six so 11 pr06 do c and what I want you to do is change a string such that it is encrypted uh so I'll simply say car name is equal to so so the car name is equal to Harry and I want to change this string so that it is encrypted so I'll use a for Loop I'll say I is equal to Zer I is less than six because um or rather let me make it five because there are five characters I don't want to touch the null character now what I'll do is I'll say name i++ what this will do is this will increment one to the S key value of this character and if I try to print this string I'll say the string is percent s Harry oops name and that's about it if I run this program you'll see the string is IB ssz nobody can tell this is Harry but it's actually g h i a b comes after a then uh s comes after R and Z comes after y so we have kind of you know encrypted the string but this is not um you know SA form of encryption in my opinion uh but again you can use it as some sort of um encryption okay now write a program to encrypt a string by adding one to the skq value of its characters write a program to decrypt the string encrypted using uh this problem so all you have to do is decrypt the string by you know reducing one from the SQ value so this is exactly the same thing all you need to do is you need to say name I minus minus and the problem is solved question number eight says that write a program to count the occurrence of a given character in a string what you need to do in this question is uh you need to count the occurrence of a given character which is um let us say I have a character you can iterate the array and keep on checking whether that character is equal to the uh character of that particular iteration in the string so you can count the number of characters in a given string it's a very basic question you should be able to solve it write a program to check whether a given character is present in a string or not this is even more simpler because all you need to do is iterate the array and once you find that particular character you are looking for you can break out of the loop so even if the length of the string is 17 and the third character in the string is the character that you are looking for you can find that character and break out of the loop you don't have to check further characters I hope that this practice set was pretty simple and the concept of string was exactly the same as the concept of array but once you understand where to put the null character and how all these things work you'll be more comfortable in solving all these questions so I hope that uh this practice set was useful to you now we'll move on to the next chapter and we'll further explore the concepts of C programming language let's move on to chapter 9 now now that we have done so many things in C programming language let's look into structures and this is something that people think is also a complicated topic after pointers but let me tell you something something structure is very beautiful concept when it comes to C programming language if you start understanding what a structure is that will really you know build the foundation of programming Concepts that you are going to hold in the future so the concepts of object oriented programming and the concept of classes and objects that you are going to learn in maybe C C++ Java not in C C++ Java uh JavaScript and so on those kind of Concepts will seem very easy to use so structure is something that was introduced decades ago but still it's going to be very important concept for you so let's try to understand what the structure is so let us say we have a array okay we have an array and we want to store uh two numbers inside that array we can do that right we can create an array and we can start storing all those numbers inside the array and uh that will work but let us say I want to create a collection and inside that collection I want to put a number and a string so if we talk about an array and if we talk about a string what happens inside array is they hold similar data either you can create an array of integers or you can create an array of strings or you can create an array of characters you can create an array of U any any kind of uh you know data type that exist in C programming language but all those data types needs to be same but what if I want to group together together a collection that contains a dissimilar uh you know kind of data for example uh let us say I want to hold a number a name let us say an address a phone number all these kinds of data are not of the same type some of these data types are integers some of these data types are going to be strings some of these data types are going to be uh floating Point numbers as well so what we want to do is we want to group together dissimilar dat data and structure is something that helps us do that so structure is nothing but a way for us to hold the similar data in C programming language so this is something that we need to understand first now let's look into the Syntax for creating structures in C programming language so what I'll do is I'll simply start by writing a program and I'm going to write a very basic program so that you can understand how structures work in C programming language so let me create the very first program and I'll name it structure or struct uh and what I'll do is I'll simply say boilerplate code so that I can put the boiler plate code inside my program now what I'll do is I'll use the syntax and start creating a structure so this a c structure can be created as follows as you can see I've written a struct keyword struct is a keyword that is used to create structures in C programming language then employee is a name chosen by me it is just like a variable in C programming language just like we create in a is equal to 7 we can create int employee equ = to 32 in a very similar fashion what we can do is we can say struct employee and we can start creating this structure so let me show you something what I can do is I can write something like this and I'll say struct employee now I can say in um salary let us say the salary is an integer and what I can also do is uh I can say float hike and these two are um together a different data types integer and floats hike is a floating Point number salary is an integer let us say I also want to create a favorite character of that employee for some Fe reason I want to store uh the favorite character of this employee so all these three types of data types are different okay uh in this example what I've done is I've taken name his name as an array we can do that as well so let me refactor this and let me say that the employee will have some name and that name will be stored inside this variable and it can contain 10 characters at most okay now what I'll do is I'll save this program and you can see here that this declares a new user defined data type so employee is just like an integer now if that makes sense so employee is a data type in C programming language for this program so I can say something like this I can say employee E1 E2 just like I can say int A1 A2 so something which is really very important here is a semicolon I need to put a semicolon in here and if I run this program let me show you something where is my code Runner so I need to enable cc++ extension um I have disabled it by default because uh you know anytime I open some window what happens is it it it it loads all these extensions and my computer starts working slow so what I do is I usually uh disable all these Extensions by default so I'm searching for code Runner I'll enable it for this particular window and I'll close it and I should get this button and once I get this button what will happen is so it is saying that cannot find the PATH uh what's wrong with this structure struct do c uh everything seems to be fine if I run this uh this is not working let me load the visual studio code window once again I don't know what the problem is so I renamed my program and it worked I think I accidentally added a back slash while I was naming the program but anyways it works so if I show you this program it runs without any errors and warnings which means that this syntax works fine so what I've done here is I've created a custom data type now if I want to use this custom data type I'll have to write something like this we can use this user defined data type as follows I can say struct employee even1 now even is an employee so let me show you something I can I can do something like this I can say int a is equal to 45 and I can say struct employee employee Harry and Harry is now a variable of type employee so I'll have to write struct employee completely I cannot say employe Harry uh this is the rule so I can now do something like this I can say harry. name is equal to Harry and I can say Harry do hike is equal to 5.3 I can say let me write Harry here uh I can say Harry dot salary is equal to 10 so I can do something like this okay let me let me add a couple of zeros here okay that sounds good okay so I can say Harry do name is equal to Harry I can do all these things what is it telling me uh it is saying that expression must be a modifiable l value so this is throwing me an error because it is just telling me that uh harry. name is simply the address of the first character of this array and you cannot assign it to Harry so what I'll have to do is I'll do something like this I will uh use St strcpy and I'll simply say name and I'll say Harry do name and then what I'll do is I'll say Harry and this should work and what I'll also do is I'll import string.h now let me run this program and let me show you that this works so I have not done anything so far but let me tell you that I can use all these uh variables from employee structure and I can print them out on the screen let me show you what I mean by that I can do something like this I can say the name of the employee is let me say percentage s and I'll say harry. name then I can also say that the salary of employee is percentage D I can say Harry do salary then I can do percentage F I can say hike of the employee is Harry dohke because Harry's the name of the employee variable just look at this struct employee as a new data type just like you are looking at integers just you are looking at floats look at the struct employee in a very similar manner struct employee can now be used to declare structures or other structure variables of type employee okay so I so Harry is just like a variable the uh only difference between this variable and the variables that we have seen so far is that there are variables inside this variable so Harry has three variables I can use these three values so it's a collection of three different things name salary and Hike okay I hope you understood that there is no other way in C programming language using arrays using string or using some other method to group all these things together so this is something that was brought into the C programming language to solve this problem okay now if I run this program for you uh you will see uh all these things printed on the screen let me also say back sln so that you you know you can see the new line after this is printed so the name of the employees are salary is uh I don't know how many zeros I added a hike of the employee is 5.3 and this is amazing okay because this solved a very big problem for us which was grouping dissimilar types so dissimilar types of data was not grouped by us so far now we can group the similar data types using structures Okay so semicolon is important I have written these notes really very beautifully for you make sure you download all these notes so a structure in C is a collection of variables of different types under a single name so what is that single name single name is Harry Harry is a structure employee type structure which I have created so this is just like a data type this is just like a like in float or double for that matter and Harry is the name of the variable just like a now I haven't used this a but I just wanted to tell you just like we have a we have Harry okay so coming back to the notes let us see what this practice set is telling us write a program to store the details of threee employees from user defined data use the structure declared above so what we want to do is we want to use a bunch of scan fs and a bunch of um printf statements to take the user input and then display it on the screen so let's do this okay let's let's try to do this what we are going to do is we going to use the same program but I'm going to create a new program I'll say quick uncore quiz do c I'll add the uh boiler plate code but I'll not add the boiler plate code I'll simply copy this program what I'll do is I'll simply say Harry then I'll say Kish then I'll say Rohan okay so what I want to do here is I want to take the information from the user so I'll say enter the details for Harry enter the details for Harry now I'll use back sln and I'll also put a semicolon now I'll simply say enter name so let me use U enter name for Harry then I'll say enter salary for Harry then I'll say enter hike for Harry and while I'm doing all this I'll use scan a function I'll simply say scanf and I'll simply say percentage s for the name and I'll say harry. name okay now what I'll do is I'll simply copy this scanf I'll do the same for salary so salary is going to be an integer I know I'm doing a lot of typing but that's because I want you to get this concept very clearly so I'll say percentage F this will take the floating Point number entered by the user and store it into Harry dohke now let me get rid of all these things now I have to do the same thing I have to do the same thing let me get rid of this one because we'll need this one now let me do the same thing for other three employees so let me do control D now I'm copying a lot of code which violates the dry principle so we are not going to worry about that dry principle is nothing but do not repeat yourself dry principle says that do not repeat yourself something that you have already done should be kept by you and it should be reusable in a way that you don't have to reinvent the wheel again and again okay so we are going to do the same thing for Kish I'll replace Harry with kiten and I'll also replace all these structure um variable names now I'll do the same thing for Rohan so let me do the same thing for Rohan I'll say Rohan do name Rohan do salary Rohan doik and we'll also replace all these values with ran okay let me use controls so we have taken user input so far now what we'll do is we'll print all these things so Harry Rohan and kishan okay so these are the three employees okay now what we'll do is we'll print the name salary and all these things for Harry we'll do the same thing for Rohan and we'll do the same thing for kishan so we'll say kishen I'll copy I'll paste I'll paste the salary of the employee of Kion is so I'll have to replace this with kishen I know that's a lot of typing but bear with me I'll quickly do this and also I'll replace all these values with with rans okay so I've used multic cursor functionality of vs code which simply you know can be done by pressing ALT key and clicking wherever you want the cursor so you can press ALT key and you can keep clicking and you'll see the magic of Visual Studio code so let me run this program so it says enter details for Harry enter the name for Harry I want to enter Harry salary is 34 rupees and Hike is 4.2 now the program ended what went wrong let me check let me check what went wrong so enter the hike for Harry uh Harry dohke so I have made a major mistake here so what I'll do is I'll simply use M percent here I forgot to you know take the address of all these variables I'll do the same thing here and I'll not do this same thing for string because um sorry I don't want to put a am percent here I'll simply put an AM percent here and here okay so let me also put the % for um kishan's salary and Harry's salary so let me do the same thing for Harry's salary and also for kishan's salary and Hike so I'll use am perent here and now this program should work so let me run this program U I accidentally selected the program so I'll say enter the name for Harry it's Harry let us say 45 hike can be 5.2 then again it asks the same thing for Rohan salary can be 34 for Rohan and the hike for Rohan is going to be zero I'm very sorry about that uh kishan and then salary 477 he's the richest guy in this company hike is 9.7 and you can see that all these values are printed on the screen so the name of are is are salary of are is 45 hike of are is 5.2 and all these values were stored in a very um compact way because we were using structure uh we could have done the same thing by creating three different salary variables three different hike variables three different name character arrays but we do not want to do that because we want to create an organized pattern to store a data okay so this was a quick quiz now let's talk about why should we use structures why use structures now we can create the data types in the employee structur separately but when the number of properties in a structure increases it becomes difficult for us to create data variables without structures so what happens is let us say we have uh three employees in this case you might think that how about creating three different salary variables three different hike variables and three different name character it is saying name underscore Harry name underscore kishan name underscore Rohan and the same for hore for Harry kishan and Rohan but we didn't do that because in this case we had only three employees but you might encounter a situation wherein you will have say 70,000 employees 880,000 employees in that case it will not make sense for you to create 80,000 70,000 variables okay this was one now the second reason why we are using structure is in this case there are only three data types but what if the number of data types are say 20 or 40 uh now you might be wondering why would there be 40 different types inside a structure but let me tell you something when the complexity of a program increases you will definitely encounter programs with this level of complexity so um I've written it here in a nutshell structures keep the data organized so structures help you keep the data organized structure make data management easy for the programmer just for the reasons I just told you okay now array of structures so we'll talk about array of structures just like we create integer arrays we can create array of structures so what we can do is we can say struct employee Facebook 100 and this structure can hold 100 employees okay just like int a00 can hold 100 integers so this Facebook variable is an array of structures now this might sound really very um confusing to you if you are a beginner but bear with me let me write a program for you so that this this will become you know really easy for you so what I'll do is I'll say array of structs do c I'll put in the boiler plate code let me copy this structure because I'm not going to type this again and again I'll reuse it now what I'll do is I'll say struct employee struct I misses spelled struct and I don't want to use a snipet I want to say struct employee and I can say something like this I can say Facebook and I can say 10 now this array is actually capable of storing 10 different items uh or rather 10 different employees from Facebook company okay now it can be anything uh I just wanted to you know uh present the data in a very meaningful way so that you can understand that we are doing this for employees of Facebook but this can be anything this can be a book this can be uh say uh an electronic equipment wherein you'll have the number of wires the number of circuit connections so it can be any complicated thing but the basics of C programming language and structures are going to be the same okay so what we can do now is we can access the data like this we can say Facebook 0. code Facebook 1. code in this case what I'll do is just like we have created our um our struct employee har what I'll do is I'll simply say uh Facebook z. name I can do something like this so what I'll do is I'll replace all these hares with Facebook zeros okay let me also copy this and let me paste this I'll save it now what I'll do is I will do the same thing that I did in the first program I'll copy these print of statements and before I return I'm going to paste all these uh print of statement to print these values so what I'll do is I will change all these Harry variables to Facebook zero so I can now run this program and show you that Facebook zero was able to store name employee uh sorry name salary and Hike of this employee okay so this is how it works and we can use Facebook one Facebook 2 and facebook0 one and two will uh store different structures okay let me also create a program which will tell you you how we can refactor the program from Quick quiz let me call it quick quiz uh all. C what I want to what I want to do is I want to tell you that the program that we wrote can also be created by say creating an array of three different structures in the form of an array so this particular thing will look like one particular structure but it is not not a single structure just like int a00 is not one integer it's 100 integers this represents three different employees okay so now what I can do is I can replace Harry with Facebook zero so let me do that so I'll say facebook0 so whatever I've written Harry dot I'll replace it with Facebook zero so let me do that for you so wherever I've written Harry dot I will replace it with Facebook zero so let me do replace all but before that I want to make sure that I'm replacing the correct things why am I not replacing Harry and Harry Dot and I'll replace it with Facebook dot uh I am replacing Harry dot because if I replace Harry these things will also get replaced I don't want that so I'm replacing Harry dot with facebook0 DOT replace all I'll do the same for Kish I'll replace it for U with Facebook one and then I'll do the same thing for Rohan I'll say Facebook 2 and this should work okay but there is some error it seems no there is no error in this program let me run this program for you and I want to show you that this will work okay so let me quickly uh type few values and I will do the same thing for Rohan we'll remember that the Rohan salary is 20 rupees okay and hike for Rohan is 2.1 and for Kish name is Kish four and one okay so you can see that all these values are printed just like they were printed in program from or quick quiz okay so this is how you can use arrays uh arrays of structures okay now just like an array of integers an array of loads and an array of characters we can create array of structures just like I showed you and struct employee Facebook 100 will create an array of 100 employees and what is an employee employee is the structure so 100 such entities can be created just using this simple declaration struct employee Facebook 100 okay now we can access the data using this and I have written this in the notes so that you can always come back to the notes and you can access all this syntax also what I'll do is I'll zip all these code files for you and I'll uh give it to you so that you can run any program of your choice anytime you want so we now move into the next topic and we'll talk about initializing structures so how do we initialize our structure so structures can be initialized as follows I've written a Syntax for you we have already made the program uh and I have already opened this particular folder in vs code I guess yes so what I'll do is I'll show you how to initialize structures using a program and it will make it easier for you to understand structure structure inate Doc and in this program I'm going to tell you how to initialize a structure okay so what I'll do is I'll simply come to this particular page and I'll simply say struct employee har is equal to this and what this will do is this will initialize the structure I can directly initialize the structure I'll show you how so what I can do is I can you know copy this program and I'll paste it here and what I'll do now is I will simply get rid of all this all the code which has been written by me in the main but what I'll do is I'll simply say stru employee Harry is equal to I'll say salary is 34 and I'll say 5.2 is the hike and the name is Harry and I'll use a double codes okay now what I'll do is I'll save this particular program and if I run this program for you you'll see that we are getting no errors whatsoever but does this program actually initialize all these values is the question and I'm going to answer this question for you so here is the set of print of statements which were written by me in the previous program to print name salary and Hike of Harry let's see if these values are still working with this particular synex so I'll run this program and you can see that all these uh you know names salary and Hike variables have been initialized properly which means that the syntax works you can also set all the elements to zero so all the elements will be set to zero if you use the syntax so in case you have a set of numbers or you want to initialize a couple of pointers to null what you can do is you can always use this synex and this will initialize all the elements to zero so this was another way to initialize structures we have already seen one of the ways to initialize structure here where we set name salary and Hike manually U using scanf and you know St strcpy now how does structure look in memory is something that you need to understand because if you understand how programs are running in memory you'll be able to easily decode what is happening in the program and it will make you a better programmer for sure so let's see how structures look in memory structures are stored in contigous memory locations for the structure even of typ struct employee memory layout looks something like this so if the address of this particular block is 78 uh 78810 what will happen is this will take four bytes and the address for the next float will start from 78 814 and again it will take 4 bytes the starting address of this particular block which is St storing the string uh storing the name String rather is 78819 so this particular block will have 7888 as the starting address this will have this as a starting address and this integer will have this as a starting address so structures store the data in contiguous memory locations so this is something that you need to keep in your mind in an array of structures these employee instances are stored adjacent to each other so let us say we have a an array of 12 St structures or an array of three structures for that matter what will happen is three structures will be stored in further continuous memory blocks so what will happen is let us say this is my memory let us say this particular row is my memory what will happen is the address will start from here for the first element of the structure so after the ending address of the string will be the starting address of this particular uh what is the salary of the next structure so I hope you got the point so in our continuous memory we'll have the first element of the structure here and the very next thing in the memory will be the second element of the structure array then third element of the structure array and so on so in an array of structures these employee instances are stored Adent to each other I hope you got my point so let's talk about pointers to structures a pointer to structure can be created as follows so you can say struct employee star PTR and PTR is equal to m% E so this index can be used to create a pointer of type struct employee remember I told you just like inte a data type struct employe is also a data type and I can use this struct employee data type to create a pointer of this type so PTR is a pointer of type struct employee PDR is not a pointer of type in or type float or type care for that matter it's a pointer of type struct employee which is a data type a custom data type which is defined by me just like we have int float double all these data types available this is something that we made available for us by writing this structure I hope you got the point now we can print structure elements using print F person D and just like I was using this address of operator this estx operator I can use it with the pointer to structure as well I can say tell me which structure variable is this pointer pointing to and I can decode this address and get the structure and once I get the structure variable I can do do code do name do salary whatever is available in the structure can be you know used by me in this case I don't have anything such code but I have okay I have this code I'm sorry I have not written the code in the program but in this example I have the code in my example I have salary hike and name so I can use do salary doik or do name to get all these things but in this example since we have code here so I'm using dot code so this is how you can you know create pointers to structures and then further dreference them to get the value at those pointers using the star operator now there is something called an arrow operator in C which will make your life a whole lot easier if you are using pointers to structures instead of writing star PTR do code what we can do is we can use Arrow operators to access structure properties as follows but before that let's write a program using pointers to structures okay so what I'll do is I'll simply create another program 06 uncore pointer to structure do c and what I'll do is I'll copy this code inside this particular file and what I'll do is I'll simply create a pointer of type struct employee and what I'll do is I'll set this to the address of Harry Harry is what Harry is a structure of type employee so it's a struct employee variable so struct employee variable Harry now has a pointer PTR which is pointing to this structure so how do I make a pointer point to a variable I simply set it to the address of that variable and PTR will now point to Harry now instead of doing harry. name I can also do something like this let me show you so instead of writing Harry what I can do is I can write um I can write star and I can do uh sorry PTR do name so I can do something like this I can say star PTR do name star PTR do salary and star PTR doik what this will do is this will dreference the pointer and finally after d referencing the pointer what I'll get is I'll get this particular structure so this is something which is very important I'll have to wrap it inside the brackets because this will not work otherwise uh so what we want to do is we want to get the structure first and then we want to do dot name on that structure so what I'll do is I'll replace all this with uh um these blackets so let me copy this paste here paste here and all these uh red underlines which were indicating the error have now vanished now if I run this program you can see the salary of har is 34 and this also prints the salary of are is 34 name is also printed same and the hike is also printed same the difference being this one is using the pointers and this one is using the direct structure so I can either use a pointer and D reference it or I can directly use the variable just like integers and floats we have already seen all these things okay now what we'll do is we'll create another program and our next program is 07 uncore Arrow operator and arrow operator is really very important if you want to go into data structures and you know work with structures you'll definitely use all these things so what I've done here is I've copied the code from pointed to structure program this particular program and I've pasted it here and now I'll tell you how Arrow syntax works so Aros synex is really very easy all you have to do is instead of doing star PTR do name instead of dereferencing a pointer and then getting the value from that structure what you can do is you can directly use the pointer and use the arrow operator which will simply mean that what you want is you want to dreference this pointer and get name from from it so this syntax simply means that you want to dreference this pointer get the structure and then get the name from that structure okay so this syntax is really very simple so I'll use multiple cursors here to create a arrow and I'll simply say PTR salary PTR all these things and this syntax will work let me show you if I run this program you'll see that the name and the salary and the hike have been printed this is the output of this particular thing where I've used directly the variable the structure variable and this is the output from using the pointers I've D referenced the pointer and then I've used a DOT operator dot operator can give me the name salary and Hike from the structure now this is a special syntax that we learned which is the arrow operator so here the C programming language or the C compilers is smart enough to understand that I want to dreference this pointer and get the name from it because I'm using this Aros syntax so this Aros syntax actually makes it really very convenient for users to uh you know dreference the pointer and get a value if you use a lot of pointers in your program uh it will be a big headache to you know dreference those pointers and use dot operators this is a clean syntax and is easy to write easy to read as well as easy to maintain so this was the arrow operator instead of writing star pd. code we can use this Arrow operator to access structure proper properties as follows I can do star PTR do code or I can do something like this okay now here I think I have not written the bracket correctly this bracket should come outside so you need to make a note of this this is the correct syntax I accidentally wrote The Star outside the bracket this will create problems for you so I want you to remove this bracket and put it here so make sure that you do this this is a minor mistake in the notes but again Arrow operator is amazing this is this is why we use Arrow operators we don't want to get into all these things where to put the bracket where to put the star where to put the dot simply use the pointer and say Arrow code and this will give you the code from this structure okay so here this is known as the arrow operator you can use this operator to dreference a pointer and get get the value from the D referenced pointer or the structure okay passing structure to a function can you pass a structure to a function and if yes how how does it look like so a structure can be passed to a function just like any other data type you can pass structure and this is the function prototype so there is a quick quiz I have for you complete this show function to display the content of employee so you need to complete this function and you need to tell me how to write this particular function so what we'll do is we'll simply write this program because this is a very important concept so what I'll do is I'll write a program 08 Qui quiz so I'll say 08 uncore quore quiz. C and inside this particular function what I'll do is um rather inside this program what I'll do is I will copy this structure first and what I'll do is I'll copy this show function so I'll say void show struct employeee so let me write this function void show struct struct employeee now what will happen is if I pass a structure to this particular function that structure will be available inside this function but the question is will that structure be deeply copied or will that structure be passed as a reference so this is something that we'll try to understand in this program so what I'll do is I'll simply the name of employee is um I'll do something like this so I'll say the name of employee is and here also I'll write employee and instead of saying PTR I will say harry. name or e.name so I'll simply say right click change all occurrences I'll make it E do so I'll say e do name e do salary e dohke okay let me save this program and if I create a structure uh is there a program where I've created a structure yes here is a program where I've created a structure I'm simply creating a hariry structure here now what I'll do is I'll simply pass this structure to show function and let's see if it is able to show all these variables and indeed it is able to show we know that but what if I change a particular variable let us say what if I change the hike what if I change the hike of e I'll say e do hike is equal to 45 or 4.55 what if I change the hike to this will this hike change be reflected here as well this is the question also what if I change the name will that change be reflected here so all these questions are important so this hike change will not be reflected here let me show you so what I'll do is instead of doing this I'll simply write harry. name Harry do salary and Harry do hike here and if I run this program you'll see that initially the hike was 5.2 inside the function I tried to change it to 4.55 but it will not be reflected here because all these values are copied what if I try to change e do name what will happen happen there if I try to change e do name let us say I want to change the first character of e do name and let me try to make it P if I try to do something like this inside my function I'll get Parry but after this function returns this change will no longer be reflected in my main function which means that this function is making or receiving the copy of har structure it is not receiving it by reference I I can make it you know go by reference and in that case all these changes will be reflected let me create another show function and what I'll do is this time I'll name it show reference show ref and I'll receive a structure pointer and not a structure and I'll change all these things to Arrow operator because we are dealing with structure pointers so I'll dreference this pointer and I'll get name salary and Hike from it and also here what I'll do is I'll simply say star e.name 0 is Al to P so I can do something like this and here as well I can do something like this okay so star e dohke is equal to this star e. name0 is equal to P all these things can be written like this okay now if I run this program you'll see that here the change is not reflected because I'm calling this show function what if I call show ref and I pass the address address of this structure in this case what will happen is if I try to run this program this change is actually reflected here also the hike change will be reflected so initially the hike change was 5.22 but after I changed it to 4.55 it will be reflected here so all these things are something you need to understand this is basic C logic I would say this is something that you need to understand by now and I hope that all of you understood how these things are working by now now what we'll do is we'll talk about a a keyword which is typ Def keyword and this keyword is a syntactic sugar but really comes very handy now you you all must be thinking that when we have integer data type float data type character data type all these are single word data types I can use int a car b or I can say float C but when we are dealing with structures we have to write the struct we have to write struct complex but there is a way where instead of writing struct employee you can replace all your struct employees with a single word which is employee how how can we do that in this case you can use type def keyword we can use the type def keyword to create an alas name for data types in C typ def is more commonly used with structures type def is used with structure it simply renames the type it it will rename struct complex to complex number so I can say type def struct complex complex number and in this case what I can do is I can say type def let let let me create another program for typ def so I'll say 09 typ def. C and I'll use a very simple program which is here to demonstrate what typ Dev is and how it works so I can say type Dev struct employee I can do all these things and instead of saying employee I can say EMP I can call this EMP now so instead of saying struct employee I can say EMP EMP here as well and no prices for guessing this will work this works so you'll see that we can use EMP to create a pointer as well as to create the structure we no longer need to type struct employee every time we want to create a structure of type employee okay so this comes really very handy when you are dealing with complex programs and uh you know you are frustrated writing Str employee strued employee again and again you no longer need to type Stu employee again and again okay so this is something that you need to understand so in this case what done is I've created a diagram for you I've written the program for you so struct complex C1 C2 for defining complex numbers this is a structure for defining complex numbers now here we we are using type def keyword so instead of using struct complex C1 C2 I can write something like this complex number C1 C2 for defining the complex numbers so I hope that you understood structures well enough and I hope that these notes will help you even further so we'll now move on to chapter chter 9 practice set where we'll see all the questions pertaining to structures let's move on to chapter 9 practice set now so let's now talk about chapter 9 practice set let's look into the questions in this practice set so the question number one says create a two-dimensional Vector using structures in C so we just have to create a two dimensional Vector using structures in C so what I'll do is I'll simply create a program and let me minimize this one I know I have made a lot of programs so what I'll do is I'll simply create a new file say 10or PR 01c and I'll put a boiler plate code here so now what I'll do is I'll simply write a structure I'll use the snippet and I'll say twwo dim vector and I'll say a stuct two dim vector and what I'll do is I'll say int X int Y and that's it this is a twood dimensional Vector now what I'll do is I'll simply create to dim Vector V1 and V2 now I can do something like this I can say V1 is equal to 1A 4 and I can say V is equal to 11 comma 54 let us say and also I can write a program to print these two vectors so just like I have these two integers in X and Y I can simply assign V1 and V2 to 11 54 and 14 now in order to initialize it I will have to write this in a single line and also the same thing for v2 so what I'll do is I'll simply cut this and I'll paste it here now I can save it and run this program and it will work fine but how do I know that it is going to work fine I can simply print I can do something like this print F uh percentage d i plus percentage DJ and what I'll do is I'll say V1 do X and V1 doy I okay and this should print V1 so if I run this program you can say 1 I + 4 J so this is printing a one dimensional two dimensional array if you don't know what a two dimensional array is simply uh consider two dimensional array to be an entity which contains two different integers one is the x- axis one is the y axis so let's move on to the next question now the next question says that write a function some Vector which Returns the sum of two vectors passed to it the vectors must be two dimensional so we have created a two dimension array now we want to create a function which can add such two dimensional arrays if you don't know how to add two two dimensional vectors what we can do is we can add their X components and we can add their y components and the resulting Vector will be the sum of these two vectors so I'll say pr02 Doc also I'll copy this I'll copy this program and I'll paste it here also I'll close other programs I'll say close others I'll save this program so V1 and V2 are two vectors I'll do something I'll say V3 is equal to uh so we have to create a function sum I'll say uh struct to dim V3 is equal to sum of V2 and V V1 and vs2 now sum is a function which will take two vectors which are two dimensional vectors and it will return a structure so I'll say struct two dim Vector sum and this is a function sum is a function and this function is going to do take two two dimensional vectors let us call them X and Y so this will take two two dimensional vectors so what I'll do is I'll create a third twood dimensional Vector here I'll say result and result will contain A and B now what is this A and B A and B are two integers int a a isal to x dox + y dox and B is equal x doy + y doy okay so what is this Vector to make it a bit less confusing what I'll do is I'll call this first and I'll call this one second and instead of writing X dox and Y doy I'll simply write first and second so I'll write first a and I'll write second a so a is the sum of X components from first and the second vectors and B is the sum of Y components of first and second vectors so a is equal to this thing Y is equal to this B is equal to this thing and the resulting Vector is this and I will return result okay now let's see if I'm able to print this Vector just like I was able to print this here so instead of printing this for V1 I'll print it for V3 and I'll see if V3 is the sum of V1 and V2 so I should get 12 and 58 am I getting 12 and 58 yes I'm getting 12 and 58 which means that I'm able to sum these two vectors the sum of these two vectors is going to be 11 and 1 individually summed and 54 and four individually summed which is going to return us 12 I + 58 J okay I hope that makes sense let's now move on to the next question 20 integers are to be stored in memory what will you prefer will you prefer an array of structure this is an important question and you need to think about it and tell me the answer in the comment sections so if you have 20 integers waiting to be stored in the memory what are you going to use are you going to create a structure with 20 different integers or you're going to create an array definitely you are going to create an array because we use structures when we have a collection of dissimilar data types and we use arrays when we have a collection of similar data types 20 integers will be all of type integers and they are a collection of similar data types which is why we will prefer arrays okay the write a program to illustrate the use of Arrow operator in C we have talked enough about it I want you to attempt this program on your own let's move on to question number five write a program with a structure representing a complex number and a complex number will have a real part and a complex part okay just like a two dimensional array we can use real part and complex part to store a comp complex number so let's solve this problem which problem is this this is problem number five so what I'll do is I'll create a program 12core pr05 doc 05. C I'll put in a boilerplate code and what I'll do is I'll copy this structure and instead of making it in this time I'll make it float so I'll say complex I'll make it float real R for real and Float c c for complex so it will have a real part and a complex part and the rest of the things are going to be the same just like our 10th program so it's going to be the same except the fact that instead of taking integers we'll use floats so we'll say percentage F here and instead of saying R uh sorry instead of saying X we'll say R and C real and complex and instead of saying two dim Vector I'm going to use complex which is a name of our structure and this program should work instead of making it four I'm going to make it0 4 let us say 5.4 1.1 and let's see what it returns so 1.1 I + 0.4 J which is true I'm able to print V1 in a very similar way I can print V2 as well so I can print V2 something like this okay so if I print V2 it is going to look something like this I should use back sln to better format it and you can see that I have this 1.1 I + 0.4 J 1.1 I + 5.4 JJ so I hope that you are able to understand how we solve this problem now let's move on to problem number six problem number six says create an array of five complex numbers created in problem five and display them with the help of a display function the values must be taken as an input from the user so you know how scanf works we have already seen uh how to add two numbers you can always create an array we have already seen a program on array of structure so I want you to use those learnings and solve this problem and in a very similar way you can refactor the program to use the typ def keyword we have talked about type def keyword and how it works okay question number eight says that create a structure representing a bank account of a customer What fields did you use and why so in order to create a structure for storing bank account of a customer so I'll say PR it's problem number eight so I'll say PR 08 do c I'll put a boiler plate code here and I'll create a structure bank account so I'll say struct bank and what will I put inside the struct bank I'll say int account number also I'll create a name I'll say a name field for 20 characters I'll say float balance and also I'll say um let us add few more Fields what what else can I add so these are the three things that comes to my mind uh I can also say branch code I can say car branch code and let's let's give it 15 characters and also you can add some other fields um this answer need not be unique you can come up with your Innovative bank which will have uh some of the other fields for the customers okay so this is what came to my mind so I've added these fields so question number eight is done let's solve question number nine now write a structure capable of storing date write a function to compare those dates so this is something that I want you to solve because we have already talked a lot about structures right a structure capable of storing dates what all Fields do you want to store inside a date maybe you want to store month maybe you want to store year also you might want to store a day okay so day month and year and when you're comparing these dates you can one by one compare these three things firstly you will compare the year then you'll compare the month if the year is same then you'll compare the dates so you can easily tell which of the dates are occurring before uh let us say the other date so you can compare two dates and you can tell that which of these dates will appear first in the calendar okay so I want you to solve this problem now I'm aware of the fact that I've skipped most of the problems here and the reason being I want you to practice now because we have already completed nine chapters and we have learned a lot about C programming language so problem number 10 is very easy you have to refactor the program in problem number nine to type def keyword and I know you can do that so with this question we have finished chapter 9 practice set now what we are going to do is we are going to move into chapter number 10 and learn more about the C Concepts let's move on to chapter 10 now so now we'll move on to chapter number 10 and we'll start discussing file.io so the random access memory is volatile and its content is lost once the program terminates so if you are aware of how programs work in a particular computer or in any particular device what happens is the program is first loaded into the memory and that memory is nothing but Ram which is a random access memory and all the content of that random access memory will get lost once the program terminates in order to Pur data forever VI use files so in order to persist the data in order to make the data available later even after the computer is turned off you need to store it in files inside your hard drives you cannot store data in your RAM and uh you know expect it to be available all the time in order to do that you'll have to store your data inside hard disk or some storage device and we store our data in the form of files a file is a data stored in a storage device a c program can talk to the file by reading content from it so a c program can talk to the file by reading content from it and writing content to it so so uh here is a visual diagram I hope you like this programmer C program can write to a file and it can read from a file so a c program can actually write data to a file inside a storage drive it can be a hard drive it can be a USB drive it can be anything your program can talk to this file and perform read and write operations so let's now discuss what a file pointer is a file is a structure which needs to be created for opening the file okay so this is a pointer which needs to be created for opening the file the file pointer a file pointer is a pointer to the structure of the file so a file is a structure and file pointer is a pointer to the structure okay file pointer is needed for communication between the file and the program so if you need to talk to this file you'll have to create a file pointer a file pointer can be created as follows all you need to do is you need to type file St PTR and all you need to do is you need to use this F open function which is available let's create a program which can read a file so I'll say uh read file. C I'll put in the boilerplate code I'll also you know write a sample file.txt and I'll say this is a sample file I'll save this file so what I've done is inside my hard disk at this location uh wherever this folder is open at this location what I've done is I've created this sample file.txt and I've generated some content inside it now what I'm doing is I'm trying to create a a file pointer so I need to keep it in caps I'm saying file star PTR now I'll say PTR is equal to F open the first argument is the name of the file which is sample file.txt and the second argument is the mode okay so all all I need to do is I need to give the mode here so this is the mode and mode is a string so I'll use double codes I'll give read mode now let me show you that this program works I'll save this program and I'll also have to enable C++ extension and also the code Runner so I'll enable these two things I'll also enable code Runner so what I'll do is I'll enable it and what I'll do is I'll simply you know start U with this PTR is equal to fop sample file.txt now let me show you that this program actually works so I'll simply run this program and you can see that this program is not throwing any errors whatso ever which means that this particular program works now we'll see what are the file opening modes in see we have already seen read mode I just showed you read mode we can uh open our file in read mode now let's see what are the other modes available if you want to um if you want to open a file in C so C offers the programmers to select a mode for opening a file so you can either open in read mode either you can open in read binary mode you can also open in write mode you can also open in write binary mode also you can open in upend mode so let's see what are the modes available following modes are primarily used in C file IO so R is open for reading RB is open for reading in binary W is open for writing WB is open for writing in binary a is open for a pen now let me tell you something about read if the file does not does not exist F open returns null so if the file does not exist you will get a null pointer and uh you know what a null pointer is null pointer means it is pointing to nothing so null is a constant in C and if if the pointer is null it means that it is pointing to nothing okay so you can actually check if PDR is equal to equal to null you can perform these kind of checks to find whether a pointer is null or not now let's talk about these open for writing and open for writing in binary if the file exists the content will be overwritten so this is something that you need to be very careful with if you are writing to a file and that file actually exists that file will be overridden so you should be very careful if you are dealing with files that you really care about let us say I write a program and I write a program to use write operation on Sample file.txt I might lose this content if I overwrite this file so this is something that I need to keep in my mind now let's talk about append append simply means U append characters at the end of the file so let us say I'm appending three to this particular file I'll simply add three at the end this is how append works okay so append means add adding content to the end of the file if the file does not exist it will be created this is something that you need to keep in mind as well because if the file does not exist and you have open a file in aend mode the file will actually be created okay so I hope that this makes sense let's talk about types of files primarily there are two types of files text files and binary files text files are the ones which can be opened using notepad and the content of those files can be easily read by human now binary file is a bit tricky some examples of binary files are jpg datat now let's talk about reading a file how do we read a file a file can be opened for reading as follows you can create a pointer you can say PTR is equal to this thing and you can actually use f scanf which is a counterpart of scanf you can use it to read a character or you can use it to read a um let us say a floating Point number for that that matter or an integer for that matter let's read one character from this sample file.txt so in order to read a character what I'll do is I'll create a character and I'll use f scanner function so what I'll do is I'll give this PDR now what I'll do is uh the first argument is the PTR the second argument is the format specifier and third argument is the address of the character so I'll say am person CH now what is the format specified it's percentage C because I'm dealing with characters now what I'll do is if I print this character CH I'll say the character CH is percentage C and if I try to print CH you'll see that first character has been read from the file so the first character was t let us make it h and let's see if the program is able to read H from this particular file yes this program is able to read one character from this file I can actually Loop through this and read all the characters but we are going to talk talk about that later and now what I'll do is at this point I just want you to make sure that you understand how F scanf works and let us assume that harry. txt contains an integer you could have used int num and you could have read an integer as well but in this case my file contained a character so I read this character now I can also read an integer from here so let us say I have an integer 88 and I'm adding a space I can do something like this I can say in I and and instead of doing all this instead of doing all this what I'll do is I'll do inti and then I'll say F scanf PTR and instead of doing percentage C I'll do percentage D and M percent I and I'll say the value of I is I'll say the value of I is what is the value of I percentage d i so I'll say percentage D and I'll say I and this will give me 88 so you can see that I can read an integer from a file as well using this syntax now I have made these notes very carefully so you can always download these notes and revise all the concepts that we are discussing in this chapter now this will read an integer from the file in Num variable in this case it will read it in the I variable okay now coming back to the noes quick quiz modify the program above to check whether the file exists or not before opening the file and how how how would you do that you will simply check whether the pointer is null or not because if the file does not exist F open returns null so you can always uh you know put a check whether uh this thing is null or not if uh your pointer is null this means that the file does not exist let's talk about closing the file it's very important to close the file after read or write this is achieved using App close as follows so whenever you are reading a file and you're pointing a pointer to a file after you are done reading or writing from the file all you need to do is you need to run this app close because you are actually holding that file resource and it is not a good idea to hold a file resource into a pointer forever you need to free it as soon as possible and we use a close PTR to tell the operating system that I am done with this file I no longer need this file this file is no longer opened in this program and this will actually make the file available for other prr programs this will tell the compiler that we are done working with the file and the associated resource could now be freed okay now let's talk about writing to a file we can write to a file in a very similar manner like we read the file you can do something like file star fptr you can write to a file and in order to write to a file you can use f printf instead of F scanf and make sure that you use f close in this case also I'll use f close so I'll say F CL those and then I'll give the PTR and this program will also work fine but let's try to write to a file so I'll say 02 uncore write file. C this program will actually write to a file so what I'll do is I'll create a new file and what I'll do is I'll open it in write mode so I'll say write file okay right file.txt is the name of my file and I'll say in I is equal to 89 and I'll say F print F and I'll say PTR and I'll simply add I to this to this file and let me get rid of this let me run this program and you can see that right file.txt has been created and 89 is now part of this file which means that we were able to successfully write to this file using fprintf so this is how you write to a file now let's let talk about two more functions which are FG C and fput C these two functions are very similar to F scanf and F printf fgc and fput C are used to read and write a character from or to a file uh now if you do FG C PTR this can be used to read a character from file and if you do fput c a character in PTR used to write character C to the file let's see the demo of f get C and FP C so this is program number three and I'll say 0 3core FG C put C.C I'll put the boiler plate code also what I'll do is I'll simply paste all the content of uh this particular file to um to this file I'll open fgc FG cput c. dxt I'll open it in right mode and I'll demonstrate fput C so I'll say fput C and I'll try to add this character to this file so I'll do something like this I'll get rid of this in I is equal to this thing I'll also put a semicolon here and save it so if I run this program you'll see that fput c. txt has been created and this character has been written to this file okay you can do the same thing for FG c as well so now if I want to read this file I can actually do something like this let me get rid of of this and let me replicate it instead of opening it in right mode I'll this time open it in read mode and I'll say F get cptr F get cptr and I'll do something like this and I can print this character I can say print F the value of CHS percentage C CH and this will if I if I run this the value of C is let me spell value correctly the value of CH is C now what if I make this character y y DD L km this will show me why this will read one character now if I do this thing once again if I if I do something like this CH is equal to FG cpdr and I run this again what will happen is two characters will be R so the value of CH is y then again y if I keep on repeating this what will happen is it it will keep on reading further characters from the file so y first one was Y the second one was y third one was D as you can see in this file now it's always a good idea to put a back sln for better readability um if I run this program now it is a bit readable a bit more readable than the previous one so this is how FG C and fput C Works let's talk about end of file character now and gets the return CF when all the characters from a file have been read so we can write a check like below to detect end of the file so what happens is when you are reading using FG C you'll keep on getting the character from the file until EO f is encountered and when eof is encountered it means that there is no further content in the file and you can stop your program there so what we can do is we can say V one and we can keep on reading from this file and we can put a check if CH is equal to eof then break okay so so I I can write a program like this so let me let me read fourth program 04 read all characters C and let me put some underscores here for better readability and let me copy this program so what I was doing here was I was repeatedly saying CH is equal to F get cpdr CH is to F get cbdr instead of doing this repeatedly what I'll do is um let me do something like this car CH and so what I'll do is I'll create a loop for this one so instead of repeatedly doing this I'll create a while loop I'll say V while CH is not equal to eoff so while end of file character is not in counter do this and that's about it the moment end of file character is encountered what will happen is um I will stop reading from the file so let me run this program for you and you can see all the uh you know characters from the file have been read so if I show you this file the last character is M and this one is eoff character okay now this is printing this extra character because this extra character is eof so if you want to get rid of this eof all you all you need to do is you need to print only when the character is not eof so I can put a check here if this CH is not equal to eoff all you need to do is you need to print this okay so I I no longer need c braces because this is just one line so this is something that you can remember if I run this program you can see it's printing starting from um starting from y all the way to M okay so all the characters from this file so this is how you can read all the characters from a given file in C language so when all the content of a file has been read break the loop so this is another implementation of the same thing you can either use this implementation or you can go for this one both of the things will get the job done for you so uh with this we will conclude file IO in C I hope that these notes will be helpful for you also let's move on to chapter 10 practice set to solve some more problems on file IO let's move on to chapter 10 practice set now so now that we have learned so much about file iio let's solve this practice set and let's see what this practice set has to offer for the question number one of this practice set says write a program to read three integers from a file so we have a file we have three integers and we have to read those three integers from the file so what I'll do is I'll open my visual studio code and I'll create a new file I'll say 05 p01 since this is the first question of her practice set I'll create this file as well as I'll put in the boiler plate code I'll also use some of the other files which I've created here to read the integers so I can use f scanf percentage D and in order to use f scanf I'll make use of this read file program so I'll simply create a file pointer to read a string from a file so let's say q1 is the name of the file let me create this q1 txt so that we can have three integers inside this so let me say 12 24 and 36 so we'll remember what integers are there now 12 24 36 let me close this file and what I'll do is I'll keep on reading an integer using F scanner from this file how do we do that we have already seen that we can use f scanf like this and I can store this value inside I so first what I'll do is I'll declare an integer variable which is I and then what I'll do is I'll simply print the first integer using this print F I can do this on repeat and let me show you that this works so if I run this program you can see that the value of I is 12 then 24 then 36 so I can keep on reading from this particular file let me write a back sln just so that we can get a new line character and her output is shown in a formatted way now let's move on to the next question which says write a program to generate multiplication table of a given number in text format now this is something that I want you to attempt because this is very simple you can attempt it using F printf simply use few F printf calls and you should be good to go so please go ahead and attempt this question all you need to do is uh you need to do the same thing that we have done in initial chapters but using F printf instead of printf so I hope you can do this so let's move on to question number three now it says write a program to read a text file character by character and write its content twice in a separate file we have already seen this we have already seen how to read a text file character by character what you have to do is you have to print that particular thing twice so you can read twice or you can simply store it in a character array and you can write it it's your choice totally you can do it however you want all the methods will work let's move on to the next question which is question number four take name and salary of two employees as input from the user and write them to a text file in the following format so let me solve this problem for you so what I'll do is I'll simply create a new file I'll say uh 0 6core p4. C this is problem number four if I'm not wrong yes it's problem number four so what you have to do is you have to read name and salary of two employees so how do we do that I can simply create uh character array and what I'll do is I'll use in to take the salary from the user so I'll use print if I'll say enter the value of salary and yes I'll put a back SL to format the output correctly now I'll use scanf I'll say percentage D so percentage D and M person salary this will give me the value of salary and I'll do the same thing for uh for my name so I'll use percentage s this time and I'll use M perent name uh so let me do it name because name is the um address of this the first element of this character array enter the value of name and I'll get name inside name and salary inside salary so if I want to print the name and salary I can do something like this I can say salary name and you'll see that name and salary will get printed in the output so if I say 45 and I say Harry so 45 and Harry are printed on the screen which confirms that this particular variable now has salary and this particular variable has Harry or the the name entered by the user stored inside of it so what I have to do now is I have to create a file pointer and I have to use this I have to write to a file so what I'll do is I'll copy this program and I'll use this file pointer I'll declare the pointer at the top and um I'll get rid of this integer what I'll do is I'll say F printf and let me also call it q6 do dxt so that you can figure out which question this file is referring to I'll say salary and and and let me see in what fashion this uh particular thing demands to get printed so uh we have to do it for two employees first of all so name one comma salary so let me format it in this way so I'll say percentage s and then I'll use a comma and then salary so I'll say name and salary let me see if this works for one employee and name let me run this program I'll say 34 Harry and let's see if 34 and Harry are written to this file yes Harry 34 are return returned to this file in this manner but we have to do the same thing for two employees not for one employee so instead of calling it name I'll call it name one and also I'll call it name two and salary 2 for the second employee and I'll say enter the value of salary 1 then salary two and we are going to do the same thing for uh sorry name one and then we going to do the same thing for uh name two and salary 2 so let me call this two two two once again to here to here as well and instead of printing the salary I'll directly write it to the file so I'll say name one salary one and also a back sln because I need to get a new line character as well I'll say name two salary 2 let me save this program and let me run this program once I run this program it is asking me for the salary so if I enter this value and I say Harry and then once again the salary for employee 2 is this and name of the employee is Rohan and if I look at this file you'll see that Harry this Rohan this has been printed if you want to get rid of this new line you can remove this new line character from here you'll not get an additional new line at the end but this is how you can write to a file in a specified format okay in this case we wrote all the user input to q6 .txt in this format okay question number five says that write a program to modify a file containing an integer to double its value so in order to do this what you have to do is you have to read the integer from that file and then you'll have to write to the same file with integer multip by two let me show you how this is going to work let's write seventh program which is problem number 5. txt sorry not txt we are going to create a txt file later but for now I I want to create a C file and also in this case we have to read the file as well as write the file so these two programs are very handy sometimes you might forget the syntax so you can use these programs all you have to do is open the file in deed mode first so I'll open the file in deed mode and let me call this file Q Q5 txt just so that you know that this is a file from question number 5 and I'll read an integer from this so I'll say int I and in order to read an integer from this file I'll use this F scanf and I'll use the synex so whatever integers Q5 txt now contains has been St stored inside of I so I now contains the integer which was written inside Q5 txt now I have to open Q5 txt in right mode and what I'll do is I will simply write this particular integer to this file so I'll say F printf instead of scanf I'll write F printf PTR percentage D and I but not I I'll I'll write I multiply by two to this file and also I I'll have close PTR I'll save this file let me create a file Q Q5 txt Q5 txt let's write 45 to this let's run this program if I run this program and if I check Q5 txt 90 is now there so if I run this program once again 180 should be present in the file if I run this program one again uh 360 720 then 1440 uh 1440 and so on okay so this will print double the value inside the file uh it will actually read the file first and then it will write double the value to the same file so I think we have to create a new file in this case but you can always create a new file you can always replace this Q5 with Q5 uncore new and a new file will be created so I hope that you understood how files work with c and how you can read and write files in C programming language in the next chapter we are going to cover a very important topic which is dynamic memory allocation and this topic is going to help you a lot when it comes to data structures and algorithms so make sure that you understand this topic really very well we'll now move on to chapter number 11 and we'll look into dynamic memory allocation let's move on to chapter 11 now now this is going to be the last chapter from this C programming course I have opened this PDF and the name of the topic is dynamic memory allocation really a very important topic if you are going to or if you are planning to go into Data section and algorithms and uh for sure you'll sit for interviews and you are going to prepare for data talk algorithms uh in the near future so let's prepare for that let's talk about dynamic memory allocation so C is a language with some fixed rule of programming for example changing the size of an array is not allowed there are lot of other rules you cannot use single codes for writing strings and so on so we have some fixed rules changing the size of an array is not allowed is one of the rules now why why why have I mentioned this changing the size of an array is not allowed as one of the fixed rules because at times you might want to have a variable sized array but what happens is memory allocation in a program happens before the runtime so so what happens is before the runtime your program reserves some space in the memory and your program operates on that memory but at time what happens is we need dynamic memory now let me explain you what dynamic memory is dynamic memory is the memory that you don't know that you will need but you might need while the program is executing for example you might ask the user for the size of an array now after user tells you the size of an array you want to create an array of that size for the user now user might enter five user might enter 10 user might enter 25 you don't know so you will have to dynamically allocate the memory dynamic memory allocation means that memory allocation will happen during runtime so let's read about dynamic memory allocation from the notes now dynamic memory location is a way to allocate memory to a data structure during the run time we can use dynamic memory allocation functions available in C to allocate and free memory during runtime so what happens is if you are using traditional arrays or integers or character for that matter what happens is memory is allocated in stack now what is a stack whenever a function runs a stack for that function is maintained and all the variables are stored in that stack now you cannot dynamically change the array which is stored inside the stack but what we can do is we can request some memory from the Heap which is another area in the memory and we can dynamically allocate memory from the Heap so what we tell our C compiler is hey C compiler I know we are between the program we are in mid of the program execution but please give me an array of size 20 25 30 a variable size it can be anything the moment you request C compiler for that memory C compiler will go to theat Heap and allocate the memory in the Heap and give you the pointer to that memory now this might s sound very strange to you but let me show this to you we'll write some programs and um we'll learn about some functions that C programming language offers to do the damic memory allocation in C now following functions are available in C to perform dynamic memory allocation the very first function which is available is melck then we have kellock then we have free then we have real looc now if I tell you in very short about all these functions let me tell you maloc is for memory allocation Cog is for contiguous memory allocation we'll see how it is different from Moc U free is used to free the memory in the Heap because if you are uh requesting a memory from the Heap there is some memory which will be already in use because you have a pointer to that memory in the Heap now you want to free that memory in order to tell compiler that I no longer need this memory you are free to provide this memory for other tasks now realloc is used to reallocate memory in the Heap using a pointer now let me show you something what I'll do is I will show you memory layout of Inc I want to show you how this thing is working because if if you don't understand how this thing is working it'll be really very difficult for you to understand dynamic memory allocation so let me open an image here you can see that this is uh your program in memory so this is your RAM now this is high address this is low address uh this is a nice diagram let me open this diagram in a new tab now what I'm going to do is I am going to explain how our program works so what happens is this is stack uh which starts filling from the top this is Heap which starts filling from the bottom and uh we have a text area where the code is stored uh in the memory for our program then there is initialized data uninitialized data now the stack will hold all the variables from different function functions in the program and Heap will contain all the memory which is dynamically allocated how will you allocate memory dynamically from Heap what you do is you allocate the memory in a heap and you request a pointer to that memory and you can now use it in your function from um you can store that pointer in stack and use memory which is available in Heap so I hope that you understood how stack and Heap are working initially we were dealing only with stack but now we realized that we might need some memory for some time during our execution of the program we can request that memory from the Heap dynamically it can be any amount of memory as long as it is available your operating system is ready to give it to you your program will get it okay so we'll come back to the notes and we'll start with the Malo function Malo stands for memory allocation it takes number of bytes to be allocated as an input and returns a pointer of type void so what happens is you can use Malo and then you can use the amount of bytes you want and once you give it this input you'll get a pointer where will this memory be located inside your uh RAM it will be located in Heap make sure that it will be available in Heap you need to understand this concept uh so that you understand how dynamic memory is working okay so let's try to use dynamic memory in our C programs what I'll do is I'll close this one I'll open this particular folder in VSS code I know I'll have to enable CC C++ extension because by default I have turned it off uh I'll enable it okay it's enabled for now which is good and we have code Runner as well let me see if it is enabled as well it is enabled as well which is good uh now what I'll do is I'll create my first program on Malo I'll say Malo Doc and I'll put in the boilerplate code and I'll show you how you can use Malo to allocate memory from Heap now you'll have to use this header file which is m.ed make sure you include this header file now what I'll do is I'll simply say PTR is equal to inst star we are typ casting the pointer what this in star in the brackets does is it will convert the type whichever is supplied here I'm going to use Moc function Moc will return a pointer of type void let me use 30 multiply by size of it and I'll show you what this thing is doing now when I say in Star this is basically converting whatever is coming from this to an integer pointer type okay and MOG 30 multip by size of int will return the amount of bytes consumed by 30 integers now size of is a function which will take a data type and tell you how many bytes that data type is going to take now if you want to store 30 integers you'll have to multiply the amount of bytes taken by by one integer with 30 and you will get the amount of bytes taken by 30 integers maloc will take the amount of bytes and it will supply you a pointer of type void which can be typ casted using in Star if you use in Star MOG 30 into size of in you will get a pointer to the address in Heap which is holding your 30 integers in contigous memory locations if that makes sense so I can now simply say PTR 0 is equal to I can use it as an array I can say PDS 0 is equal to 45 and I can keep on storing values inside this array I can say 46 then 47 I am free to store anything I want ptr2 PTR 3 and I can go all the way till 9 sorry 29 because we have 30 integers now if I do print F percentage D and if I say PTR three or let me do PTR 2 I'll uh I'll use a semicolon you can see for 47 is printed because ptr2 contains 47 so you can use it as an array okay but the um new thing about this particular type of array is that it is not inside stack it is inside Heap it is requested dynamically so I can even say int n is equal to 5 and I can say n into size of int okay I can do something like this and I can create dynamic memory of size five integers inside my Heap now this n can even come from a scanf so if I do scanf percentage D and if I do something like this m percent N I can even Supply 6 7 8 whatever I want from my keyboard and I can then use variable here you cannot do this with arrays you cannot do int I or uh let me show you what I mean by in I Y and you cannot do something like this this this is not valid okay you can see it's throwing uh throwing eror expression must have a constant value and is not a constant so it is saying that it's a variable you cannot use variable okay so you want to create an array dynamically this is how you do it okay so I have also written this inside the notes that we are casting void pointer to in this is space for 30 inss this is size taken by one int so if you want to create an array of characters you can use size of car now why do we use size of function why can't we simply hard code four here you can hardcode four here but it's not a good idea to hardcode a value here because in different architectures integer might take different uh bytes so you don't want to hard Code 4 2 or8 for that matter now the expression returns a null pointer if the memory cannot be allocated so if you request a memory size which your computer fails to allocate you are going to get a null pointer so if PTR is null it means that your memory was not able to U Get allocated by the compiler so here is a quick quiz right a program to create a dynamic array of five floats using myoc so let's solve this quick quiz so what I'll do is I'll say 02 uncore quore quiz. C I'll use the boilerplate code and uh what I'll do is let me let me write uh write program to create a dynamic area of size uh five floats so let me use let me use the same program and I'm going to refactor this what I will do is I will I will simply say 5 n is equal to 5 and I'll say myog 5 into size of float and I'll use float star Moc because uh this is PTR will be a pointer to float this time float and let me not use n let me simply say five here and I can use floating Point numbers here and since I'm using floating Point numbers I'll use percentage F so I can store five floats so I'll say 1 4.18 let me run this program for you 4.7 because ptr2 contains 4.7 so this is how you can use my lock to create a dynamic array of five floats okay let's not talk about Cog function what is Kellog kog stands for continuous allocation it initializes each memory block with a default value of zero so in case of Moc default allocation was not done in this case default value of zero will be initialized to each memory block so you can simply use kellock in this way you can say PTR is equal to float star kellock 30 and comma size of float so this allocates continous space in memory for 30 blocks or for 30 floats okay if the space Cas is not sufficient memory location fails and a null pointer is returned just like in the case of Moc so if null pointer is returned it means that your memory allocation failed now another quick quiz says write a program to create an array of size n using kog where n is an integer entered by the user so n is an integer which is which is going to be entered by the user you'll use scanf and you can simply use this syntax to use kellock so kellock is really very simple let me show this to you let me write this program for you I'll say 03 uncore kog Doc and I'm going to use the same program that I used for malog except the fact that this time I'm going to use scog so I'll say print F enter the size of your array and I'll simply say ERS um I'll say nothing because I've already used this um scanf in the new line so what will happen is this this is an integer pointer this is uh an integer now print F enter the size of your array will be shown on the screen then user will enter the size and then what I'll do is I'll use kellock and kellock takes two arguments first is the uh the number of integers Floats or whatever you want and then the size of one block so it will allocate these many continuous blocks of this size so I want n blocks of size of in which is four in this architecture okay so I can use this to create an array let me come back to the question so size n using KOC where n is an integer so I can enter as large n as possible and this will do the job for me so if I save this program and run this program uh and if I say four 47 is printed so I can allocate an array of size 4 by using this synex as well but by default what will happen is all the blocks will be initialized to zero so if I don't do this I will get zero as the output so if I say four Zer is the output in case of Melo you might or might not get zero as the output but in kellock you will always get zero as the output because all the blocks are initialized with the initial value zero so I have already written it here uh where is it written it's written here okay now let's talk about free function we can use free function to deallocate the memory so if a pointer is holding some memory you can always is use free and that pointer to free that memory in the Heap the memory allocated using kellock Moc is not deallocated automatically so the moment you allocate memory and use it and your program is still running kellock or meloc will keep on holding that memory in Heap now your compiler might do some sort of optimizations from its end but we are talking about C program here and kellock maloc will not deallocate the memory automatically so in that case you'll have to use free function which will release the memory which PTR was holding so if you were holding say 5 in those memory blocks will be freed so here's a quick quiz write a program to demonstrate the usage of free with bck so you are free to write the program it's really very simple simply use the free function and it will deallocate the memory okay now let me let me show you this uh one thing quickly if I allocate the memory uh let me come back to this quick quiz let us say I use this free PTR here so here itself I freed all the memory if I run this program you'll see that nothing is printed so this thing is not printing anything because I've already freed the memory which I was holding okay so this was one weird usage of free you might not want to use free in this way but again you can always use free to release the memory which was held by uh PTR okay now the last function is realloc and it is also really very important because sometimes the dynamically allocated memory is insufficient or more than required so you might want to reallocate uh using the reoc function reoc is used to allocate memory of new size using the previous pointer and size so let us say you were having PTR um and it was holding say four integers and now you want PTR and you want 30 integers you can always use real looc and real looc will give you new memory of your desired size okay so PTR is equal to reoc PTR 3 into size of int will give me a new pointer which is capable of holding three integers so PD now points to this new block of memory capable of storing three integers so this is how real looc works I've written all the syntax in the nodes I hope that uh you like this dynamic memory allocation concept now you might want to dive deeper into dynamic memory allocation by writing programs on your own so practice as much as possible as hard as possible and you'll definitely get this concept sometimes it's very very hard to grasp for beginners the concept of Stack concept of Heap and how a memory layout in of a program in C looks like so I want all of you to search on the internet about the memory layout of C programs how memory layout of C program looks like and then from there you can definitely understand how dynamic memory Works in order to add to our understanding we will solve practice set from chapter 11 let's now move on to chapter 11 practice set and solve some problems so I'll open this chapter 11 practice set for you and inside this chapter 11 we are going to solve few questions so let me open this folder in vs code quickly so I'll open this folder in code and also what I'll do is I'll create program for the very first question because I'm going to solve it no matter what okay so we are going to solve this problem I don't even know what the problem is but I'm going to solve it no matter what it is so the problem says write a program to dynamically create an array of size six capable of storing six integers I think I've already done this program I'll simply use this particular syntax yeah I am a big fan of copy paste by the way and you should be as well it saves a lot of time do not copy from others do not copy with negative intentions but again if your intent is right and the code is yours and the code you coping from is yours you are free to you are in fact more than free to copy the code so I'll simply write six here I'll uh simply create this particular program and run it and this program is capable of storing uh six integers I'll include my log. H and this time if I run it it's not going to run with any errors I'm not going to get any errors and this is the official solution to this problem okay question number two what does it say it says use the ARR in problem number one to store six integers entered by the user let's do it let's do it uh so what I'll do is I'll simply write 05 uncore 05 uncore p 0 2.c and let me close this PDF file I don't know why I opened it at the first place I'll copy this particular code and I'll operate on this this question says that use the array to store six integers so how how will I do that I will simply say PTR 0 is equal to say 1 and then um I'll simply use 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 so I'll say 1 2 3 4 by the way I can go only till five because I have to store six integers and let me give some random numbers here and I'll give it8 this time now let me simply print all these numbers the value at index percentage D is percentage D okay so let's say PTR Z and this is going to be at index Zer okay so 0 PD 0 and I'll do the same for 1 2 three four and so on so let me do it for one let me do it for two then for three then for four then for five this is how you quickly edit uh anything you want in vs code okay oh my God I forgot to put these back SLS and the output is horrible so let me put a back sln for all the printf statements and you can see that all the integers I stored are now visible so at index Zer we have 1 then 4 11 5 88 21 these are the same numbers which we initially assigned or ARR with okay so I hope that you understood how this thing works question number three says solve problem one using kok and yes you can use Kellog so kok is very similar to Melo and you you need to you need to solve it yourself okay this is very simple you just have to change the Melo called to kellock and just look at the syntax of kellock from the uh chapter 11 PDF it's pretty straightforward question number four says that create an array that dynamically capable of storing five integers now use realog so that it can store 10 integers we are going to solve this problem this problem is interesting this is question number four so I'll simply say p4. C and let me start from this program itself so initially this program uh was capable of storing six integers but my question says that create one which is capable of storing five integers let me remove the last element from the AR so this is a program which is capable of storing um with an array with a dynamic array capable of storing five integers now I need to change it to be um you know able to hold 10 integers so how will I do that I'll simply say PTR is equal to I'll use reoc and I'll simply say reoc and then I'll say PTR and new size what is a new size new size is 10 multip by size of end now this array is capable of storing 10 integers so if I run this program you can see that all these integers are visible but now I can write PTR 5 as well now I'll say PTR 5 is equal to and I'll simply punch in some number and I can print PTR 5 here and if I run this code you'll see that index 5 um is 5432 so I'm able to store one more integer and I can store four more yeah this is an array of size 10 so I can store four more okay coming back to the practice set the next question says that create an array of multiplication table of 7 up to 10 so you need to start from one and you need to create a multiplication table of seven from 7 multip by 1 all the way to 7 multip by 10 and then you need to use real loock to make it store 15 numbers so this is a very simple problem of using an array a dynamic array of size 10 and then changing it size to 15 we have already done that so I want you to show some of your creativity and uh start writing this code this is very simple and then once again attempt problem four using Kellog very simple I just need to change this call to kellock and uh when I say kellock I'll simply give the number of bytes sorry the number of blocks and size per block okay so this will give me continuous memory allocation uh I've already told you all this in chapter 11 so in case you think that all these things are something that you're not able to remember all the synex is present uh inside chapter 11 notes so feel free to use chapter 11 notes so this ends this c tutorial I hope you enjoyed this video if you did share it with your friends as well so that they can enjoy this video as well and I hope that uh this will add some value to your lives uh to your programming career make sure you take the copy of these notes I'll give all the links in the description all the programs all the source codes anything that we have done here is completely free available free in the description you can get the link and download it it is absolutely free no condition supply also if you think I should create a new course just let me know I'll be happy to create that course for you I have already uploaded a python course for you so in case you haven't watched my python in one video make sure you watch it so I will simply open my channel and I'll show you where that video is so it says Python tutorial for beginners with noes and this is 11 hours 38 minutes video I hope that you will enjoy this one as well if you enjoy this one also I'm planning for an HTML tutorial with notes so watch out for that as well uh thank you so much guys for watching this video and I will see you next time [Music]"
yvyFzj0C60Y,in a previous video we did some CSS fixes as well as we made our images a static in order to quickly load our website I hope you guys are enjoying this video in this video what we'll do is we'll design peach Nation for the blog now pagination is really an important topic and if you have a lot of pages you'll definitely know the worth of pagination so what I'll do is I'll close all these tabs and just open this playlist and I'll close all the other tabs let me go to Django admin let me show you the structure of the blog page after adding a couple of more blogs so I'll say this is another one first post to let me add few more I'll just add some gibberish here so please don't mind I'm just adding something which doesn't even make any sense but please excuse me for that because I don't want to add something sensible okay so it's saying that please correct the error below there is some error what is the error I don't even know what the error is okay so it's gone now so I'll say jQuery something something something some numbers say I think that should be enough so I've added a few gibberish blocks so 0 of 8 selected let me see how many blocks are added so there are a lot of blocks are added and let us see I want to see only 5 of these ok 1 2 3 4 5 and I want to see you rest of them on the next page okay so I should be able to configure the number of blocks I want to see on this blog homepage how do we do that you must be thinking how to design pagination do we need any library for that do we need to do we need to borrow logic from somewhere I think we can design pagination really very easy so let's try this out and let's add two buttons first of all so what I'll do is I'll come back to my blog home and I'll add two buttons so after the for loop what I'll do is I'll add two buttons so I'll say button dot BT and odd BTN primary now the from the bootstrap frame well you can go to get bootstrap cotton grab your button but since I remember the classes I'm adding them as is so I'll say previous and then I will say next I'll save it let me reload it so previous next I want this next to flow to the right so what I'll do is I can add this to the right so what I'll do is I'll add a div dot row so there are a lot of ways to get this done you can choose any one I'll simply go to bootstrap documentation components or rather I'll dude bootstrap and then I'll say float right let me see if I find something okay so float right is a class in bootstrap I can add float right class to this one and I think this will work float right doesn't work here it doesn't work here because Rho is a Flags box I'll have to remove this class is equal to Rho and rather I'll put my three now if you don't know web development HTML CSS basics let me know if you want me to design a web development series for you guys if you want me to design the series I'm ready to make videos but you'll have to share the channel you'll have to support me and definitely I'll bring a lot of three courses for you so we have this previous button we have this next button so let me go to Internet and I'll say previous HTML code ampersand I think it samples and prev let me see if I can find something previous button next button okay so it's called an e qu o and are aq old P see how it works so l eq u o and are a qo let me see what this gives me reload okay I think this looks good I'll add a space here I will just add a space and this should look fine and I'm not designing it very well I think it should be enough this should be fine so what I've warned is I want to show only repose on one page and I'm going to through rest of the posts on the next page onwards okay so what I'll do is whenever somebody clicks on next I'll pass question mark page is equal to two okay so I'll see a question mark page is equal to two and whenever page is two I've want Gengo to start the pose from say if there are three posts then I want you to start from the fourth post onwards and display three posts from there how to achieve that how to achieve this pagination will have to write the logic so whenever somebody is coming to this blog post page or rather the blog page because this is the blog homepage I'll say number of posts is equal to say 3 now what I'll do is I'll say if a request dot get and let me print request what get page number let me reprint this thing so I'll print this thing so these are the things start you'll not remember over the period of time so you'll have to print and see how this looks so let me see how this low self print request would get and I'll see the console what it prints so whenever I reload this page request would get prints - nari where page is equal to - I think that's fine but what if the page is not equal to - does it print a blank - honey let me find out yes it does and if I try to query it with page number does it throw an error or does it tell me that it doesn't exist or is it none okay so it is none so what I'll do is I'll say if the page number is not set that is if the page number is none I'll say if page is none and what is page page is this thing pH is equal to request dot getparameter what you do is else you set the page to increase your version of page okay so if the page is none you'll set the piece to 1 if the piece is not none you'll set the page to integer version of the page so if I print page here I should get 1 2 3 4 something like that okay so if it is nothing I'll find this one being printed on the console because it's none but if I say question mark page is equal to 3 it will show me the number 3 here it's showing me one I don't know why let me see okay so page number not page I'll say page number rather what I'll do is I'll make in this one page so let me reload this 3 is being printed so the logic works fine so far so I have very cleverly scraped the page from the URL I have this page inside the page URL now how do I fetch the 3 blogs from this page so what I'll do is if the page number is 0 let me let me create the table for you so that you can understand this ok so if the page number is not 0 the page number is 1 what do I want I want the blog posts from 0 to 0 to 3 if the page number is 2 what do I want let me make it : I want the blog from 4 - I want the blog from 4 to 4 5 6 I want to block from 4 to 6 and then when the page number is 3 when I want I want the blog from from piece number 7 to 9 okay I hope you're getting the logic I'm just thinking out loud I just want to think out loud and let you know how I'm thinking so what I'm doing is I'm saying when the page number is 1 I'll fetch the blog post from 0 to 3 when the page number is 2 I'll fetch the blog from 4 to 6 and when the page number is 3 I'll I'll I'll get the blog's from number 7 to number 9 and I'll send it to the HTML page but how do I make it dynamic how do I link it with this page variable so what I'll do is I'll say 0 x Paige and I'll make this one three x or rather I'll say - not - this is a - I'm sorry so 0 x Paige - from 0 x Paige - - Paige okay so if the page number is 3 I'll say from 0 to 3 show all the blog posts now then once again what I'll do is I'll say when the page number is 2 this will be from 0 to 2 which will be a problem so what I'll have to do is I'll have to design it such that this schema fits ok so I'll have to design the formula which fits the schema so I'll have to design a formula which gives me 0 2 3 when the page value is 1 and it gives me 4 - saying so when the value of pages - and it gives me 7 to 9 when the value of page is 3 what is that formula let's find out if I make page x so this thing is a peach x or rather page - 1 x its page - 1 x c2 I think I'm making a mistake here 0 to 3 then 4 5 6 0 it should be 4 to 7 and because 7 minus 4 is 3 3 minus 0 is 3 and 9 minus 7 okay let me make it 8 because see we are adding 3 here so it plus 3 is 11 so I think this is the right combination I'll have to design it this way so what I'll do is I'll say this is page - 1 x - let me see if this fits in so when the page is 1 this works when the page is - this works when the page is 3 when the pages - it doesn't work okay so let us look at it this way I made a mistake here I should write 0 - 3 then 4 to 7 then 8 to 11 how will the first place look like first page will look like 0 to 0 + number of pages okay number of I should say number of posts yeah it's called number of posts let me copy it so it's number of posts so from to zero plus number of posts then when I'm going to the next page what I'll do is I'll see from number of posts to from number of posts to number of posts plus number of posts so from number of pores to number of pores plus number of posts okay then once again from number of posts plus number of posts to number of posts plus number of posts plus number of posts okay so this is how it's going to look like so if I design it in a pythonic manner so zero to three then index three - I'll have to make it three to say three four five zero three then I'll have to add three once again so 3 to 6 and then 6 to 9 okay so 6 7 8 so we are fetching 3 posts at once so this is how it will look in a pythonic way okay so if you are going with numeric way then you'll write 0 to 3 then from 4 to something I'm just trying to think out loud there and I don't want to make the logic and keep it and show you the logic I just want to design the logic in front of you so that you can also learn how to design logic like these so if I think in a pythonic manner the index from 0 to 3 will be shown when the page number is 1 the index from 3 to 6 will be shown when the page number is 2 and when you are slicing a Python list you should know that when you say from 0 to 3 the 3 is excluded and 0 is included when you say 3 2 6 6 is excluded and 3 is included and when you say 6 - 9 9 is excluded in 6 is included so we'll use the Python less slicing okay so this is how I'll write it in a pythonic fee and for page number one this is going to be the condition for page number 2 this is going to be the condition and for page number 3 this is going to be the condition ok so from this much - this much so if I were to design it in terms of the number of posts so I'll make it 2 from a number of posts - number of post multiplied by 2 then multiplied by 3 so here it's multiplied by the number of pages or the piece number okay so what I'll do is I'll write this formula as a page number minus one page number minus 1 this is P number minus 1 because here it's 2 here it's here is 1 2 minus 1 is 1 here it's 2 3 minus 1 is 2 so it's page number minus 1 here and then to page number minus 1 plus 1 that is page number multiplied by number of posts so this is how page nation will work ok so what I'll do is I'll simply slice my list from page number minus 1 to page number x number of posts so if you put page number 1 here it will become from 0 to number of posts if you write 2 here then this will become from 1 okay so I made a mistake once again I should multiply this with number of posts number of posts because this is 1 into number of posts this is 2 into number of posts that is page number minus 1 multiplied by number of posts so this is little bit I should not call it complex because it's pretty straightforward but you might have to spend some time I created this logic on the fly in front of you so it took me some time I don't remember the logic that I create I might have created this logic in the past but once again I created it in front of you so I hope you like the logic and let us see the logic works or not you liking the logic is not as important as chang-ho liking the logic if Django likes the logic this will work and if Chang who doesn't like logic it'll not fall so django should like the logic first okay so let us see if it works so let me see if it is rendering the blocks in this fashion or not so let me reload it saying page number is not defined what is that okay so I should call it page and not page number peach this is page let me see okay reload 1 2 3 4 5 ok so it has disappointed me yet again blocks has equal blocks dot object dot all and when I'm slicing it I think it's it's giving me all the posts so I said number of post is equal to three why is it rendering all the posts there is some problem here so let me reload this once again okay so I'm saying piece number three which is why it's showing me all the posts let me call page number is equal to 1 or 2 1 2 3 4 5 okay I think it works it works number of posts series the number of post is 3 why is it showing me 5 posts it is some problem where when the number of post is 3 and the page number is 2 let us see what formula returns number of posts 3 and page number 2 when number of posts is 3 and page number is 2 okay so I didn't multiply this here my bad I should have written this here as well I know most of you guys must have noticed this while I'm typing but I make these silly mistakes please excuse me for these let me reload and yes it works 1 2 3 and let me see page number is equal to 3 yes it works it works and when page number is 4 nothing is shown so what we'll do now is we'll do one thing we'll add these page numbers to the buttons as well so what I'll do is I'll pass this page to the context okay so I will add the speech to the context or rather what I'll do is I'll add previous and next to the context ok so previous and next and let me call it NXT because next is already a function in Python so let us not mess with that so previous page will be pH minus 1 and next will be page plus 1 but it's not that easy because you know what when your page number is 1 you don't want to return 0 so what you'll do is you will say previous is equal to page minus 1 you'll say if previous is greater than 1 it is greater than 1 then you will say previous is equal to pH minus one else previous will be none there will be no previous same goes with the next if what I'll do is I'll say if next is or rather I should call it page not previous if page is greater than one then previous will be page minus one here what I'll do is I'll say if page is a less than if page is less than some number we'll find that number if page is less than that number then next is equal to next plus one or page plus one I'm sorry if next is equal to h plus one so what is that number when we have say three posts on one page what is that number let's find out so when we have I let me open this blog I think I made a mistake here so let me call it zero so that this loads okay I'll have to add a colon as well let me reload this so it's saying that next has been referenced before the assignment okay so there is a problem and let me fix this when page is greater than one previous is equal to page minus one else previous is equal to none this makes total sense but if page is less than zero what I'll do is next is equal to PS plus one otherwise next is none okay but this will not be zero I'll tell you what it is else and XT is equal to none okay so how many maximum pages will you have how how will you calculate the last page I just want to make sure that this is not the last page page should not be the last page page should be less than the last page what will be the last page the last page will be number of posts that you want to display on one page or or rather what should I say I should say blocks dot objects dot all dot length the total number of blog posts so I'll have to do something like this and here I'll seal in length is equal to blocks length of blocks okay I'll say if page is less than length divided by number of posts now this will give me this will give me something point something if there are four pages that will give me three point something okay so what I'll do is I'll make it see I'll make it seal off length divided by number of posts and I'll have to import math here so math dot C okay so I'm using the C function so C function will make three point six seven it'll convert this to four five point six six will be converted to six let me show you let me show you here this is important to grasp otherwise you will not understand what I'm doing import math mad dot see if it is three point five five four is returned if it is seven point five eight is returned so it is basically returning me the number of pages that my that my blog should have okay number of pages that my dog should have so so the point I want to make here is that if I am showing the last page to my user I don't want my user to navigate to the next page so I'm saying that if page is less than Matt dot seal and let me comment this out because this is not a valid code if the page is less than Matt dot C length divided by number of posts then what I'll do is I'll say okay you are qualified to gather next page otherwise you are not qualified to get a next page and the next is going to be none okay cool so I think I've written this twice no problems ctrl s to save and then what I'll do is I'll come to my blog home dot HTML and what I'll do is I'll say if I'll use F from Jinja and say if previous if the previous is not none if pre means that if the previous is not none then what I'll do is I'll add a href is equal to anchor tag H ref is equal to and I will be adding the previous link here so I'll say previous and then what I'll do is I'll move this thing to to the end of this previous otherwise what I'll do is I'll say else otherwise this thing is going to be this hash so you're not going anywhere you'll remain on the same page there is no previous for you similarly what I'll do is I'll implement the same logic for my for my next let me copy this let me copy this thing control X control V and I'll have to add this float:right class as well because I want it to flow towards the right ctrl s to save and I'll have to add this next so let me copy this anchor tag ctrl V to paste ctrl s and if I reload this you can see that the previous and next is here but there is a problem that this previous is by default being shown as blue color so let me change the color I'll give it a glass of text it's light if I'm not wrong yes it is text light if I'm not wrong let me see if it is text light it should be text light yes it is text light so next is being shown correctly let me add this text light to previous as well so I'll use multi cursor functionality from V s code so what I'm doing is I'm pressing the alt and holding it and wherever I click I'll see a new cursor so I can pace whatever I want and then once again I can click somewhere else to get rid of these multiple cursors okay so I hope that this is making sense now let me reload this it is being shown in previous as well but there is a problem the next is not a valid link here so what I'll do is I'll make sure the logic is correct and at the same time the link should be let me see if I'm referring to the correct variable or not so next is equal to pH plus 1 if page is less than bad dot C length divided by number of posts so let me print length here and see what it prints because this is something that you'll have to test if you're making a logic like this you will have to test it again and again to make sure that it works so it is showing me the page number and the length length is 8 then 8 divided by number of post will be here divided by 3 which will be 2 point something the page will be less than 3 so I think it should show me next is equal to pH plus 1 so let me see what it shows me when I'm going to the next page but it is showing me hash so let me see what what is going wrong here what I'll do is I'll print and I'll panel remove all the print statements wherever I am saying print something I'll remove those statements I'll say print previous and next let me see what previous and next are so for the first page previous has to be hash next should not be hash so next should not be null next is 2 so I think I'm undoing something wrong here so I'm saying if previous said I should say for next year and I should say if NXT here I think it will be right now so let me reload this okay so when I'm reloading this am again not seeing the correct next year so I'll have to make sure that everything is right so I'm saying that if next which means that if next is not null what I'll have to do is I'll say this should be my ok so I'll have to add a char F is equal to I'll have to add the correct H F as well I have not added the corrected affair I'll explain the logic once again so don't worry about it I'll explain you the logic once again I will say / blog / pH is equal to or rather / blog question mark page is equal to this thing and we'll have to add the same thing here as well to make it a lead link reload it and I'll go to the next page peace is equal to - page is equal to 3 and this is the last page so I'm not seeing anything else here so it's hash here so I cannot go further anymore if I come back page number to page number one and then I cannot go any further back okay so I hope that this is making sense to you but how did I do this and how is this logic working let us understand once again because let me be honest here while I was designing the logic on the fly during the video I think it was not very clear what I was doing so let me now explain you what I was doing so we have the number of posts that we wanted okay so let us change the number of close to four let's see if it works so I'll go to blog one two three four let me go to the next page pages one at this point so I should see page number two then I should say no page number three because there are only eight posts inside the database okay previous/next I think we are good okay so let me explain how this thing is working so we have number of posts here and we have page number here number of post is is defined by the user so we can come back to this if you start py and we can change the number of posts to say three or five or six whatever we want to see we can even change it to ten if we want to see ten posts per page but at this point I have made it three so let me made it make it free now what I'll do is I'll find the page number and say do I have the page number in the URL is there any question mark Page is equal to something in the URL now there might be a page there might not be a page if there is a page what I'll do is I'll grab the number of the page but if there is no page which means that the page is none I'll set the page to one that means that the page is one okay otherwise if the page is given in the URL I will type cast it to integer because by default requested ket will return a string okay so you'll have to type casted to integer otherwise you will not be able to perform in teacher operations with this page variable so now the page isn't a teacher now what I'll do is I'll find out the slices for my blog dot object start all the is to grab all the blog posts from the database and then what I'll do is I'll find the number of the blog post that I want to display so the index of the blog post that I want to display on the first page is zero one and two index of the blog posts that I want to see in the next pages 3 4 & 5 because 0 1 2 were displayed on the first page so on the second page I'll see 3 4 & 5 similarly I'll see 6 & 7 on the last page okay so how do I design this let me come back to this logic so what I'm saying is I'm saying that from 0 to 2 should be the number of blog posts that I want to display on the first page 0 1 2 okay now in order to do slicing in Python we'll have to give the first number which has to be inclusive of the index okay so the thing is that when I'm saying blog is equal to blog dot objects start all 0 to 1 it will only give me the first element in the list if I'm saying 0 2 3 it will give me 0 1 & 2 this one is not inclusive this one is also not inclusive this is inclusive of the elements in the list okay so it will give me 0 1 & 2 this will give me 3 4 & 5 this will give me 6 7 & 8 but not 9 okay so these are the number or rather the index of the blog post that I want to pull from the database okay so what I'm doing now is I'm writing these numbers in terms of the pages and the number of post so what I'm doing is I'm saying for the first page I want to take 0 2 0 plus number of posts which is 3 for the second page what I'm doing is I'm taking number of posts - number of posts + number of posts because I want to show the number of posts this - this has to be the number of posts just think about it now after I wrote this I want to write a formula that can generalize this thing the formula that can journalize this thing is page number -1 x number of posts to page number x number of posts and if you subtract this if you do this minus this if you subtract this from this you'll get number of posts ok so you can do that if you want to try you can try that this minus this will be number of posts so you can take this minus this you will find that it is equal to number of posts so we are showing the number of posts number of posts in the page okay in a given page so if the number of posts is 3 we will show three posts on one page so what we are doing now is you're grabbing the length of all the blocks so it can be a tea it can be thousand it can be two thousand gave me ten thousand if you are owning a big blog but at the end of the day what you're doing is you're slicing the block okay you're slicing it and once you slice it it will pull the blog from the database whose index you have given to if you have one thousand blocks in your database and you're saying give me the block from six to nine it will pull six seven and eight for you so at the end of the day you'll have six seven and eight inside the blocks and you're passing it to your blog home dot HTML page and after you pass it to blog home got HTML page you can display it there but I get we need to design pagination as well we need to have some mechanism to get the next page and the previous page now it's pretty simple to get the next page you just add one and it's also very simple to get the previous page you can do page minus one but what if you are on the last page on the last page there should be no next page because if you try to go to the next page you will get some error and we do not want our end user to see any sort of error okay so what we are doing is we are saying that if the page number is greater than one then previous is equal to pH minus one otherwise previous has not paid minus one it is none similarly if pages are less than the last page this is representing the last page number if it is less than the last page number then the space plus one otherwise next is none which means that there is no next page I do not want to display any next page for the user because there is no next page I'll not be able to pull any blog post if I display that page so I don't want to display that page okay now coming back to blog home let me save this file coming back to blog home I am just checking if next is say none then what I am doing is if it is none I am displaying this thing and displaying its ref is equal to hash but if it is not none so you must know that if returns true when it is given a nonzero integer so this will return true whenever next is not none okay so whenever next is not none you will see this which means you will see the next page same goes with previous as well whenever you say if previous you will see the previous page if previous is not none but if previous is none it will go to when previous has done this condition will be false and it will go to else and you will see this okay and you will see that this is working the logic is working and this is the same logic which is used by all the plugins that you might use in beed simple page nation BJ query data tables you might have come across a lot of plugins you can use them there is no problem with that but we can design a very simple P generation logic using this and if you understand this well then I think you can code anything inside your China blog now this was little bit mathematical but I think it was worth it at the end now at the end what I'll do is I'll make these part in smaller in size because I don't want my previous and Next button to look smaller or equal to these buttons so let me come back to button and I'll find the smaller button I'm just looking for a button which looks little smaller than the normal button I think it's called BTN and Sam if I'm not wrong I don't know where it is so I will just simply search BTN SM bootstrap or buttons it's here if I search for SM so it's saying that you can use a small button by adding BTN SM let me add this PD NSM here is my bt and it's here so I'll add this to all the Reid wall and let me see if it works they load okay so this looks little smaller than normal and I think it's totally fine I might as well change this previous and next to green so if I want to do that what I'll do is instead of primary I'll call it success success save it denote it and they are turn to green now so you can design your websites however you want if it doesn't look good to you you can change it or maybe you can make this read more as outline it's totally on you you can design your website however you want to this was not looking good so let me change it - BTN BTN outline I think it's really an outline primary if I'm not wrong let me check I just want to search outlying here I'm looking for outline I'm not looking for BTN okay so BTN outline is the class so BTN outline primary so this is the class let me see how it looks mmm reload okay so this looks fine now I think this looks better another one and whenever I move my cursor to this read more it gets highlighted I think this is fine now I can go to the previous page once again I can go to the next page next page and it's loading really very fast if you use some WordPress or Joomla or some other CMS I think it would be really very slow due to the plugins given the same strength of the server same power CPU and RAM of the server you will find that your Django websites are way better than your WordPress or other CMS websites because you have the entire control Shengo is modern advanced and last but not the least it is PI tonic which is something that we are looking for at this point in 2020 we are looking for something which is pythonic in nature we want something which can give us that feeling of code that we want in this modern times okay so in the next video we'll come back and I hope that you are able to digest the logic that I created in this video but we'll come back in the next video and we'll design the contact page and we'll see how we can create another model and we can save the contact details of a given user and I hope you liked this video and you have access the playlist if you haven't already done that I have only guys to head to this playlist you can go to the

EyEqWFvLDT8,"welcome to this complete python course with handwritten nodes python is the fastest growing language with tons of opportunities in the field of artificial intelligence machine learning and web development my name is Harry and I will be your instructor throughout this course we'll start from the very basic level and we'll then raise the bar like anything the prerequisite of this course is nothing but only your time you just have to come with your time and will together explore the possibilities and the concepts of python if you appreciate this initiative I want you to give this video a thumbs up and drop a comment saying this video is helpful make sure you write a comment for me your feedback really makes me very very happy this course is divided into 13 chapters and three project out of these three projects we have two projects as a games and one of the projects is a Jango jumbo website we learn to make a website in this course as well if I was to suggest you one language that can help you do wide variety of tasks that would be python yes friends that's the beauty of python since the evolution of python a lot of things have changed a lot of operators have been introduced a lot of new Concepts in Python like app strings have been introduced we are going to see the updated concepts of python throughout this course for your ease and help I have also included a cheat sheet with this course I'll give you the PDF of handwritten notes all this for free you don't have to pay me anything for your convenience I have also time stamped this video so that you can see the chapters and navigate to the different parts of this video using the YouTube features after you complete this course you can add all these projects to GitHub and that will definitely help you enhance your portfolio so enough of talks make sure you like this video and let's get started so as you can see that I'm inside this folder on my computer and this is nothing but the set of notes that I've created for you guys you can refer to these notes after you have completed your python learning and it is an amazing material for revision let me tell you so I'll be starting with the chapter zero which contains how you can install python what python is and more importantly what programming in journal is so let's open this PDF as you can see I have this PDF open uh let's discuss about what programming is and then we'll move on to python we'll install Python and we'll take things forward from there so what is programming just like we use Hindi or English to communicate with people so just like we have languages like English Hindi we have French we have German just like we have all these languages to interact with different kind of people we have Python programming language to interact with the computer we have C language to interact with the computer we have Java we have C++ we have JavaScript there are a lot of languages out there which can be used to interact with the computer now let us say I have this pen and you need this black pen urgently what will you say you will say hey harry give me this pen but let us say I want this computer to start recording my screen I cannot simply say hey computer start recording this screen this computer is not going to understand now there are some special programs which can be programmed that way I'm not talking about those I'm talking about the direct instruction if I say send an email to this person to this computer which is not even turned on this is not going to do that so in order to interact with this machine in order to communicate with the computer what I'll have to do is I'll have to write a computer program and I'll have to write this computer program in some sort of programming language so programming is a way to interact with the computer it's a way to instruct the computer to perform various tasks the tasks which computer can perform obviously now what is python python is a simple and easy to understand language and it is one of the most easy to learn one of the most loved and one of the most popular programming languages out there in the market so it is a very interesting language to learn Lear and this is an amazing time to Learn Python and the code written in Python feels as if we are simply reading simple English so it's pretty easy for people to catch up and grasp what python is so this sudo good nature of python makes it easy to learn and understandable by beginners now let's get started with python and let's install python on this computer in order to install python on this computer what I'm going to be doing is I'll simply write install python and I'll simply follow this link python.org downloads this is the official python website and I'll download the python interpreter from here now you can see that I am being welcomed with this python 3.9.4 which is a current version of python let me tell you this might not be the case for you you might see some other version of python the version of pythons keep changing every now and then there is a new version with minor updates and tweaks in the market so no no worries if this version doesn't match in fact there is a high probability that this version will not match when you start downloading python because you might see this video later in the future so let's click on this download python 3.9 and let's run this piece of software you can see that I'm being welcomed with this installed python 3.9.4 64bit now it kind of sensed my operating system and gave me the required file if you are on Mac OS or if you are on Linux you will be welcomed with some other button which will download some other kind of file to your system since I am on Windows this particular website has given me an option to download exe file using this button and I have executed that exe file as you can see after I executed that exe file I can see this popup and I can simply choose options from this popup one of the most important options that I'm going to be checking is ADD python 3.92 path you need to check this check box because I want my python to be available from all the folders inside my computer I'll tell you what it means but just check this option and click on customize installation yes we are going to go ahead with customize installation don't click install now just click customize installation click next and then click this browse button but before clicking this browse button I want you guys to create a folder called python inside your local disc C by default your python will not be installed inside your local DC but let me tell you if you install python inside a folder which is very easily accessible like local DC python you can easily use Python and its resources you can look into the folders you can look into how python works in the future so it's just a great way to install python simply go to this browse button and choose this folder so I'll click this PC local d c and Python and I'll click on okay and then click on install and this will ask me whether I want to install python on my machine or not I'll click yes and this will start installing python on my system I'll wait for a while and this is fairly quick it might take some time on your system just give it some time and setup was successful we have successfully installed python on our computer let's click close And let's see if python works from our Powershell so right click on Windows and click Windows Powershell and once you click on this you will be shown this Windows po shell I'll simply type python here and bang you can see 3.9.4 python is working on this machine now I'll tell you how this python works you can simply play around with python by typing 7 minus 4 which will give me the result which is three and simply say 54 + 7 which is 61 you'll see 61 you can perform basic mathematical calculations python will do it for you but this is not the kind of task we want python to do for us right so let's type exit and opening closing parenthesis to instruct this interpreter to exit now I'll close this window and I'll move ahead with the chapter zero so now we know what programming is we know what python is we have python installed in our system and we'll look into the features of python now it is very easy to understand programming language you'll get to know while we move forward with this course Very less development time is involved with the python applications thanks to the easy to understand syntax it's free and open source it's a high level language it's portable you can either use it on Windows you can tomorrow buy a Mac machine and you can simply use Python there or you can go and buy some Linux machine or you can buy some other OS of your choice and python will just work fine like the way it used to work in your previous machine and it is fun to work with you'll get to know about this one after you make some programs with me so we have already installed python I have simply mentioned that python can be easily installed from python. while you click on the download button python can be installed right after you complete the setup by executing the file on your platform this is fairly simple and straightforward I have demonstrated this for you and I've even mentioned just install it like a game so it's fairly easy and straightforward to install python along with python we want to install another piece of software which is called Visual Studio code and I'll tell you what it is it's simply a modified notepad now I called Visual Studio code a modified notepad just to make things simple Visual Studio code is a source code editor it'll make things easy for you while you writing code in Python now a very simple question you might ask can't I write the code in notepad itself the answer is yes you can you can definitely write python code in notepad itself but it's not a great choice it's not a good idea to use notepad because of the reason reasons I'll mention let's install this Visual Studio code simply open this code. visualstudio code.com and click on Windows since I'm on Windows I'll be clicking on Windows option and you can see that this is downloading let me execute this file and let me run it once I run it on my machine I'll accept the agreement I'll read this agreement and click on next and choose all these options if you haven't already just check whether these options are chosen by default or not if they're not go ahead and check them one by one and I'll tell you what these options will do they'll simply make your life easier in the future don't forget this step just check all these buttons and click next and then click install and this will install Visual Studio code on your computer now many people will ask me that I have already installed Visual Studio code and I haven't checked all those options what do I do you can rerun the same setup and check those options and you'll be just fine but don't forget to check those options we'll simply uncheck this launch Visual Studio code and click finish because I don't want to open Visual Studio code at this point now what is visual studio code what did we just install you might ask let me go to a folder let me go to this particular folder which is Introduction what I'm going to be doing is I will open this folder inside Visual Studio code what does it mean what does it mean to open a folder inside Visual Studio code let me right click here and I'll see this option which I was not seeing in the past which is open with code this is Visual Studio code just click this option and visual studio code will be open with this folder as the context what does it mean if I show you this folder you'll see that this folder contains this file which is chapter 0.pdf and if I show you my visual studio code you can see that chapter 0.pdf is here as well what does it mean it simply means that this folder has been opened inside Visual Studio code I have access to all the files inside this folder through Visual Studio code now let us create a file using visual studio code by clicking on this icon this is simply to create a new file this button is for creating a new folder and this is to refresh the Explorer so whatever is here will be reflected here if you click and most of the times this is auto updated but in case if you have a lot of files inside your folder you need to click this but we'll hardly use it let's create a new file and I'll call it test file.txt and you can see that I'm able to edit this file I can close my terminal or I can open my terminal by clicking on new terminal and this will open a new terminal with this folder as the context this is the same folder which is here I mean the same folder in which Visual Studio code is open just think about how cool is that you'll see this test file.txt if I edit this test file.txt and I type something let us say 1 2 3 4 and if I save you'll see all the changes being reflected here as well so this is truly amazing because whatever is being displayed here is being displayed here and I have a bird I view of all the files inside my folder from VSS code and I also have an integrated terminal inside vs code so if I were to fire any commands from here I can do that I can type Python and this will open the python interpreter I'll close this for now but I just wanted to tell you that you can have all the things that you need inside one single program at one single place you can close them minimize them whenever you want and this particular program is going to make a life a whole lot easier when it comes to coding python programs so we'll see how we'll write a lot of python programs in the coming chapters so this was a basic introduction of python I just wanted you guys to be comfortable with python I hope everybody was able to install python correctly I want to make sure that each and every one of you were able to install python visual stud Studio code and you are able to access my notes correctly so I'll be following these notes all the notes which I've written this was chapter zero we'll be moving to chapter one soon and let's move on to chapter one to discuss more on Python and let's start writing python programs let's move on to chapter one now so let me get started with chapter 1 by opening this PDF which I've created for you so this is the PDF file which I've created for you I am not sure why it's not opening let me reload mode let me open my Google Chrome yet again and yeah it works fine I don't know what what happened in the first go anyways so chapter one is modules comments and pip so let's write a very first Python program and let's create a python file and let's see how python works but much before that what I'm going to be doing is I'll open this particular folder which is 1. chapter 1 in vs code remember we opened this chapter in vs code now we are going to be doing the same thing for chapter 1 so let's right click here and click this open with code option this will open this folder in vs code and I'll see all the files which are present in this particular folder here so I can create a new file here and it will be reflected here we have already seen that we have no doubts about that let's create a file called hello.py and py is an extension that we use for python files now the moment I made a file named hello.py my VSS code is telling me no python interpreter is selected you need to select a python interpreter so you can click either here or either here select python interpreter so let me click here and you can see that I'm getting this option python 3.9.4 so automatically my computer my VSS code has sensed that I have this python.exe installed on my computer so I'll click this and it will select Python 3.9.4 and now this knows that I have python 3.9.4 installed on my machine let me click on this extensions icon and I'll tell you what are the extensions that I'm using so extensions in vs code perform more than what it already does what I mean by that is we can have a python extension and we'll get a lot of convenience options and we can have live server we can have different sort of extensions which does different things we are going to be installing code Runner which is an extension and let me install code Runner code Runner is an extension which helps helps in running a code I have already installed this code Runner and the moment I install this extension I'll see a button right here as you can see I can use this button to run my code let me close this so another option I'm being welcomed with is uh Pence extension my vs code wants me to install pyland extension so let me install this and this basically gives me a lot of features you can have a look at this GIF and you'll see what kind of features you'll get with pyland and gc. collect so you can see that GC was a module and it automatically showed the available options that a person can use with GC we will see what this means and how this is going to help us for now I'll just click install and pance extension is now installed uh it's saying reload this window to activate so I clicked yes and it reloaded my window and my pyin is installed so at this point you should have code Runner installed you should have pyland installed so let me do one thing let me write print and the moment I write print or even PR it shows me print so this is what pance basically does it kind of predicts what I'm going to type so the moment I type PR it predicted that I'm going to type print and if I press enter you can see that print has been written here so if I write hello word in double Cotes you might be thinking why have I used these double Cotes here here bear with me just type whatever I'm writing and you'll be able to follow in the future so for now you just have to type this as is without thinking much about it just type print hello word save this file by clicking contr s on your keyboard and click this button so the moment you click this button you'll have an option to run the code click on run code and you can see that this prints hello word now I'm going to make a change here what I'm going to be doing is I'll click on this gear I'll click on settings and I'll click I'll simply type code Runner and I'll see all these options do you want to clear previous output when you are running a file yes I do want to clear my previous output because if I running a program I want to see the fresh output of that particular program I don't want to see the previous output along with the output of my current program so I'll check this and also what I'll be doing is I want to run my P file in terminal so let me check this one as well code Runner run in terminal so now instead of showing me output window it's going to show me terminal so that I can type further commands if I want to in that terminal so let me tell you what it does let me save it and let me run the code for you and if I run this file you can see that it is directly running in terminal you can also run in terminal by clicking this one run python file in terminal but I you know I I simply run the code in terminal anyway so I changed my setting to run the code in terminal so now if I click run code it will simply run this particular file for me in Python and hello word has been displayed congratulations this was your first program in Python if it was your first ever program right congratulations in the comment it's a great moment for you I hope you are enjoying programming and this is something which is bare minimum in programming whenever you are starting out with the programming language this is the first thing that we do we write hello word programs and you have sucess sucessfully done that in Python let me get back to the PDF that I've created for you let's write a very first Python program create a file called hello.py and P the below code in it we did exactly the same thing we wrote print hello word and let me tell you what print is print is a function in Python we'll read more about functions later but for now let me tell you print something will print that particular something on the output window as you can see that we simply type print hello word and hello word was printed as is in the output window and we are using these double quotes because we want to print hello word as it is we don't want to reference a variable which we'll talk about in this course so let me get back to this PDF and let me talk about how to execute this file so you can execute this file by using Code Runner extension you can also execute a python file by typing python space name of the file so I'll type Python and I'll type the name of the file this can also help me execute the Python program so you don't exactly have to use this extension but it simply makes your job easy you can simply click on this icon and click run code and this will make your job easy and you'll be able to run these kind of code Snippets so any file I want to run I can simply open that file and do this or I can type py t o n Python and then hello. py so I simply pressed h on my keyboard and pressed Tab Key on my keyboard and it autoc completed this to hello.py which made my life a whole lot easier because if I have my program names which are quite longer it'll be convenient for me to use tab so if my program name was let us say chapter 1 practice set.pdf dopy let's assume it was that way so if I type Python and I press C so you can see that it autoc completed it for me so when you type something and you press tab it tries to guess what you want to type so it tries to match all the characters which you have written with this and will try to guess whether you are typing chapter one or you are typing hello or you want to type play so this is Windows feature specifically terminals feature let me get back to the PDF that I've created for you and let's now uh move to modules what modules are so module in a python is a file containing code written by somebody else so this is usually a file which is not written by you you might be an author of the module uh that's why I've written this usually here but in most of the cases if you are beginner and you're using a module you're basically importing somebody else's code which has been written by that person and you can use that code without actually having to know how that code works let me give you an example you are using a phone to make a call to your friends now you don't have to know how that phone exactly works but you are making the call you are able to make the phone call to that friend so since you are making a phone call to that without having to know it you are kind of using that module as a blackbox you are using this phone as a blackbox in a very similar fashion we can import modules in Python which which can help us in doing different kind of work and we can simply use those modules import those modules into a program and we can use those kind of programs so let me show you an example of a module so if I want to show you the example of a module what I'll do is I'll create a python file called mod. py and I will import time so time is a module which can help me to wait for a few second before doing something so time has a function which is sleep and I can specify the number of seconds I want to wait for while this line is executing Let Me Wait for 2 seconds and let me print hello word or let me print 2 seconds have passed since this program ran okay so this is something which I'm printing by the way let me tell you that you can minimize the Explorer if you're running out of space and you have a small monitor you can simply do that and you can also close different files and open different files that's your choice I prefer to just open the file which I'm working with and if I'm working with a framework I simply open the files which I am specifically working with okay so in this program what I'm doing is I'm importing a module named time so time is a module which has a function called sleep I can use that function to wait for 2 seconds and then perform a task so if you want to wait for some time and then perform a task you can use this module let me click here and let me run this code as you can see the program has not end it immediately it has not printed this particular line immediately rather what it has done is it waited for 2 seconds and then it printed this particular line for me let me show it to you once again it is waiting for 2 seconds before it printed 2 seconds have passed since the program Ran So basically this kind of program can be written using modules and there are different kind of modules this was a very simple example of a built-in module I didn't have to do anything to install this module this was already available out of the box and let me talk more about module now so yeah this was all about module you can use somebody else's code and it makes your life a lot easier now let's talk about pip let's talk about what tip is now let us say I authored a module and you want to install that module so if you want to install a module which is authored by me what you can do is you can use pip to install that module so let me give you an example so pip is a package manager for Python and you can use pip to install a module like flask which can help you to build amazing websites or apis now you don't have to know what flask is but this is just an example of a module pip is a package manager which will manage all all sorts of packages like flask or Jango there are tons of other packages as well flask and Jango is one example we can use pip to install a module on your system and it will simply install it and now you'll be able to use it there are two types of modules in Python one is built-in module and the other one is external modules now built-in modules are the modules which are available out of the box you don't have to do anything to get them to your computer you just have to import them as we did here as you can see I imported this time module did I do anything special to get this module to this computer no I simply installed Python and I went ahead with using this module can I do the same thing with flask can I say import flask we know flask is a module we know flask is a module but the moment I say import flask and I try to run this program you can see that I'm getting this error no module named flask so basically my flask module has not been installed on this computer I need to get that module and I can get that module using pip so I can use pip install flask and this will install flask on my computer as you can see so it is getting all the files which it needs and finally it successfully installed all these packages which were required for flask to function properly and now if I click on this run button and click on run code this will execute this particular program without any hassles it will not throw any module not found error as it was throwing in the past so this way what I can do is I can simply install a module get that module and I can import that module to my program and I can make it work so super simple isn't it so let me comment this out and having said that let me also tell you about what comments are so what I basically did here was I pressed control+ for slash on my computer and that commented this line out what it means is simply I can press control for slash on my computer and I can either comment or uncommon a line what is commanding a line means sometimes I want to write something in my program which I don't want to execute for example I want to write waiting for 2 seconds so I basically want to tell user or the programmer which is looking at the code of this program and I'm waiting for 2 seconds here let me wait for 2 seconds here so I'm doing this thing here but if I save this and I try to run this particular code I'm getting syntax error and it is right syntax error is expected here because waiting for 2 seconds is not a syntax this is not valid python code but I want to keep this line here to instruct fellow programmers or developers that I doing this to wait for 2 seconds and I can write something meaningful here like why I'm waiting for 2 seconds what the purpose of this particular line is but I just want to write this so there is a way to write it there is is a way to tell your python interor that I want to keep this line here but ignore this and do not treat this as a source code so if I do this and if I save you can see that I'll be able to run this code successfully so 2 seconds have passed and the program ran so I'm not getting any syntax error which means if I want my python interpreter to ignore something I can use these pound symbols and write something and that will be treated as a comment which means my python interpreter will ignore that particular line or set of lines okay so let me get back to my PDF which I've created for you so some examples of buil-in modu os ABC Etc some examples of external modules are tensor flow flask Etc you can use these external modules sometimes you need to learn specific Concepts before you know diving into these modules for example you need to learn machine learning if you want to get into tens of you need to know what machine learning exactly is why you want to learn machine learning and all those kind of stuff then only you'll be able to use the functions and classes available in tensor flow now we'll get to object-oriented programming in the later chapters but this was the introduction of modules I hope you got what built-in modules are and what external modules are so moving forward let's discuss what rapple is now we have something called RL in Python and it's nothing fancy just the name of RL IS F believe me what we are going to be doing is we'll right click on a start button and open Terminal of Powershell if you are on Linux or you are on Mac feel free to open Powershell or terminal or git bash or whatever terminal you use on your operating system I'm using Powershell so I'll simply type python if you have installed python the right way just like I did you'll see this kind of prompt this prompt is called rapple now what does rapple stands for and what reppel is it's called read evaluate print Loop so what it basically does is you are writing some sort of statements we actually saw one way of executing python programs which is writing Python scripts we create a file we give it py extension and we simply put code inside of that now I'm importing time importing flask all of these lines are executed one at a time one by one from top to the bottom but in case of Rebel what we are doing is we'll keep on typing here and it will keep on getting executed as we press enter for example if I say print and I say hello word and if I do something like this it'll print hello word for me so it's basically executing it it read this statement it executed it it printed it it printed the output whatever the statement returned and finally it once again is ready to accept my input so it's kind of a loop loop it's a loop I'm I'm writing something I'm getting something and once again it's ready to take inputs so it's basically a kind of loop as you can see that I have mentioned about rapple here we can use python as a calculator by typing python enter on the terminal this is my terminal I'm using power shell as my terminal I can use this python as a calculator now once again I again want to emphasize on the fact that we don't want to use Python just as a calculator I know you have calculator in your phone or maybe you might have that scientific calculator that we used to buy at College I hope you have one if you have attended College anyways so basically 3 + 5 is 8 and 7 + 8 is 15 and we can perform multiplication operations we can perform different sort of operations we'll read about operators more and more as we proceed but you can see that it works just like basic mathematic works okay so we can use python as a calculator like this I just wanted to mention about RL so this is r PL and it's not like you'll never use RPL you'll write scripts for complex programs but sometimes let us say you want to see that whether we can use single code or double code in this print statement or not you can simply type it here and you can try it out and let us let us say I want to test single code and I want to see whether this works or not this definitely works so I can use this RL to test something on python so let us say I want to um I want to check whether um X works or not in Python if I say 7x 7x9 will it print 63 or not definitely it will not print but let us assume I want to check it I can check it using RL so since RL is throwing an error I don't have to create a file and then set up visual studio code set up my workspace and then once again python hello.py or whatever the name of the Python file is you don't have to do all that simply open the terminal of your choice type python print enter and you are good to go so this is something which is very very handy when it comes to executing individual python statements as opposed to the entire python script so this is called RL and I've mentioned it in the notes as well now let's talk about comments and discuss about what comments are so comments are used to write something which the programmer does not want to execute so basically you can mark the name of the author you can leave some comments for the fellow program programmers let us say you are leaving the company or you might leave the company you are working for in the future and you want to leave some sort of comments for people who might join in the future you want to write some um say something some kind of behavior about the machine which the particular company is using or let us say you want to type the date when the program was written you can do all that using comments in bython we have already discussed about comments there are two types of comments in bython we have a single line comment and we have a multi-line commment let's discuss about these two kinds of comments and I'll create a file called comments. py and I'll simply say import time time do sleep we now know how sleep function works it will simply wait for one second and let me say print waiting for say 1 second and then once again I'll press controll D to replicate it uh now you can set your shortcuts here in Visual Studio code um keyboard shortcuts and copy line down so for me copy line down isrl plus d you can change this binding by clicking here and if you click here you can enter the desired key combination and press enter so this is some something you can do in your Visual Studio code to customize it for shortcuts I have already customized my control D I don't want to waste a lot of time in explaining Visual Studio code because a lot of people use py charm for Python A lot of people use some other kind of IDE or source code editor edor so I don't want to spend a lot of time in editor but in case you are following along and you are using visual studio code you can have some sort of keyboard shortcuts and once again if you don't want to use keyboard shortcut or if you are not able to understand how keyboard shortcuts or certain thing works in Visual Studio code or if you don't want to spend a lot of time doing all this you can simply select the line copy the line paste the line and waiting for 1 second completed okay so if I run this particular file let me click here and click on run code you can say it waited for a second uh let me run it waited for a second and then the second line prints and the program gets terminated because all the five lines inside the program has been executed if I want to instruct a programmer which might see this script in the future and I want to tell that programmer that hey buddy you can change this delay to something more like 5 seconds or something less like 0.2 seconds in the future so if I write it for him here if I write feel free to change the delay as per the instructions from your boss let us say I want to I I want to add this line for the guy who might see this script in the future as you can see that Visual Studio code has SED that this is not a valid python code it has seen that there are there is some issue with this python script and that this python script might not run in this condition so if I run this code you can see that it is basically complaining that what is this I don't know what feel free is I don't know what to change is I don't know what the delay is I do understand what import time is I can import time I can print this but while scanning the script before executing it it found some syntax error and when when a syntax error is present in your script your script doesn't execute at all during the initial scan python found that these set of words are not valid python code this cannot be tolerated by the python interpreter and it throws an error so what is an option for you you are saying that I want to leave this message for the fellow developer who might see this code in the future or maybe in the next 2 3 days and you really want to tell this to your fellow programmers you can either do this or if you have more lines in your comment if you want to write something else let us say I want to add author date date time if I want to add all these three in my python code I I can simply select all these three lines and press control/ on my keyboard this will make all these three lines as single line comments but in the past when people didn't had the luxury of using these kind of IDs or luxury of using the powerful computers they used to do everything manually and they used to do something like this so this is a multi-line comment in Python you can have these three single codes and you can have the um author and date time or whatever kind of comment you want to put in your python script you can keep it here and your python script will still execute because now you have explicitly told The Interpreter that this line is not a valid python code I don't want you to execute this line I rather want you to ignore these three set of lines and this particular line so these are two ways of telling python that I want to ignore some part of my code so this is a single line comment which is used to ignore single line in the code and this is a multi-line comment which is used to ignore multiple lines in the python source code I hope this is very very clear I hope you understood what I want to say and I hope this is helpful so let's get back to the chapter one and um I hope you understood whatever I told you in chapter one chapter one is completed and I hope you enjoyed chapter 1 let's move on to chapter one practice set now where we are going to practice few questions on chapter one we'll see how comments we'll see how modules and all these things which we have learned in this chapter Works in action let's move on to chapter one practice set now so here is my chapter one practice set which I'm going to be using for this particular practice session of this chapter so write a program to print twinkle twinkle it start St poem in Python and this is straightforward and simple I know you can do that but let me solve it for you let me boost some confidence for you because maybe you are not able to do this maybe you just skim through the chapter one and you are still learning print statement whatever be the case just give it a try and in case if you're not able to solve this question I urge you to still be patient and just keep on listening and you'll definitely be able to code so let me search for this Twinkle Twinkle Little Star poem oops okay so it just popped up Twinkle Twinkle Little Star poem how I wonder what you are let me see if I can get the lyrics and I'm going to be printing all of this one by one okay so let me create a new file I'll say practice it so let me create a file I'll say practice. py and let me paste it right here uh but as you can see that this is giving me some sort of error so if you want to print this poem what you can do is you can simply say print and then you can copy this particular line Twinkle Twinkle Little Star and then once again you can cut this and you can print it once again and you can continue with the entire poem but let me give you another option which is much much much better if you're using visual studio code so now now that we have this particular poem inside a file what I want you to do is I want you to click here just click here bring your cursor to the first line at the starting of the first character now hold all key on your keyboard so you guys have ALT key on your keyboard just hold that and start clicking on twinkle twinkle little star how I wonder what you are so whenever I click I can see that cursor is blinking at that point and if I type something that particular character will be typed on all the cursors can you see that how amazing it is what I'll be doing now is I'll press alt on my keyboard now I'll press shift on my keyboard and then I'll click on line number 12 specifically the very first character of line number 12 and you can see these cursors are appearing at the start of each and every line so if I write print now p r i n t and if I type something like this you can see that I have typed print uh opening parenthesis and double code now if I press end key on my keyboard you can see all these cursors are moving towards the end I can type a closing character like this closing double code character and then I can close all these parenthesis by using closing parenthesis now if I save this you can see that I can run this code and Bam my poem is here so in in case you thought this was a bit of overwhelming I kind of taught you how you can use multic cursor functionality of Visual Studio code multic cursor functionality of Visual Studio code is amazing because it allows you to edit not only at one place but at different places wherever your cursor is placed so I can edit all the commas like this or I can simply you know um select here press alt shift and then I can click here and I can see all the curs have appeared at the starting of the line so I can manipulate however I want but this comes with practice so I want you guys to practice this multi cursor functionality of vs code because this sometimes saves a lot lot lot of time believe me so let me save this file and let me do one more thing so uh I'll close my visual studio code and I'll tell you why in a second but I want to rename all these files and I want to better manage these files so let me number these files in the order in which have written these so 01 02 and 03 so I hope the order is correct but in the future we'll maintain this order 03 this is the fourth program of chapter 1 so let me write 0 4ore and this way you will better be able to manage all the programs after I give you the zip file of this folder content so I'll be zipping all these folders and I'll be providing a link in the description for you to download the content so that you will have access to the noes the practice set and all the programs that we are going to be writing in this course so let's come back to visual studio code I will right click and click on open with code to open this particular folder in vs code and we were on practice so let me rename this and make it practice andore one so this is question number one of the practice set so this is how you write the poem another way of writing the poem is you can simply say print triple quote let me copy the poem once again I lost the poem let me copy it you can paste it and once again you can type triple codes so print twinkle twinkle little star how I wonder what you are you can print all these things and then what you can do is you can close it with the triple code so you cannot do the same thing with double code by the way if you are wondering that will work if you do something like this you will get an error if you're using double code or a single code you will have to close the double code in the same line itself but if you want to print multiple lines you can use triple quotes like this I'll press contrl Z on the keyboard to undo and this is how you can print the poem as well so if I remove this or rather if I press control slash on my keyboard to comment this out you can see that print tnle tinle Little Star the enti poem it will be displayed once I run it so you can see that the effect is very similar except the fact that I'm able to to paste the entire text which I want to print here as opposed to typing each and every line individually I hope you got both the approaches and both the approaches are fine but the second one is a bit cleverer approach first one is also clever in the way that we posted it but again you you need to know both of these approaches and you need to have all the tools in your tool belt let's move on to chapter number uh not chapter number let's move on to question number two now uh where is my practice set here is my practice it so let's move on to the next question of practice it it says use repple and print the table of five using it so let me open reppel I can either use this Powershell control scroll to zoom in I'll control scroll to zoom in for you to see it clearly let me fire python so that you can see the rapple so this is RL read evaluate print Loop okay I need to type five multip by one this is five I can do five mul by 2 I can do 5 multi by 3 4 5 6 and I know that you are not interested in uh watching me type this all the way to 7 8 9 and 10 but let me finish it very very very very quickly so I'll simply use arrow keys and then I'll say 5 multip by 9 and then 5 mtip by 10 and my bad I have entered 5 MTI by 8 twice but you got the point how to use the rapple so this is this is how you can print multiplication table of five but there is a better way to print multiplication table using Loops which we are going to see in the further chapters but for now we have solved the problems you should be happy about that so this is how we solved this particular problem using the tools which we have learned so far so this is not the best way of printing the multiplication table of five let me tell you but we solved it we solved it using Apple so you should be happy uh let's move on to the next question which is install an external module and use it to perform an operation of your interest now this is a very very very generic question you can uh install any module you can install any sort of module and that will do so I've created this file for solving this particular problem and what I'll do is I will be using some module I'll install that module first of all and then I'll show you what we can do using that module okay so let me search on the internet text to speech python so I'll type something and I want python to speak it up okay so let's see if it is possible using this module I just randomly search the internet and I was landed on this page I'll U pip install psx3 I'll try to install this module and hope everything works fine let me install this module and it is collecting pyttsx3 and let me see how to use it in the meantime and let let me copy this and paste it here and let me see if I'm able to make it speak whatever is written here so let me say hey harry I am a python module welcome to the word of python and feel free to replace Harry with your name and this module is installed let me see if it works if it works it'll be amazing it'll be a very good experience for a beginner to listen python module welcome to the world of python wow that was amazing that that was very satisfying because of the fact that we just started learning Python and we are able to do something like that so this is amazing so I'll I I'll tell you how you can customize this particular thing to create a software which can take user input and speak whatever you are typing so that way if you want to remain silent or if for some reason you cannot speak or don't want to speak you can simply use the software to type type something and convey whatever you want to say to a person who doesn't want to read so without texting you are kind of speaking to somebody but you're not actually speaking to somebody because python is doing that job for you I hope you are enjoying this course let me know in the comment section if you are enjoying this course and I'm trying to make it as enjoyable as possible believe me so let's move on to the next question this was amazing this question was very satisfying so it says write a Python program to print the content of a directory using OS module search online for the function which does that so the question mentions that OS is a module OS is a python module and the question asks you search for the function which is able to print the contents of a directory so I have a directory here this is a directory and it has a vs code folder it has hello.py file and a bunch of PDF files along with a mb3 file I want to see what is the content of this folder by using python let's make that program so this is question number four so let me create a file called 06 our six program practice4 because this is our question number four this is our fourth question import o let me see if import OS works that will tell me whether OS is working or not oh I forgot to you know type py so I'll I'll select this I'll click on it and then I'll press f2 and then I can change the name of this file I can also do something like right click rename and I can change the name of the file so you can do whatever you like to rename a file in Python I'll move ahead and run this particular py file as is I'll just try to see if OS works if OS is a module which actually is present on this computer and is working correctly if it doesn't I'll get a module not found error if it does I'll see nothing let's see let's run this file okay so I see nothing I don't see any error if I say import har definitely see error because Harry is not a module in this installed in this particular system so if you create a module named Harry and you installed it that is a different story altogether but I I don't have any module which is called Harry installed on this computer so I'll say run code and I'm getting this module not form error so basically what my Python program is telling me is this module is not present so your better off solving this issue I'm not going to run any further statement so this is what python interpretor is telling you okay so we are importing OS and we'll run it and this works fine so we are happy now we are in search of a function which can print the content of a directory and let me tell you it's called list di now you might not know how listd works but you can print os. listdir and you can simply get all the contents inside a folder so I'll simply show you how this works and you can see that I have all all these files and folders which are present inside this particular directory and I can use this program to print all the files which are present on this particular folder which folder the folder where terminal is running my terminal is running inside this folder 1 do chapter 1 and I can run this program anywhere I can take this file to somewhere else I'll show you if I copy this 6or practice set. py and if I paste it here and now if if I try to run it let me open Powershell here I I press shift on my keyboard and then I press right click um shift right click open Powell window here this will open Powell window here and I can say python 06 and I'll press tab to autocomplete I repeat tab tab key on your keyboard to auto complete press enter key and you can see the story is different now you are seeing the chapters the folders and the files which are present inside this particular folder so so all these chapters are displayed all these folders uh all these chapters which are nothing but Windows folders are being displayed and also this particular file will be displayed this 06 practice 4py because this is also a part of this folder so I'll delete this file from here because I don't want to confuse you I want to keep things organized before I give all the source code to you so this is how you can list all the directory contents using python now the question mentioned that if you don't know the name of that function how do you do that so you simply go to Google and you say os+ or rather Python os+ and then you type list all directory content and you'll be welcomed with a lot of links I TR stack Overflow personally and you can see that this particular function is here with with the answer and this answer has received 5,43 Vols so this this this should definitely work and this worked as we saw so we solved practice um four question four of the practice set let me move to question number five now label the program written in problem four with comments so you can label this program with comments so let me label this program with comments I'll say importing the module importing the module then I'll say function to display all the directory content okay so this is how I can label a program with comments I can also type author author Harry and then organization programming with Harry and so on I I can write date I can write um co-author I can write all those things okay so this this is how you label um label a program with comments okay you can add comments to your program but one suggestion I want to give you here is that you don't have to add useless comments to your program whenever you are writing a program as a programmer you need to ensure that whatever you are writing is useful for the fellow programmers you don't have to write something which is not useful for example writing importing the module is completely useless because when somebody sees import OS they know that you are importing the OS module so you don't have to explicitly mentioned that using a comment you should mention something which the programmer might not know you should not say that I'm printing here because that's so straightforward if you're using print function you're definitely printing okay and even about the os. list di you should not write details about a function inside a program because if somebody wants to know about listd they can go to the OS documentation online and they can you know um come back and have all the knowledge about how list di works what you want to write in your program is how and why your program functions the weight functions and you should add the information which anybody maintaining the code or anybody who is going to improve the code might need so I hope you like this practice set chapter number one is complete and I hope you enjoyed chapter number one let's move on to chapter number two now so let me open this PDF of chapter 2 and let's get started with chapter 2 so I'm going to be opening this chapter 2 PDF and let's talk about variables and data types now what is a variable and what are data types this is something we are going to discuss in this chapter now so far what we have seen is we can create programs like this like this where we are basically executing the line of codes which doesn't include any variable okay so we simply executed a print statement whatever is given to the print statement inside the double quote it will print it as it is is something which we have seen so far now let's close this and let me open this particular folder in vs code so what I'm going to be doing is I will close this and I'll create a new file which is 01 unor variables. py and I'll tell you about variables okay so let me select a python interpreter and let me close this so at home you might be having sugar you might be having rice you might be having some place to store the drinking water now why am I talking about all that you must be thinking like why am I concerned with the place where you're storing your drinking water so I am going to compare these variables with the place or the container where you are storing your water or rice or grains for that matter so variables are basically containers in memory they are basically responsible to store anything which can be used later it can be a number it can be a string it can be a number with decimals let's see what kind of variables we can use so if I come back to my notes I have written a variable is the name given to a memory location in a program so it's basically a container which can store something it's a location in memory which can store something so if I say a is equal to 30 now a has been created as a variable which contains this number which is 30 so 30 is inside a so variables are containers to store a value now you can see B is equal to double quote Harry so whenever I'm writing a double quote I'm basically saying that this is a string and this should be treated as is I'll tell you why we use this double code let me come back to this program if I say a is equal to 34 and if I run this program I'm running this program to ensure that I'm not doing any syntax error I am ensuring that I am not writing something which is syntactically wrong this is valid and this is basically telling python to store 34 inside this variable called a now can I print this a yes I can so I'm printing this a and 34 will be printed on the screen and not a I hope you understood why a is not printed and y34 will be printed so if I run this uh I will have to not select anything and run the code so if you select something and try to run it it basically tries to run that selected part so I'm simply click cing somewhere and I'll simply say run code so that I am actually executing this entire file so a is equal to 34 and if I say print a then 34 is being displayed now let us say you want to display character a on the screen let us say you want to display a as is here you'll say I have written print a if there were no double quotes you'll say I have written a and a is not displayed what's wrong with python so there is a confusion there is a dilemma on what should be printed if somebody writes print a to avoid this sort of dilemma what Python programming language syntax in fores is that if you want to see something as is put it inside a double quote or single quote if I say a now what I'll see on the screen is the literal letter A I'll be seeing this 34 and this line will be printing the letter A let me show it to you so you can see that 34 is printed then a is printed this is printing a number this line is printing a string which is a I can say a duck and if I print this you can see that a duck has been printed so this is kind of how variables work I'll come back to the notes now I can even say C is equal to some decimal number I can say C is equal to 56. 23 and if I print C you can see that I can say print C and this will print this number as is if I run this code so 34 4 a duck and I was expecting some number here which is printed okay so 34 a duck 56.2 3 so I hope you have understood how these kind of things work in Python we can create containers in memory and we can allocate something to be stored in those kind of containers coming back to the notes I have talked about data types so let's talk about data types now what data types are primarily there are following data types in Python we have integers we have floating Point numbers we have strings booleans and none let me talk about all of these briefly and then we'll dive deep into each one of these integers are basically the counting numbers 1 2 3 4 even negative counting numbers are integers min-1 -2 minus 3 are integers zero is an integer now let's talk about floating Point numbers floating Point numbers are real numbers which can be represented in the form of decimals so we can have 34.227399 floating Point number since we have a decimal there 61.22% so let's talk about Boolean sometimes we want to just store the information on whether something happened or not happened so either I am wearing a black shirt or I'm not wearing a black shirt it's a Boolean variable it can be true or it can be false either I'm going to eat the pizza or I'm not going to eat the pizza this is a Boolean variable it can be true or it can be false so booleans are basically used to store either true or false they cannot contain anything other than true or false does they save a lot of memory by doing that so sometimes when we just need to store the information on whether some event is happening or not we use booleans now none in Python is a data type which is used to tell python explicitly that none of these data types are stored in this variable and this variable is not being allocated something so let me show you what it means if I say a is equal to none so if I say or rather D is equal to Capital none and if I print D I'll be seeing none okay so none is something which is nothing so we have a data type for nothing in Python and that is none it is used in a lot of occasions we'll talk about when to use none and when not to but for now just think of none as nothing it doesn't have any data type it's kind of is just none so you can store this particular information that this variable contains nothing using none okay so I hope that you got the point now I'll be opening this noes and we'll talk about integers in details now python is a fantastic language that automatically identifies a type of data for you so if you are coming from a language like C or C++ or Java for that matter you'll have to explicitly mention that I am writing this particular variable as string or I'm writing this particular variable as float or Boolean or even none so in Python you don't have to mention all these things you don't have to mention whether your variable is a string or variable is a floating Point number or Boolean python basically automatically does all those things for you so let me open this file and uh as you can see that while allocating 34 to a we are not writing whether a is an integer or not in a very similar fashion we are not mentioning that c is a floating Point number in a very similar way we are not mentioning um that a duck is a string or I can even say e is equal to a duck and I can print e and I don't have to mention whether e is a string or not python is smart enough to identify that a duck since it's inside double quotes is a string so if I run this particular program you can see 34 a du 56.2 3 none this program executes perfect ly without any errors now we understood how these variables are created we made few of the variables and now we'll understand what kind of names are valid variable names what I mean by that is when we create a variable in Python there is some sort of rules which are imposed when you try to create a variable name and I'll give you an example if I try to create 76 I is equal to 54 or 45 this is not a valid variable name if I try to run this program I'm going to get a synex error and the reason for the syntax error is that this is not a variable name which is valid so what did I do wrong what was the mistake that I committed I'll tell you about it let's come back to the notes and talk about what the rules for defining a variable name in Python and this also applies to other identifiers as I've written here so let's talk about what identifiers are what variables are and what keywords are I have mentioned this in the notes but let's talk about it in detail variable container to store a value as we have already talked about we have already discussed about variables keywords are some of the reserved words in Python which Python programming language has specific meaning of for example none is a keyword and the meaning of none is nothing it is a data type I'll give you another example of a python keyword and it is in in is a keyword for is a keyword while is a keyword and there are a lot of keywords which have different sort of meaning in Python we are not going to use all these keywords as a variable names now let's talk about what identifiers are identifier is something which has been named by us for example I can call this Harry variable as B I can call this 30 variable as a I can name another variable as c i can create a variable name uh number of boxes or number of attempts and so on I can create a lot of variables so something which has been named by the user is identifier I gave that particular thing that particular storage a name so that I can identify it in the future just like your parents have given you a name to identify you and distinguish you from somebody else in a very similar fashion identifiers in Python work now what can be an identified it can be a class it can be a function it can be a variable name we haven't discussed yet about class or function we have discussed about variable names and we are going to continue the Journey of variables in this chapter let's talk about what are the rules for defining a variable name or any identifier for that matter a variable name can be alphabets it can contain digits it it can contain alphabets it can contain underscores a variable name can only start with an alphabet and underscore so the first rule is it can only contain either of alphabets digits or underscores you cannot have any special character in variables so special characters and variables are not allowed you cannot use dollars you cannot use pound symbol you cannot use some other special symbol like exclamation mark at theate these are just not allowed the second rule for creating a variable name is that the variable name can only start with an alphabet and underscore you can either use alphabet or you can use underscore to create a variable name let me show you an example of invalid variable name which violates rule number one and rule number two so rule number one was it should contain alphabets digits or underscores let me get back to my 01 variables. py file and let's try to create a a variable which doesn't contain just alphabet numbers of symbol so if I try to create this variable you'll see that I'm getting syntax error ERS is just not allowed because it is a special character star is not allowed in a very similar way just like erson was not allowed start is also not allowed so let me save this before running and you can see that it's inv valid syntax once again if I try pound symbol I'll get an error and you can see that if I try a pound symbol it's saying ik is not defined so basically when I use or try to use pound symbol it is getting confused and it is thinking that I'm trying to write a comment but I was trying to create a variable with pound symbol so these things are just not allowed your variable name should only contain alphabets digits and underscores let's talk about another rule of variable names which is it can only start with an alphabet and underscore now let us assume that my variable contains alphabet digit it's an underscores let's create a variable let's say ik ik is a variable which is valid and I can show you by running this program that it just works fine no problem whatsoever I'm not getting any syntax error or anything but if I try to make it five I if I start the name of this identifier with a number it's not allowed I cannot use this I cannot use number to start I can definitely have number here or here for that matter I can do that but I cannot start start my variable name with a number it's not allowed if I try to do that I'll get a syntax error you can see I'll get a syntax error this is invalid syntax it's telling me it's telling me that you cannot just use five as starting character of a variable name okay so I hope you got the point I'll remove this and I'll show you that five here works and five here also works and this is just fine this is working just fine because it's not starting with any number it's just not violating any rule which I talked about uh for creating variable names the third rule is it can't start with a digit it just cannot start with a digit it can only start with the alphabet or an underscore okay so uh no whites space is allowed to be used inside a variable name you cannot use whites space because if you try to use whitespace you are going to get an error and the reason is that python wants your identifier to be separated from other part of the synex a whitespace is sometimes used as a part of syntax in Python and python doesn't want its users or its internal mechanism to get confused with what is a variable and what is a whitespace so it doesn't allow you to keep whitespace inside variable names I hope this is clear and this was very straightforward so these were some of the rules for creating a variable name and uh we can now see some of the valid variable names I have given example of some of the variable names Harry is a variable name it's valid 18 is a variable name it's valid 7core is valid underscore 7 is valid and so on okay you can have a lot of variable names which are valid I want you to write two or three in the comment section below if you do that you'll definitely practice so just leave a comment with few variable names and we'll now move on to operators in Python what exactly are operators in Python and why operators in Python are important so what exactly is an operator if I talk about it from mathematical perspective operator is something which acts on something called operant and produces a result for example if I apply plus operator on five and 7 I'll get the sum of 5 and 7 which is 12 if I try to apply minus operator between five and two I'll get three 5 minus 2 is three okay so this is how operators work in Python there are some common operators which I'll be talking about in Python so we firstly have arithmetic operator let's talk about arithmetic operator I'll create a new file 02 uncore and I'll say operators. py so this will simply um keep my different topics separate from each other so what I'll do is I'll try to create a variable name A3 is equal to 45 is it valid yes definitely it is valid because it's not violating any rules it's not starting with a number it doesn't contain any special characters it's starting with a letter and it has a number and a variable name can have a number okay so a is equal to 45 I'll say and I'll say B is equal to 64 okay now I'll try to use some of the operators and I'll try to demonstrate all these operators to you so let's talk about arithmetic operator so we have arithmetic operators arithmatic operators in Python so let me demonstrate all kinds of arithmetic operator to you so I'll print a plus b I'll say a plus b is equal to and I'll use comma let me tell you that you can print multiple values using print statement you can use comma and all the values will keep on printing through single print statement if you use comma so what I'll do is I'll say a plus b is equal to I'll say comma and then I'll do a plus b and in a very similar manner what I'll do is I'll say a minus B and let me do one thing here let me make my a as 75 I just want to make a greater than b there's no logic behind it but since I'm subtracting B from a I just want to keep things simple and I want to make my a greater than b so let's see what the output of this comes and you can see that a plus b is equal 139 A Min - B is equal to 11 so as we can see that A + B 75 + 64 let me make it a bit simple let me make it 7 and 3 so that 7 + 3 will be 10 and 7 - 3 will be 4 that's that's a bit easy right so let me now demonstrate some other operators so we have times and we have divide so multiply and divide okay and the main thing which is multiplying and dividing is the second part this is simple string which I'm printing this is actually performing the calculation and printing the result so you need to make sure that you have star applied to the both sides this is simply merely printing this as is here okay so let me show you so if I say a divided B is equal to this will be printed as is and this will actually perform the calculation so you need to make sure that you are changing this to slash here as well as here okay so you can see that a plus b is 10 a minus B is 4 a * by B which is 7 * 3 is 21 and a divided by B is 2.33 3333 okay I hope you got the point and let's now talk about assignment operators so the value of a was 7even and the B was three we'll have another set of variables for our assignment operators I'll say C is equal to 5 and D is equal to 7 now what I'll do is I'll try to print five and 7even by printing c and d and no surprises I'll get five and seven printed on the screen okay and let me do one more thing what I'll do is I'll create a print statement I'll say demonstrating uh assignment operators in Python okay so whatever is printed above of this line can be ignored because that was the output of arithmetic operators now we'll talk about assignment operators so let me copy this I'm I'm just trying to make this code very structured for you because in case you want to revise in case you are coming back to the noes and trying things out yourself I want you guys to have the code at a single place and I want it to be in a particular order in the same order in which I am demonstrating all these things to you so that will make things easier for you let me now do one more thing let me try to demonstrate arithmetic operators assignment operator sorry what I'll do is I'll say C is equal to five so is equal to is an assignment operator in itself what it does is it takes this right value and it assigns it inside C so what it is doing is this is taking this constant which is five and it is putting it inside the container so just like I'm putting this pen inside the mug I'm not going to do that but I'm just trying to demonstrate I'm just trying to make a point I'm not putting this Spen inside the mug I don't want to do that so five is put inside C okay so we can put five inside C so C is the name of a memory location and five is a constant which I want to put inside that memory location I hope I made it very clear now because we have been talking about variabl since a while now similarly 7 is put inside a container whose name is D so 7 has now been put inside D just like I was about to put but I'll actually not do that I I can put this pen inside this mug I'm not going to do that I use this mug to have my coffee so what I'll now do is I'll say C+ is equal to I'll say C+ is equal to 5 and I'll once again print C and D now how did I copy a line below I told you I use contr D I have my keyboard shortcut set and how did I move the lines I pressed ALT key on my keyboard and I used my arrow keys to move this line so whenever you have cursor somewhere and you press ALT key and then you move your line using up down arrow key you can use that okay you can you can use your up down arrow keys to move the line so C+ is equal to 5 and D+ is equal to I'll give it simple I'll say one I'll say plus equals to 1 and what this will do is this is an increment operator this will add five to c and 1 to D and I'll show you the output here firstly 5 and 7 will be printed on the screen and then 5 + 5 which is 10 and 7 + one which is8 will be printed on the screen so let me run this for you so 5 7 and 10 8 has been printed on the screen so this is how these assignment operators work let's talk about some other assignment operator another assignment operator is minus equals to equals to plus equals to has already been demonstrated by me I want you to practice minus equals to by yourself let's come to compar comparison operators now and let's talk about what comparison operators will do so what I'll do is I'll simply press contr D I'll replicate this and I will say demonstrating um go to the next one comparison operators comparison operators in Python so I'll simply keep the code structured so that you can later come back to this code and you can simply revise peacefully so if a b c d e f so let's say e is equal to 6 and let's say f is equal to 9 and I have given an extra space here which is why python is complaining and let me make a point here you cannot add a tab or a space unnecessarily in Python if you try to do that you'll get synx error if I try to run this file after giving a single space you'll see indentation unexpected indent and we'll talk more about indent in the future but make sure if you're coming from a language like C C++ or Java I know spaces are allowed there but don't try to do that in Python you need to keep the code AS is until we reach the point where we discuss about indentations for Loops y loops and so on so print demonstrating comparison operators in Python e is equal to 6 and F is equal to 9 now if I try to print six uh sorry e triple dou equals to F what what will be printed on this screen so if I say E dou equals to F you might think that e will be assigned to F but no double equals to in Python means comparison and when you are doing a comparison if I ask you a comparison question if I if I ask you uh which car is better Hyundai i20 or Tata elros you are kind of making a comparison if I tell you that Hyundai i20 is just equal to Tata alros they both are equal they both are just equal in features and in comfort and luxury so I'm making a point here I'm making a statement here now this statement can either be true or it can be false in a very similar way I'm saying e is equal to F here it can either be true or it can be false in this case it is false because 6 is not equal to 9 we know that and if we try to run this you can see that it's um false is printed on the screen this particular thing is uh returning false if I say e is greater than f is it true is 6 greater than 9 no it's once again false so another false will be printed on the screen is e lesser than F yeah that's true so true should be printed on the screen I am waiting for the output did I run it yes I did false false true so when I say e is less than F true is printed on the screen because e was actually lesser than F 6 is less than 9 okay we all know that and comparison operators are used for logic building in the program and we are going to use comparison operators in a lot of our projects in almost every project I can say I use comparison operators they are so useful they are so handy and you'll definitely use them a lot of times so let's talk about what kind of comparison operators we have double equals to is a comparison operator which Compares two variables whether they are equal or not greater than is another one which Compares whether a given number is greater than another number or not greater than equal to is another one lesser than is one not equals to is one and I want to you know demonstrate this one if I say is not equals to F this is true is not equals to F and let me do one thing um let me you know keep the E less than F and you'll see two falses and two trues here so false false true true because this is false this is false this is true and once again e is not equal to false f is true because six is not equals to 9 let's try to run this program and you can see that false false true true has been printed on the screen so this is how comparison operators work in action let's come back to the notes and uh let's talk about logical operators now so logical operators are also used to impart logic to a program the difference between these is that the comparison operators are used to compare two identifiers an identifier with a constant or two variables for that matter but in logical operators what we do is we try to add two types of comparisons with each other I'll tell you what I mean by that so I'll close this and I'll say contrl d contrl d and I'll say logical operators in Python let me copy this let me copy this and E6 and fs9 if I say e equal to F and and E is greater than F so and returns true only if both of the conditions are true if I say I a good boy and I like ice cream so if I don't like ice cream the entire statement is false if I say I am a good boy and I like coffee if I'm not a good boy the entire statement is false okay so both of these statements have to be true in case of or either of the two statements can be true and true will be printed on the screen we also have another logical operator which is not and I can pass not of e greater than F I can do not of something to convert false to true and true to false let's see how these work in actions so if I run this code you can see that uh eal to equal to F and E great this returns false this once again returns false because this is false and this is also false so both of these is false hence it is false if either of these is true this will return true I'll show you if I make EAS less than F which is true and if I make e equal toal to F which is false then false or true will actually return true because when we are using or logical operator either of these conditions if either of these conditions is true then true is returned but in case of n if both of the conditions are true then only true is returned let me demonstrate this for you and you can see that true is now printed on the screen in case of not if something is returning false and we are using not on top of that what will happen is it will reverse true to false and false to true so e greater than F was actually false because e was not greater than F you can see e is 6 and F is 9 but but what happened was we are using a not operator so not operator will reverse false to true and true to false and this is what happened and hence we see true printed on the console so this is how operators work in Python now let's talk about the type function and type casting and what does type function return and what type casting mean in Python so type function is used to find the data type of a given variable in Python remember I told you that you don't have to explicitly mention the type of a variable you are creating in python python automatically takes care of that but you can actually get the type of the function the type which python thought would be fine for your variable you can get that type using the type function I'll give you an example I'll make another file let me call it 03 uncore type. py and let me create a variable called a this is a and let me say B is equal to 34 if I print a and if I print B you'll see A and B printed on the screen this is a and 34 will be printed on the screen no surprise is there but if I say type of a let me replicate it one once again if I say type of a and if I say type of B I'm basically asking python I gave you something to be stored inside a what was the data type that you chose to store this did you get the point let me show it to you let me run this code and you'll see so a was a string okay so let me make it B I made it a since a is a string I'm getting this class s Str and since B is an integer I'm getting this class int so if I make B is equal to none or let me create another one and let me once again create another one and you'll see that all these variables will be printed and the types will also be printed we'll do um we will print the types and variables for all these four variables so let me type A BCD and let me run this code and you can see that a was a string B was an integer class for none is none type and then class for this false or true kind of variable is bull so this is how python actually takes care of the variables when you try to assign something inside some bucket okay so this is what type functions do and this is how it works and uh now let's talk about type casting I have given it in the nodes I have mentioned it just because if you are revising after a long time you can simply look into the notes and and you'll have all the things that you need in the nodes itself so a number can be converted into a string and vice versa so you can convert a number to string and you can also convert a string to number if it is possible I'll tell you how so as you can see that um let me get another file for this one just to keep things simple typ casting. tyy so just to keep things simple what I'll do is I'll say a is equal to 56 and B will also be equal to 5 six but since B is inside double quotes B is a string and a is an integer so if I try to print a equals to equals to B this will return false because a is not equals to B so let me run this code for you and you can see false is printed on the screen this is one of the most common bugs in Python that people encounter they try to compare a number which is actually equal to a string but since the one is number and the other one is string python doesn't consider them as equal and people start freaking out why 56 is not equal to 56 it's actually because B is a string and a is a a is an integer it's a number okay so in order to convert this B to a number I can typ cast it to a number I can typ cast it to an integer I can say C is equal to oops I can say C is equal to int of a I'm basically Al saying that I actually want sorry in of B so what I'm basically saying here is I'm saying I need to create a variable C and I want to store B into it but not actually B I want to First convert that b into an integer and then I want to store that into C are you getting the point are you getting what I'm saying here so 56 was a string and and it is a string which can be converted into a number you cannot convert Harry into a number that's not possible 56 is a string which represents a number but it's actually stored as a string and I want to convert this to a number and store it into C so if I print type of a and let me do the same with type of B and type of c b and then we'll say c and a b and c will be printed type of a type of B type of C will be printed let me do that and a = to B and AAL to C will be printed okay so let me do all these things things in order just so that things are organized so firstly what I'll do is I'll use alt and I'll use multic cursor functionality in vs code and a b and c will be printed then whether a is equal to b or a is equal to C or C is equal to B is printed I'll print all these three things so that you can know what kind of variable is equal to which one okay so let's run this code and see what the output of this turns out to be so when you try to print a b and see when you are printing it it seems that a is equal to B is equal to C so dou equals to should return all true but that is not the case a is an integer B is a string and C is again an integer because I'm assigning B into C but not just B I'm changing it first to an integer then I'm assigning it to B so Bal to equals to C is actually false AAL to = to C is true so you can see A = = to B this is false because a is not equals to B A is an integer B is a string AAL to C is true because a is an integer B is an integer and uh sorry a is an integer C is an integer and C is equals to A so this is equals to true this returns true because a double equals to C and I hope you got the point that double equals to is a comparison operator and single equal to is an assignment operator as opposed to what we speak in a daily natural language we use equals to for the equality but here we we don't use equal to as equality uh we use double equal to as equality equal to in Python is um assignment operator and double equal to in Python is comparison operator so a equal to B will return false AAL to C will return true and Bal to C will return false you can see type of a b and c will return int string and int respectively you can see this is an integer once again string and once again this is an integer what will happen if I try to make it 56 Y what will the value of C be in this case the answer is that this program will throw an error because 56 Y is not convertible to integer so if I try to run this program I'll get disappointment I'll get this error I'll get to see value error invalid literal for in with base 10 56 y so python is basically helpless it's saying how do I convert this 56 by to a number I know how to convert 56 to a number but what on Earth do you mean by 56 y so this is what python interpreter is saying it's helpless it fails and it throws a value error invalid literal for in with base 10 I hope this is very clear to you now and um I encourage you to try all these examples in your interpreter uh in your vs code at home we'll move on and we'll discuss about input function now so input function is basically used to take input from the keyboard so if you are a user and you want to take input from the keyboard you can use input function I'll tell you how you can do that okay so let me delete this temp code Runner file so this is something which I which I've not created basically when you select a piece of code and you try to run it a temp code Runner file is created and selected text is pasted into that temp code Runner file I didn't intend it to do that that's why deleted that code Runner file I'll say 05 input. py and I'll demonstrate input function for you if I say a is equal to input and I say enter your name and then if I print your name is a what will the output of this program be let me run this program so the moment I run this program you can see enter your name if I say Harry your name is Harry so this works so let me do one thing let me make it like this enter your name colon SP and then your name is whatever I enter so when I enter Harry what actually happens is let me type Harry what actually happens is a is assigned to whatever has been typed in the form of string the data type of whatever I entered will be a string you need to make sure that whatever you are entering will be a string and if you intend to use that as a number or as an integer you need to typ cast it I'll tell you what I mean by that if I say my name is 56 let us say my name is 56 just assume it for a second 56 your name is 56 if I try to now add three to 56 what will happen will I be getting the desired result uh or let's create a program to add two numbers so let me comment this out and let me say a is equal to input enter first number and this is a classical example of string concatenation and arithmetic calculation in Python so enter first number enter second number as you can see that a will be assigned to whatever I enter as first number and B will be assigned to whatever I entered as second number and if I print the sum is and if I say A+ B you might think that the numbers will be added but they will be not and I'll tell you why they will not be added so I'll use a comma A+ B and let me run this program run code enter first number four and the second number 8 the moment I press enter I'll get 48 and not 12 the reason is that four is a string 8 is a string and when you use a plus character between two strings they are simply concatenated I don't want that I want to add them I want to trade these variables A and B as integers can I do that yes I can do do that but how I'll have to typc cast both of these two numbers two integers let me do that so before adding what I'll do is I'll say sum of int a plus int B so I'm converting a to an integer then I'm converting B to an integer and then I'm performing arithmatic calculation between these two so now if I run this program and if I enter four and 8 do you see that the sum is 12 and when you're giving your prompts you can add an extra space like this just so that your program looks good so enter first number six enter second number two eight is the answer so this is how input works in Python one thing that you need to ensure is that whatever you are using after taking output from the input it will be a string and if you intend to use it as a string well and good but if you intend to use it as a number if you tend to use it as an integer make sure you typ cast it because by default input will return a string so I hope you got the point you can put your prompt inside input and the prompt will be shown to the user and you'll be able to take input from the user so input function allows the user to take input from the keyboard as a string this as a string is very important because this will return a string a is equal to input enter name if a is Harry the user entered Harry if a P 34 user entered 34 and I've used these double Cotes because the output of input is always a string I have explicitly mentioned this in notes because I want you guys to understand this important point it is important to note that the output of input is always a string even if the number is entered the output is string even if a floating Point number is entered the output is a string I hope you got the point and I hope you understood how input how operators and how these variables data types and all these things work so I hope you understood chapter 2 we have come to an end of chapter 2 we'll now go to chapter 2 practice set where we'll discuss and practice questions regarding chapter 2 let's move on to chapter 2 practice set now let's now move forward and open this practice set which I have prepared for you so this is the question set which I've prepared for you we are going to practice all the things that we studied in Chapter 2 and uh let's write a very first first program so a super simple question has popped up write a Python program to add two numbers so what I'm going to be doing is I'll open vs code here in this folder and I'll say 06 uncore and I'll say practice one okay practice 01p so basically this is uh a question that I'm solving from practice set which is why I have named it practice 01p so it'll be easy for you to find out which question solution is where okay so write a program to to add two numbers so I'll say the first number is a and I'll say enter the first number and then I'll say B is equal to input enter the second number and then I'll say print the sum of these two numbers is and I'll say A+ b super simple isn't it this is wrong and I want you guys to comment in the comment section below why this is wrong because I have discussed it a lot of times and I want you guys to at least make out now what is wrong with this program so if you have pointed out correctly the problem is that we have not typ casted the input into an integer when we are adding two numbers we want to add them in the form of integers not in the form of string so if I run this program let me save this program and run it for you you can see enter the first number let us say four 7 is 4 + 747 no we know that it's wrong what is wrong with the program we haven't typ casted the inputs so we'll say end and I'll press end on my keyboard to make these Arrow go towards the right of the respective lines and then once again a CL closing bracket let me controls to save and let me run it again and let me punch in the same inputs 47 and yes this is correct now 4 + 7 is 11 I hope you understood what was wrong initially when I didn't use this int when I didn't typ cast it my output of input into an integer okay so by default input will always will always return a string even if you punch in a number it will return return a string you will have to convert that string to a number now once again let me tell you something if you enter something which is not a number or rather I should say which is not convertible to number you'll get an error let us say if I enter this I'll get an error so this is a runtime error which is thrown and basically bython interpreter is telling me that hey this is not valid okay this is not something which is allowed how do I convert this particular thing entered by you into a number so this is something python interpreter is telling you so it throws an error it fails uh it tried to recover it but it couldn't it said DF 534 cannot be converted to any number and hence the error okay I hope you understood how we solve this problem coming back to our practice set question number two write a Python program to find remainder when a number is divided by two so whenever you are dividing a number by two what is the remainder so this is a very interesting problem and let me tell you that we have have an operator in Python for the same and it is an arthamatic operator so let me create a file here I'll name it 07 underscore and it's going to be practice 2.by so py is the python file extension uh in case you don't know so let me start writing the solution to this problem so I need to find out the remainder when a number is divided by two so in order to do that first I need to grab the number I can either say in int input I can say int off input off and I can say enter the number and I'm basically giving user an option to enter that number okay now what I'll do is I'll say remainder let me say print remainder when the number is divided by 2 is and the remainder is let me tell you it's a single line it's an operator in Python which returns this and it's called modulus operator in case you don't know it so it's an arithmetic operator and you can simply say uh number person two so if you say number person two not dollar it's number person two and if you save it you can see that remainder when number is divided by two is you'll get it okay so let me run this let me punch in 76 and when 76 is divided by two we all know that the remainder is zero because 76 is divisible by two okay okay so let me try some other number which is not divisible by two let me say three the remainder is one and I can do this with any number I can even say when some number is divided by three what is the remainder I can find it out by using this modulus operator so our question said that find the remainder when a number is divided by two and we did it so this is how you find out the remainder when a number is divided by some given number so modulus is the operator modulus is the guy you need to go for so let's move on to question number three now and let me create another file for that I know I'm creating a lot of files but this will come in handy when you are um when you are coming back to the notes and referring for the solutions it's going to be very very helpful for you um we we'll end up with a lot of files but again this will be helpful this will keep all these files in an organized way so question number three says check the type of variable assigned using input function so basically let me tell you what this question wants you to do whenever you are using input what is the type of the variable that is returned by input this is this is the meaning of the question it seems a bit fake but let me tell you the meaning of this question so what I'll do is I'll say a is equal to input and let me say enter something it can be anything it can be whatever you want so far what we were doing is we were saying enter first number second number enter this number that number so we were punching in just the numbers but here you can read whatever you want and once you do that what I'll do is I'll say the type of a is and then I'll say type of a so type is the function that we need to use and this has to be string if what I told you is correct so let me type in something if I'm typing in some number it is class string if I'm typing in some decimal number the type is once again string and if I'm typing some sort of let me type in something Harry is a good boy and you can see the class is string okay so I hope you are very very clear about what input is returning input Returns the characters entered by the user in the form of string okay coming back to question number four use comparison operators to find out whether a given variable a is greater than b or not so there is a variable a there is a variable B the values are 34 and 80 and you need to use comparison operator to find whether a given variable a is greater than b or not let us say that you don't know which number is greater than the other number which is given to you and now you want to use comparison operators in Python so let me create another file for you I know I'm creating a lot of files just for for organizing the code correctly so this is question number four so practice 04 and I'm I'll be using comparison operators for comparing these numbers so a is 34 and B is 80 so I'll say B is equal to 880 and then I'll say a is greater than b is so it can be true or false so I'll say a is greater than B is a greater than b no it is not a is greater than b is false so if it is false then a is not greater than b if it is true then a is greater than b so if I make a greater than b I'll find that this is is returning true let me try this out let me run this piece of code for you at this moment a is greater than b is returning false but once I change this to 346 this will change to true as you can see this has been changed to true and I don't need an space here and U one thing that you might have noticed is that whenever you are typing something inside print and you're typing another argument which is comma separated argument the second argument is Auto appended with a space what I mean by that is when we are printing this and this using print statement and using this comma then a is greater than b is colon B don't have a space here but still the space will be printed let me show you once again a is greater than b is true colon I didn't type the space this space has automatically been added by the print statement so if you use comma separated values inside print statement all those values will be spaced with this character a white space will automatically be placed between those so I hope this is clear and you are able to uh follow up here uh now let's move to question number five which is write a Python program to find average of two numbers entered by the user so finding average of two numbers is pretty straightforward just add those numbers and divide them by two but I want you guys to make this program so I want you to pick your keyboard up and start typing the code this is very very simple I'll skip this question and I'll move on to question number six which says write a Python program to calculate square of a number entered by the user so basically you need to take a number from the user and then you have to multiply that number with the same number using star operator let me show it to you in action so I'll create another file 10or practice10 py and I'll say a is equal to int input enter the number and I'll say print the square of this number is and I'll say a star a this was super simple so if you enter 9 the square of 9 is 81 so let me do one more thing let me add a colon and a space here let me run this code enter the number 7 7 * 7 is 49 if you do the same with 11 you'll get 121 let me show you so this is how you find out square of a number using python fairly simple and straightforward I hope you enjoyed this practice R make sure to download the notes from the description and make sure to keep a print out of all these notes and source code not source code just the notes source code can live in your computer but notes are something you need to take out of because it's really very convenient when you have all these notes handy but if you are a PDF person you can even keep the PDF of all these notes let's move on to chapter 3 now and dive more into the awesomeness of python we'll now get started with a new chapter which is string string is basically a data type in Python and string represents a sequence of characters enclosed in quotes now we talked about what an integer is we talked about what a floating Point number is now we are going to deep dive into what strings are what are the methods that we can use with strings how do we slice a string and we are doing all this just because we are going to use string a lot in our python Journey so what I'm going to be doing now is I will create a program called 01 string. py and what I'll do is I'll write some code inside this program so I'll create a sample variable name and I'll put Harry inside this so when I'm doing this I'm essentially telling python interpreter hey python interpreter this is a string this is a sequence of characters please put the sequence of character inside name name is my variable I want h a r r y to be stored inside this variable so now whenever I say name python knows what I'm talking about I'm talking about this sequence of characters I'm talking about the memory location where the sequence of characters uh is stored okay so what I'll do is I'll simply print this and I'll simply once again print type of name we already did this in previous chapter and no prizes for guessing Harry and Str Str will be printed okay so Harry is printed for name and type of name prints St Str because this is a variable of typ string okay so so far this much is clear to all of you this is something I will expect from you at this point let's create another the variable name two and let me store JN into this variable if I say name two and if I store JN in this variable I'll see John and class s Str but this time instead of using double codes I'll be using single codes and I'll simply run this code and you can see Harry class s Str Chan class s Str has been printed on the output screen now why does python offer these two types of codes and why not just a single code so let let me explain this to you let us say you want to add a single code inside somebody's name for example Adam dangelo so this is the name of Kora founder Adam dangelo if I've spelled it correct so there is a single quote in the name and since there is a single quote in the name I can use double quotes to enclose this name and store it inside this variable so if I try to run this program I can successfully run it Adam dangelo John class St Str okay what will happen if I don't use double code what will happen if I use a single code if I use single code python interpreter will get confused as to where this particular string is ending it will think that I'm starting the string here and I'm ending the string here and this is some crap which I've written here and I don't want to confuse my python interpretor so what I'll do is when I know that my string will contain a single code I'll enclose it with double Cotes if I know that my string will contain double code let me add a double code here I'll enclose it with single quotes So if you know that your string is going to contain double quotes use single quotes and if you know that your string is going to contain single quotes enclose them with double quotes Okay so this is basically why we have single quotes and double quotes both of these in Python so let me run this code and you can see uh am I making some mistake no let me save it let me try to run it once again and you can see Adam dangelo class s Str John class s Str let's not talk about another type of code that we have in Python which is a triple code and we have already used triple code if you remember we have used it while we were writing the Twinkle Twinkle Little Star poem um I hope you enjoyed that poem I'm going to type that poem yet again just to remind you what we did in our previous to previous to previous chapter if I'm not wrong um to twinkle twinkle little star how I wonder what you are so what I'll do is I'll simply copy the lyrics from this poem let me copy this lyrics Let Me paste it here and let me once again enclose it inside triple codes and if I do the same thing with name three now you will see that name one name two and name three all these three strings will be printed along with their respective types which is Str Str so when I'm using double codes type typ is St Str when I'm using single codes type is s Str when I'm using triple codes type is once again s Str except the fact that now I can use single Cotes double Cotes as well as new line characters inside my string so this is very handy when you have single Cotes let me put a single code inside uh this particular string and let me put a double quote as well and if I run this program I'll get no syntax error whatsoever and you can see my single code and double quot all of these things will be visible so let me save this program before running don't forget to save the program before running and you can see I have my single code here and I have my double code here and I can successfully print my string using print statement which contains single quote and double quote so my string contains a single code my string contains a double code my string contains a bunch of new line characters still I able to print that string to the console using print statement so I hope you understood the use of three types of codes we have a single code we have a double code and we also have a triple quote so the use is use single quotes when you have double quotes in your strings use a double quote when you have single quotes in your strings and use triple quotes when you have a lot of new line character single quotes and double quotes in your string so I hope this information will be very useful I have compressed all the information which I gave you in the form of these notes so make sure you download your copy of notes from the description I'll provide the link make sure you have these set of notes and um you can download these notes in a single click from the description let's now talk about string slicing and why would you use string slicing so a string in Python can be sliced for getting a part of the string so let us say um name is equal to Harry is a string and I just want to get first two characters from the string how do I get the first two characters from the string so if you want to get first two characters or say first three characters or two characters starting from the third character if you want to do operations like this what you can do is you can use string slicing let me show you slicing in action using my visual studio code so I'll say 02 uncore slicing. py let me delete the stamp code Runner file I don't want to use that I'll say name is equal to Harry okay so name is equal to Harry is a string and I want to get first two characters of this string so let me explain you how string slicing Works in Python so h a r r y is the sequence of characters which this particular variable holds listen to me very carefully this is very important now if I talk about H this is marked as zero so index in Python starts from zero if you're counting something in your regular life you count from 1 2 3 4 5 6 but if you want to do the same thing in Python and and in some other languages like Java C and C++ the counting starts from zero so you count from zero instead of counting from one so you say this is index zero this is index one then index two index three and index 4 so 0er 1 2 3 and four so we have 0 1 2 3 4 in total five indexes and now I can use string slicing to print a part of string first let me print the entire string if I print the entire string you can see Harry has been printed now what I'll do is I'll simply print I'll say name then I'll use a square bracket this is important just look at the syntax how I'm writing these square brackets I'll say zero I'm basically saying I just need index zero out of all the characters in this string so out of h a r r y I want to get the character which is present at index zero okay I hope you got the point let me run this code and let me save this file I forgot to save the file before running the code let me run this code and you can see when I'm saying print name Harry has been printed and for this line I get this output which is just a single H isn't it interesting you can get any character of your choice from the string using print name square bracket and the name of the index so if I were to write one I'll get a if I were to write um say three I'll get 0 1 2 3 I'll get R if I if I write four I'll get y so let me run it for four I'll get Y what will happen if I try to run it for five I know this is not valid but still if I try to run it for five what will happen this will give me an error Pon interpreter will tell me that this is an index error index out of range so python interpretor is basically telling me that index starts from zero so this is zero this is one this is two this is three this is four I don't know what five is so go and find out what five is I don't know don't ask me so this is basically python interor telling you don't ask me what index 5 is I don't know you are asking me the wrong question this is basically what python interpreter is telling you when you are saying print name five so we'll make sure that we are in the range um our index is not out of range and we'll make sure that a program doesn't throw this kind of error because once a program throws an error it will terminate and it is a bad user experience if your program terminates out of the blue you don't want that you don't want your program to terminate out of the blue you want a good user experience you want to handle all the exceptions you want to make sure that whatever you are typing in the code is valid and will not throw an error okay so with that said we'll move forward and we'll talk about Advanced slicing so a string in Python can be sliced for getting a part of the string as we saw we got a single character out of the string as you can see I have drawn this string h a r r y the length of this string is five if you uh find out the number of characters in The String they are five but we start marking 0 1 2 3 4 we start the index from zero now since the length of this string is five we can start counting from reverse and we can write -1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5 so either you can call these 1 0 1 2 3 4 or you can start counting from backwards and come -1 -2 - 3 -4 and - 5 so the index in a string starts from 0 to length minus one so if the length of the string is five you'll have 0 1 1 2 3 and four as indexes and in order to slice a string we use the following synex so one way of getting a single character from the string was writing name writing the name of the variable and then using these square brackets and typing the uh index of the string which you want now since I want 0 1 2 3 4 since I want this character I'll write index of this character which is four uh starting from zero this particular character comes at Fourth index now if you want to get a part of the string say first two characters or first three characters you can always use the syntax where in what you do is you say the name of the variable which is name and you can use these square brackets and instead of just writing an index inside the square brackets what you can do is you can mention the starting index and the ending index so I can say 0 to three and this will print all the indices except three and including zero so what it will do is it will count from zero 1 and two three is not included so this particular index is not included first index is included last index is not included so I hope you got the point um you can say sl0 to3 it will WR you h a r if your variable um contains h a r r y which is my name characters from 0 to 3 characters from 1 to 3 if you type 1 colon 3 including one and excluding three okay this is important this is very important so if I show you name four um let me not say four let me say one to two or 1 to 4 so this will give me character at index one character at index 2 character at index 3 but not character at index 4 so I'll get three characters which are 1 2 and three so I'll get a r r let's see if I get a r r after running this let me run this code and yes I indeed get ARR so this is how advanced string slicing works you mentioned the first index you mention the last index and you get the result now there is a concept of negative indices which you might use I already told you that you can mark your negative indices starting from one from the back side of the string and you can come all the way to the beginning so if I were to Mark negative indices in this particular variable what I'll do is I'll say minus one -2 - 3 -4 and -5 so what I'll now do is I will tell you about negative indices negative indices can also be used as shown in the figure above I already demonstrated it here and minus one corresponds to the length minus one index and minus 2 to length minus 2 index and so on so minus1 is the last uh character of the string and we can always use negative indices in place of four so you can either write four or you can write minus one in this case you can either write two or you can write minus 3 in this case so for a different string the counting will be different make sure do not try to learn these indices by heart because you might have just three characters in your string and then starting from the end if you start marking your string from min-1 -2 - 3 -4 your second character might not be minus 4 so let us say you have a variable which is following so you have a string which as f o l l o w i n g so it basically has 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 nine characters if I want to mark this particular string with negative indexes what I'll do is I'll mark G as minus one n as minus 2 then - 3 - 4 - 5 then L will be - 6 this L will be - 7 - 8 - 99 so I hope you got the point of negative indexes they are not used as much as posit positive indices but again you might encounter them in some source code and you might want to learn about it which is the reason I mentioned them in these notes so let's talk about slicing with skip value what is a skip value we can provide a skip value as a part of our slice like this so if you have a word amazing you can use 1 to six and you can say I want to take every second character so this is basically taking every second character from the string let us see if we can create another file and demonstrate this thing so skip underscore value so I'll say skip underscore value. py I'll say uh my St Str which is the name of the variable I'll say this or let me say a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v WX y z okay so this is ABCD and let me save it let me now try to uh print uh my S Str let me print 226 and let's let's try to predict output of this so my Str Str 226 will include index 2 but exclude index 6 so it will go all the way from 2 to 5 so 0 1 2 3 4 5 so this should be the output c d EF so I'm expecting cdef to be the output of this program and indeed I am true I'm right cdef will be the output of this program okay so I hope you got the point of slicing we can even use negative slices you can try it with negative slices but I'll now demonstrate skip value so I'll say uh let's say I want to get one to 9 with a skip value of two let's try skip value of one what does Skip value of one means skip value of one means I want to skip no characters Okay so what I'll do is I'll simply run this code and what you will see is you'll see this particular line so u 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 so 9 is not included index 9 is not included now if I write two here it will take every second character so if I write one here it will take every first character means it will take all the characters if I write two here it will take every second character so the output which I'm expecting now is B d f and H how do I know this the output will be B DF and H I know this because I'm starting from the index one and I'm skipping one character I'm skipping one character I'm saying start from B and then go all the way to D then go to F then go to H keep skipping one character so b d f and H let's try to run it and you can see B dfh has been displayed so B dfh has been printed to the console what if I add skip value of three what will be the output in that case as you can see the output in that case is be and how do I know it is b e and H uh let me do one more thing let me try skip value of one that is no skip value and let me see the string if I'm not using any skip value so this is a string which is printed by um as a result of this line without any skip value so B CDE e f g h i is the output of this particular line if I use skip value of three and basically saying skip two characters so B will be printed two characters will be skipped e will be printed two characters will be skipped H will be printed two characters cannot be skipped so that's the end of the output so I hope how skip value Works seems very intuitive to you and you don't have any confusions regarding the skip value part so this is how skip value works I have shown an example in the notes as well in case you forget about Skip value you can always come back to notes turn few pages and you'll have everything at your disposal okay so there are some other string slicing techniques you can skip this zero if you want to write zero you can skip it and that simply means that you want a zero here if you want to go all the way towards the end of the string you can simply skip the second index which we were using here while slicing so you can do all these kind of things but I suggest you to use the uh first index as well as the last index if you keep both of these things are pretty intuitive and simple for the person who is reading your code so this will print amazing this will also print amazing and I hope now you are pretty comfortable with um how these kind of things are working let's come back to the string functions and let's talk about string functions why string functions are important and why would you want to use string functions now string is something which is used a lot in our Python program string is something which which you are going to use a lot if you want to start your journey as a python programmer some of the mostly used functions to perform operations on or manipulate strings are I'm now discussing some of the methods which can be used to manipulate strings so let's do one thing let's create a separate file to do all these things I'll say 04 uncore uh string underscore functions. py okay so I'll say string is equal to or let me simply copy this my St Str I'll use this string and I'll simply say print length of this my S strr what is the length of this my St strr I haven't counted it I know it is 26 but let's see what python has to say so if I run this code the number of characters in English alphabet is 26 uh which is how I know this but you can count it you can count it don't believe python don't believe me just count it and get some satisfaction so this is a function which is used to print the length of a given string how many characters are present in a given string so length will simply Len will simply print the length of the string coming back to the notes I've written it here this functions the length of the string so Len of har is five in this case we have 26 characters which is why 26 is being printed on the screen okay so coming back to the next important method of string ends with this simply returns whether particular string end ends with a given set of characters or not so Harry ends with RR y you all know that so this function will return true so this function tells whether the variable strings ends with is um ends with the string r y or not so whether a given variable so string is a variable whether this string ends with r y or not let me demonstrate it for my example because things might go messy if you don't understand them well so my St str. NS with does it end with RR y or eer no it doesn't so this should print false as you can see this has printed false on the console 26 false 26 for Len my St strr and false for this particular line now if I replace this with XY Z and if I use contr S to save and if I now try to run the program see the magic this returns true because indeed my string now ends with XY Z so since my string ends with XY Z ends with function returns true now so I'm asking my python interpreter hey python interpreter does this string ends with XY Z my python interpreter is saying wait let me check let me match the last three characters oh yes your string ends with XY Z so it returns true okay so this is programmatically used to detect whether your string ends with a particular set of characters or not okay I hope this is very intuitive and I hope you understood ends with similarly we have starts with so you can say starts with and does it starts with XY Z no it doesn't starts with XYZ it starts with ABC so this should return false let me see this returns false if I replace it with um I'm simply keeping the code which I've written for you because you might want to refer to this file and get the code which we have written throughout the video I don't want to overwrite any code so if I write ABC and if I use this starts with function this will return true because indeed this string starts with ABC let me run it for you and yes your string ends with XY Z and yes your string starts with ABC so it starts with ABC it also starts with ABC D because first four characters of the string are ABCD so it will again return true so I hope you got the point I hope you understood how starts with and ends with functions work so coming back to the notes we have another function called count so this function will count the total number of occurrences of any character in your string so if I say my string. count so if I say uh print my string. count and if I count the occurrences of character a in the string if I want to get the occur es of this particular substring in my string there is only one a in my string so this should return one as you can see this is returning one if I add a bunch of A's To the End definitely it is going to return four now because I have added three more A's so you can even get the occurrence of ab in the string and there is only one AB which is why one is printed but if I add another AB towards the end you can see that there are two ABS now this is first AB this is second AB so there are two ABS in the string now I hope this is very clear and you can also check that starts with and ends with all these functions are updating with the correct value since the string no longer ends with XY Z now I'm getting false here and since the string starts with ABCD even now this is printing true so this is how all these functions work so we have seen Len ends with starts with we now look into capitalize which is an amazing function this simply capitalizes the first character of a given string so capitalize in English means you want to make first character of Any Given word as capital so let me write uh line for you make sure I can always overwrite my string I can always say my name is Harry okay and if I run this code uh oops I want to use this for function my St Str do capitalize let me run this code for you and my name is Harry has been printed but with a minor change the slight change which I see is that m in my string is small M and M in this string is capital M so it will basically capitalize the string it will see uh the first character and it will change it to uppercase what if my first character is already uppercase it will not do anything it will simply print the same thing it will check whether my string is already capitalized or not if it's already capitalized it will not do anything else with my string so if you have small M here you can simply you know you can simply capitalize your string and get this m character changeed to uppercase M coming back to the nodes we have another function called find this will basically find a word and Returns the index of first occurrence of the word in the string let me explain what this means so inside my name is Harry I have Harry but at what index at which index is this Harry word present in my string this is something which is returned by find so I can say find find Harry in this string or let me keep it simple find name in the string if I try to run this code you can see from starting from index 3 I'll have name let me see if it is true 0 1 2 3 yes starting from three I have name which is true uh if I have another name at the end will it return me this particular index which is three or will it return me index of this particular character the answer is it will return me three because this function returns index of first occurrence of the string so my S str. find name will return three once again because this function returns first occurrence of the word in the string so looking at our next function which is replace you can always replace a given word with another word in the string so this function replaces the old word with a new word in the entire string let me demonstrate it for you let us say I want to change name to something else let us say I want to uh change name to date okay so what I'll do is I'll simply say print and I'll say my S R do replace and I'll say I want to replace name and I want to replace name with some other string let me say um let me say underscore underscore or let me say my date is date so if I run this particular code my date is Harry date so my name is Harry name has been changed to my date is hary date so this doesn't make any sense but I hope this function and these functions all together make sense to you now so I hope you got how Len Works how starts with Works how ends with Works how count Works how capitalize Works how find Works how replace works so these are the set of functions which are which you are going to use a lot in your python Journey believe me so keep your notes handy and you'll definitely come back to this page and this page will prove very very useful to you now before we wrap this chapter up let's talk about escape sequence characters so escape sequence characters are sequence of characters which have a backs slash now what does it mean Escape sequent characters comprises of more than one characters we have a backslash and we have another character um but but there's a difference it represents a single character so we are typing more than one character but despite that it is representing A Single Character how is it possible let's let's let's check this out let's try to understand how this is possible so I am typing escape sequences. py and I'll say my name is equal to I'll say my name is Harry okay and now what I'll do is I'll simply print this particular thing my name and no price is for guessing my name is Harry will be printed on the screen okay so my name is Harry has been printed on the screen what if I want to print my name and then a new line character then is Harry and a new line character and let us say I want to have a bunch of new line characters in my string how do I manage that I can do that using scape sequence characters I can simply say back sln and this will add a new line character here so back SL and is an escape sequence character used to add new lines in my string so I can always run this program and I can see my name is Harry in a separate line because back sln is a line break character it's a new line character I know I have typed more than one characters but it is a single character which is a new line character and similar to back sln we have some other characters like back SLT is one this is for tab and uh let me done this code for you you can see my name is and there is a big tab here so a tab is printed and uh a new line is also printed so escape sequence characters are used to produce this kind of effects in your strings so back selection is new line back SLT is tab back SL single code is a single code and if you want to have just backs SL printed in your uh string you can simply use double backs slash so if I use a single code inside a single CED string it will not work or if I try to use double code inside a double CED string it will not work so what I'll use is I will use a back slash double quote which is a double quote character so these two characters is a part of an escape sequence character which is a double code let me run this program for you I'll save it and I'll run it and you can see the double code is printed if I don't use this backs slash I'll get syntax error let me show you so if I don't use this backs slash python interpreter will get confused it will it will think that I'm trying to I'm trying to start this string here and I'm trying to end it here and this is something which has been entered by mistake so python will get confused if I don't use this back slash double code so this was about escape sequence characters we have escape sequence back slash we have Escape sequenced uh single code we have tab new line we already talked about new line uh I hope you now understood what escape sequence characters are you can go to the internet and you can search for other escape sequence characters which can be used in your python programs I hope this chapter was very easy to understand for you and you understood every bit of uh whatever has been taught in this chapter we are now going to go to a chapter 3 practice set where we'll practice a lot of questions regarding strings string functions escape sequence characters so let's move on to chapter 3 practice it now let's move on to chapter 3 practice set now so I'll open this chapter 3 practice set PDF which I've created for you and this contains a few questions on strings and we are going to solve all these questions so let's get started with the first question and before that I'll be opening my visual studio code uh on this folder so this is the folder where I've created uh all the files for this chapter let me close all these files and let me create another file uh 06 uncore uh practice one. py so I'm going to solve question number one here let me open the PDF and see what question number one says it says write a Python program to display a user entered name followed by good afternoon using input function so what you have to do is you have to enter a name and you will have to make your program say good afternoon Harry or good afternoon samisha good afternoon rtia good afternoon John good afternoon J whatever the number is whatever the name is typed okay so let's code this and this is fairly straightforward I know this is fairly straightforward so all you have to do is you have to say name is equal to and you have to say input enter your name and now just say print and type good afternoon and then use string concatenation you can use plus to concatenate two strings and then name so good afternoon and the name you can either do this or you can use a comma if you use a comma you are basically giving another argument to the print function you are saying print good afternoon and then print name both of the approaches are fine let's try this program out I'll run the code and as you can see that I'm being asked to enter my name I'll say Harry and good afternoon Harry is the output of the program fairly straightforward isn't it so this is how you solve this question let's move on to the next question write a program to fill in a letter template given below with name and date and this is kind of tricky I would say but uh not very difficult if you have already followed chapter 3 nicely thoroughly and you have listened to each and everything that I talked about so in order to solve this question let me create another file for you 07 uncore and I'll make it practice 2. py and and let me type this template for you dear name you are selected and date so you have to fill this letter template with name and date okay so let me take the name and date from the user I'll say enter the name and then I'll say uh date is equal to input enter the date and then I'll say template is equal to and I'll use triple codes do you know why I use triple codes here because I'm going to use new lines inside the string and in order to use new lines as is in the string I need to use triple codes okay so I'll say dear name you are selected and then there is some date okay so de name you are selected you are selected is a new line and then I have to punch in the date here and let me check the template template is uh capital name and capital date and I have these pipe characters as well so I have to add three more pipe characters like this I'm using alt click to use multifunction multi cursor functionality in vs code so let me save this now so I'll replace this thing with the name and this thing with the date in order to do that what I'll do is I'll print template. replace I'll say replace this particular thing this particular thing with the name with the actual name which has been entered by the user I'll replace this with name and then once again I'll chain it up with replace once again replace the date with the actual date and if you're confused how this is working let me run this program for you first and then I'll explain how this is working so let me see if it works I'll say Harry and enter the date I'll say 7 October dear hary you are selected 7 October okay so this is how it works let me explain how this chaining of replace works so template is a string okay and I'm generating a new string by replacing name in the template this particular string in the template with the actual name variable so this particular thing the selected text will return a string I can use this string once again and apply replace function on this string to replace this particular date Place holder with the actual date so template was a string so I can use replace with it and once again this particular thing was a string so I can again replace uh another set of characters with another string so I hope you now got how this works you can keep on changing dot replace dot replace and this will chain up all the calls of replace which you have placed so I hope this this is clear and you understood how this works let's now move on to the next question and let's try to understand how to detect double spaces in a string so given a string detect double spaces inside those strings how do you do that let me create another file for you I'll say 08 uncore practice 3py and now what I'll do is I'll say my St is equal to and I'll say this is me and I'll say and I am a good boy okay so I have to detect whether this contains double double spaces or not so in order to do that I'll say print I'll say my SDR dot find and I'll detect double spaces so one two now if I try to find double spaces inside the string I should get the index so as you can see I'm getting index 10 which means double spaces are present inside the string what if anything is not present inside the string and you try to apply fine for example Harry is not present in this string and if I try to find Harry what will I get I'll get minus one let me show it to you I'll get minus1 and minus1 means that this particular string is not present in this string okay so my St Str doesn't contain Harry so this is how you can use f find to find out whether a given string is present in another string or not so this is how this program or rather this question will be solved let's move on to question number four which is once again a very easy problem replace the double spaces from problem three with single spaces and in order to do this I'll create another file practice for. py and let me do one thing I'll copy this entire program number eight to program number nine because this is very very similar and what I'll do is I'll replace these double spaces with something else and what was that something else um we have to replace it with single spaces so let me replace this with single space so I'll say replace these double spaces with just a single space and let me remove this and if I run this program yes indeed my double spaces are replaced with single spaces but I do have triple spaces here I'll get rid of of triple spaces I don't want triple spaces so I just have to replace double spaces with a single space and if I run this program now you can see that I no longer have any double spaces inside my uh output string so this is how you solve this problem very very simple problem if you understand how strings work if you understand how string functions work um so write a program to format the following letter using escape sequence characters so you have a given letter and you'll have to use escape sequence characters to format this so let me tell you what it means dear Harry this python course is nice thanks let me create another file for this one 10 uncore and I'll say practice 5. py and the letter is the letter is dear Harry this python course is helpful is there anything else no is nice is nice thanks okay so what I'll do is I'll say back sln here and I'll say back sln here so these are two escape sequence characters which I added to the parent string and let me see how this looks after I print this letter so once I print this letter you can see that this looks like this but won't it be nice if I have a tab here just before this so if I say back SLT just before this python course is nice this will look something like this so this is a fairly small letter which is why this is not looking very good but if you have a lot of characters inside your letter then definitely your letter will look good with this tab I hope I'm able to explain how sequence characters work and I hope you are able to solve all these five questions by yourself if you are not able to solve these five questions by yourself it's totally fine I've added these practice sets for your practice practice you don't have to know all these five questions because sometimes I'm delivering some Concepts using the using these questions in the practice set so I hope you are very very happy with uh how strings work how string functions work and you feel confident in your python Journey now so let's move on to chapter 4 now where we'll move ahead and talk about some more concepts of python let's move on to chapter 4 now so now that we have some understanding of basic data types let's now talk about list and Tes and let me open this chapter 4 PDF for you so that you can look into what I have written in the notes and that will make your life a whole lot easier when you're trying to learn about list and doues because if you are following the nodes then you have everything at one place and you just have the things that you need to recall at single place so it's not a 500,000 page book uh it is just a curated helpful material so let's talk about what python list is so so we have talked about strings we have talked about numbers they can be integer floats uh we have talked about strings we have also talked about a lot of other Concepts in Python now we going to talk about list how many times do you create list in your real life you go to the grocery shop you go to buy apples you go to buy banana you go to buy cereals you go to buy a lot of things and when you're going to the market to buy certain things what you do is you curate the list of all uh items you need to buy buy from the market before going to the market just in case you forget something you have the list handy in the same way if you are programming something in Python you can create a collection of items and you can store it in a single container and list is that container let me explain it once again and let me read out what I've written in the notes so that you can have some better understanding of the same so python list are containers to store a set of values of any data type so you can store any data type in the list you have no restrictions no restrictions like you can only store strings or you can only store numbers in a list you can store whatever you want you can even store a list inside list I repeat you can even store a list inside of list so this is a beauty of python so if I am creating a list called friends I can say apple I can say Akash I can add Rohan I can then add seven which is an integer I can add false which is a Boolean so different set of data types inside a single list let's see how we can do the same uh using visual studio code let me open this folder in Visual Studio code and let me create a program 01 list. py so here I'm going to demonstrate the basic idea of list in Python so let us say I have a number which is 12 and I have a string which is this is a string a very basic string and let me have a Boolean as well I'll store fals inside this Boolean in now what I'll do is I'll say my list is equal to I'll use these square brackets now these square brackets are used to create a list whenever you see these square brackets and a set of items separated by comma inside these square brackets what you mean is you are creating a list okay so whenever you see this the programmer intends to create a list okay so let me add a b and see inside this list and let me keep it very basic to start with and just print this list let let's print this list and see what is there inside this list so let me run this code and you can see 12 this is a string false on your screen so these are the three items which are there inside the list and we have this data type which is list so let's try to run type function so remember we use type function to find out which data type a particular variable is let's do the same with list and see what it splits out so so when I say print type my list what actually is going to print is the class this my list belongs to let's see which class this belongs to let me run this code this belongs to class list as you can see we have class list printed on this console so my list is in itself a data type which is a list and list is a collection of items which can be a Boolean it can be a string it can be a number it can be a floating Point number let me add few more to demonstrate I I can I can use variable names or I can use the actual values anything works okay so this is the basic idea of list now let let's talk about slicing in list or indexing as they call it a list can be indexed just like a string we looked into Strings and we saw how strings can be indexed we can use the index 0 1 2 to refer to a specific number or any sort of variable inside the list uh we can use the same thing in list as we used it in string let me tell you how we can do that uh consider this list L1 so list can be indexed just like a string there's no other concept it's just simple indexing which we use in strings so L1 is a list and what I'm saying is I'm saying it contains 79 and Harry now if I say L1 and zero inside the square bracket I'm talking about the seven remember indexing starts from zero do not count from one you might have seen a lot of programming memes where they say uh counting starts from zero but in actual life counting starts from one we all know that do not count from zero in your real life just just do the same and you cing in Python so L10 will give you 7 l11 will give you 9 l170 will give you error why will l170 give you an error because the index 0 1 and two are the only valid indices for this list okay you cannot use 70 or 700 or 200 for that matter because this list is just not that large okay so if you say L1 0 to 2 this will give you the value 0o which is 7 and then it will give you the value one but two will be excluded so the First Slice is included while the last one is not included we have seen this in strings and the same applies for list as well okay so let me do one thing now let me add another file and why I'm creating so many files I'm creating these files for you so that you can um you can come back to these files you can revise the specific concept so slicing is there in this file so if you were to find out how slicing is done in Python you can simply come back to this list and you will know how slicing is done in Python let me let me write the same uh same string which is 79 and Harry let let's write 79 and then I'll say Harry let me print L10 let me print L1 first of all let me see what I get so if I run this code it says okay so I've selected H and um then F the Run command do not select anything and click here just click somewhere you don't have to select anything because if you select something code Runner will execute that particular code you don't want that you want the entire file to be executed do not mistakenly select like I did okay so let's run this code and you can see 79 Harry printed on the console if I change it to L10 you'll see that only seven will be printed okay so s is printed if I say l11 9 will be printed let's check it yes 9 is printed if I use two and save it you'll see Harry will be printed yes Harry is printed so this is how indexing Works in list it's exactly the same thing we saw in strings but once again I just wanted to demonstrate you so if I say 0 to two this will include index number zero index number one but not two two will not be included okay make sure that you kind of somehow remember this that zero will be included two will not be included so L1 0 to2 will give you 0er and one not two okay so you are going to get seven and nine inside a list so this entire thing is going to return a list remember when we were slicing strings what was the end value the end value was a string you were getting a string when you were slicing a string so slice of a string is string slice of a bread is bread slice of a list is a list so you can remember it like this okay I hope I'm able to make things easier for you so print L1 0 to2 will give you 7 and 9 inside a list okay so let me run this program for you and you can see seven and nine inside a list is printed what if I use three what if I say L10 to 3 L1 0 to 3 will give you 7 9 and Harry because it it is going to include 0 1 2 no three no three is included okay so seven is included which is zero index number one is included which is nine index number two is included which is Harry index number three is not included so this will not return an error because we are including all these indexes let me run this program for you and you can see 79 Harry in case I happen to use four and let me press contrl D I have my shortcuts configured by the way if you if you're not able to replicate using contrl D um I'll create another video for visual studio code itself if you guys need a visual studio code video make sure you drop a comment and I'll definitely make one for you so L10 to4 will return you a list which contains index 0 which is 7 index one which is N9 index 2 which is Harry where is index 3 there's no index 3 so this will only get the data from 7 to Harry so it is going to print exactly the same thing which we were seeing in L10 to3 so L1 0 to4 is going to print the same thing as L10 to3 and L1 0 to 400 is going to print the same thing as well so let me demonstrate this for you let let me just zoom in and replicate this and let me try this out with 40 and you'll see 79 Harry will be printed then once again 79 Harry will be printed then again 79 Harry will be printed because we don't have index number three present in this list we have zero we have one we have two no index number three is present so let me run this program for you and you can see 79 Harry 79 Harry and 79 Harry so this is how uh list slicing works I hope I'm able to make things easier for you and now what we are going to do is we are going to look into some list methods before we move further and talk about list methods I want to tell you something I want to tell you something which I learned through experience list is going to be something which you'll use a lot in Python when I say a lot you're going to use it in every bigger code base you are going to write so make sure you grasp the concept of list very very well uh you are not going to use tles as much you're not going to use dictionaries as much but you are going to use lists a lot so make sure you understand these methods you understand the concept of list and you make sure that you you are you are very much satisfied when you are going um to the next chapter or going to the practice set so with that said let's talk about list methods so we have a sample list here we have 187 to 215 so let me create another file for you let me delete this stamp code Runner this is not something I created 03 underscore I'll say list methods so we'll talk about list methods in this particular um in this particular file let me close this and let me type the exact same list one then we have eight then we have 7 then two then we have 21 then we have 15 so exactly the same list 1 87 2 215 I just want to make sure that we are using the same list from from the notes in example so my list is equal to this now what I'll do is I'll start with the first function so the first function is sort it updates the list to this particular list so if I print my list I'll say my list and and I want to tell you something else so let us say you have a variable uh my list from of numbers okay so this is a pretty long variable name and you might get exhausted by typing it again and again in your program what you can do is you can type M for my and then you can type L for list this is in camel case camel case means that the very first letter of your word is h lower case and then the remaining letters are up a case so my list of numbers will be written as my then L will be Capital to specify this as a word then we have off then we have num so I can use m l n to type this so if I say ml n automatically you can see that this particular variable is being shown so M LF and press enter will type this list for you it's straightforward and it's very simple so when I have long variable names in my program and I suggest using long variable names if they are throwing light on the fact why they are created for example uh if you have a single list of numbers uh you can name your variable as my list of numbers do not name it as a b c d because you are not going to remember what uh what variable was a what variable was v um you don't want to do that you you want to make sure that variables you are creating are holding some meaning in their names okay so print my list of numbers is going to print this 1872 215 no surprises there so if I run my list of numbers do sort and I print this once again let me copy this and let me paste it again what you'll see is that the list is sorted now in increasing order in ascending order you can see when it's 72 215 was um how my previous list used to look now what you'll see is 1 2 7 8 15 21 is uh the sorted list so this is how sort function Works did you notice something dot sort doesn't return anything but what it does is it updates the list let's see what it returns when I say Returns what if I do a is equal to this and try to print a and let me run this program once again so when I say print a it is not returning anything it is returning none so make sure that this is not returning anything but it is modifying the original list itself so make sure that it is not returning anything but it is modifying the list which it is being operated on okay so my list of number now becomes 1 2 7 8 15 and 21 okay so this is how it works now what I'll do is um I'll move move on to the next method which is reverse so if I say L1 do reverse it's going to update the list to 1521 2781 which means it's going to reverse the list so let me write it here and let's not do a is equal to let me write a comment here what I'll do is I'll write a comment sorts the original list okay so now what I'll do is I'll say reverses the original list so I don't want to remove this the original list reverses the original list and let me use this reverse method and let's run this program I I'm I'm going to comment this out because I don't want to sort my list and then reverse it I just want to reverse it okay so let me run this program and you can see 1521 2781 just like I've written in the comments in the notes is being displayed okay what if I want to append something to a list now appending means adding something at the end of the list what if I want to add something to the end of the list I can use this append method and let's use this append method and I'm going to comment this one out and I'll say add uh add nine at the end of the of the original list okay and I'm going to use EPN and I'm going to use nine I'm going to add nine at the end of the list okay so let's add nine at the end of the list and you can see that nine has been added at the end of the list so this is basically modifying the the original list it's not returning a new list this is something that you need to remember this is modifying the original list when I'm saying my list of numbers do append n this list is being changed okay not a new list is being returned okay so this is something that you need to remember now what I'll do is I'll uh use insert now append will insert at the end of the list what if you want to insert at a particular index you can use insert okay so let's try to use this insert I'll comment this one and I'll say 2 comma 9 and I'll use insert now I'll say inserts 9 at index 2 okay at index 2 okay let's see if it's actually inserting 9 at index 2 you can see 9 has been inserted at index 2 so 0 one 2 so at index 2 we now have nine previously we had seven at index 2 but now we have nine at index 2 so this is something insert function has done okay now let's talk about another function which is pop so pop will delete element from the end of the list and if you specify an index it will delete the element at that index let's see how pop works okay let me comment this out and what I'll do is I'll say pop I I'll simply say pop pop okay uh I'll remove this comment if I run this you can see that 15 has been deleted what if I run pop twice will it delete two elements from the end yes it will do that let's see how this works so uh this pop deleted 15 this pop deleted 21 we have 1872 as a final list okay now what if I run pop once again will it delete three items yes it will keep on deleting as you keep running this method okay so pop pop pop will delete 15 21 and two respectively okay now uh if if I run this program I'll see 187 as my final list this is very evident now what I'll do is I'll simply add it once I'll say removes removes an item from the of the list okay and from the given index from the list okay so if I say pop two let me comment this one you'll see that seven has disappeared so at index 2 we had seven previously but now we don't have seven anymore we have8 7 21 and 15 okay so we don't have 7 at index 2 we have two because 7 has been removed because we ran pop two on our original list okay so this is how pop works now let's see how remove works so if you run remove you can remove a particular item from a list uh what if we have duplicate items uh before before that let's demonstrate remove then we'll talk about the case when we have duplicate items in the list what if I say remove two so remove two will actually remove this two this item from the list okay removes a given item from from the list okay so from the list okay so my list of numbers. remove to will remove this and we'll be left with 187 to 21 and 15 uh as the final list 187 21 15 in the final list because two will be removed so two will be removed and the remaining items will form the list so if I say my list of numbers. remove two and if I run this you can see that two has been removed what if I want to remove 21 I can very well do that I can simply remove 21 and you can see 21 has been removed what if we have duplicate items in the list what if we have two 21s what if we have this as a list what will happen let me add spaces here just so that it looks beautiful these spaces don't matter but I just added these spaces to make it look beautiful okay you can do one more thing to make it look beautiful you can simply right click and click on format document and this will actually install a formatter which will format your code but I don't want to do this at this point okay we can manually format the code it's fine okay so my list of numbers was this list now I want to remove 21 from this list but the problem is 21 occurs twice one after after two and the other 21 is after 15 how do I remove this 21 from the list let me run this code and see which 21 is removed okay so first occurrence is removed which is good first occurrence is removed so first occurrence of a number is uh of an item is removed from a list so an item can be a number it can be a string it can be a list as well so let me write removes first occurrence of item removes uh the first occurrence of a given item from the list okay so it will remove the first occurrence so I have written it here remove 21 from the list but after watching the video you know that 21 will be the first occurrence of 21 okay we didn't had any duplicate items so I'll keep my list as original 187 22115 187 2215 yes now let's talk about tles in Python so tle is an immutable data type in Python what what does it mean what do I mean when I say tupple is an immutable data type in Python immutable means something which cannot change uh as you saw in the case of list we were changing the list again and again by running the function sometimes we adding something at the end of the list sometime we are removing something from the list sometimes we are offending to the list the original list is affected my list of number was being affected and it was changed the same is not the case with tles tle is something which cannot be changed Yes you heard that right it cannot be changed it is immutable so if I say 04 4ore tles py I can actually show you how a tuple looks like I can say my tle is equal to did you see how I use these parenthesis to create a tle I can use these parenthesis and I can add three six and seven inside this tle what if I print this tle let me print this tle and see what is printed on the screen as you can see 3 six and 7 has been printed on the screen what if I print the type of this tle let me try to see what type this stle is class tle should be printed and yes class tle is printed which means that tle in itself is a data type just like we had strings just like we had integers just like we had floating Point numbers okay so tle in itself is a data type now this is a data type which cannot be changed so if I try to change this tle I should see something some error message okay so if I say tle 0 is equal to 8 I should see an error you can see that tle object does not support item assignment so it's telling me that what you are going to do is not allowed in Python if you want to do this you can create a list but tle just cannot be changed okay so I'll write here this will throw an error so this will actually throw an error okay so my double 0 is equal to 8 will throw an error because because you cannot change a tle now you can create an empty tle like this you can say a is equal to blank parenthesis and it will create a tle you can create Tuple with only one element and you'll need to add a comma at the end okay I I'll tell you why so why is a comma needed when you're creating an empty tle so let me do something let me comment this out and let me show you how a empty tble looks like so if I do something like this class tle is printed and an empty tle is printed so it is actually a tle okay what if I write four inside this parenthesis and what if I run it class int is printed but I intended to create a tle why is integer printed this is printed because something inside parenthesis will be treated as an individual item sometimes you might do something like this and accidentally create a tle so if you want to say 4 multip by 7 you might accidentally create a tle so python doesn't allow you to create tles of single items like this so what to do if you want to create a tle with just a single element inside that doule you need to add a comma you need to add a comma to tell python that hey python I'm I don't mean four here I actually mean tle of a single element which is four so python will say okay so you need a tle with just one element so you need to add a comma at the end of that element but but if you don't add that comma I'll literally take this element and assign it to my tle so you don't want that you want a tupple with element four okay so I'll save it and if I run it you'll see class tle as you can see we have four comma and the class is tle because this is a tble with four as the value inside it okay I hope you got this I hope that was easy so we saw what Tes are we saw how to create an empty tle we also saw how tle with one elements needs a comma and we also saw doubles of more than one element once defined a tubles elements cannot be altered to manipulated you cannot change the elements of Tes okay now let's talk about some tle methods consider the following Tes let me create another file for you let me create 05 uncore tle methods tle methods underscore methods. py so tore methods. py is a file and let me add a tle here and a is equal to 172 do not use ABC as the name of variables in Python uh when you're creating your production code bases this will definitely work but when you have a lot of variables and you have a b d dbb LL KK as your variable names you'll not be able to make out which variable is doing what okay so you need to have some meaning in your variable names if if you are creating a variable for storing username go ahead and type username don't be lazy do not type ABCD because it's going to create problems for you in the future type username type username or list of username list of username is a pretty big variable name but go ahead and type it because you have powerful IDs and source code editors like Visual Studio code these days they are going to type everything for you if you have a very large variable name like this uh just like I created in list methods my list of numbers simply say m l o n and press enter and my list of numbers will be automatically typed by vs code so you don't have to be uh lazy and um you don't have to type AB BCD as your variable names okay so let's jump to tle methods and see how tle methods work so if I say a do count this will count the occurrence of a given element inside that tle okay so a count will return number of items uh number of times one occurs in a okay let's see if it works let me try to print uh a do count and let me say one this should actually return one because I just have a single one what if I have three ones what if I add three ones inside this tble will it return three indeed it will return three because I have three elements inside this tble okay so this is how count method works we have another method called index and this will return the index of first occurrence of a given element inside the Tuple okay let's see how it works so if I say say uh a do index and if I say 1 this will not return Me 0 1 2 3 this will not return return me three or four this will return return me zero because zero is the first occurrence of one inside this tble so I'll see Zero okay let me comment this one out uh I'll see Zero but if I have 10 at the beginning of the tle I'll see 0 1 2 3 I'll see three as the first occurrence of one because at index 3 one occurs for the first time okay or if I make it two I can even make it two and make it two here as well two will occur for the first time at index 2 so 0 1 2 so this will return two let me show you this will return two if I make it 12 this will actually return three because at index three two occurs for the first time 0 1 2 3 so at index 3 two occurs for the first time so this will return three as you can see let me make it as one and it will keep the result as same because I'm talking about the index of two it has nothing to do with one or 10 okay so this is how index function works this is how count function works so this was the curated list of all the methods you want to use with list and tles I hope you enjoyed this chapter make sure you download the notes and make sure you have a print out of these notes because if you have print out and have these notes at your disposal it will it will be very very beneficial for you to revise and even while you are coding you can refer to these notes and it will be very beneficial for you I hope this video helps now we'll uh practice about list and tles and we'll move on to chapter 4 practice set now so let's move ahead and look into the chapter 4 practice set which I've created for you so this is a PDF of chapter 4 which I've created for you let me open this folder in my vs code uh let's close all the tabs in vs code so I'll simply say close all this will close all the tabs and believe me I usually do it very very frequently sometimes when I'm working on a larger code base what happens is I happen to open a lot of files and all of those files keep open at the top and it creates a lot of confusion I'll show you what I mean by this so you'll have a lot of files open and uh there will be only two or three files you'll be working with but a lot of files will be open feel free to do this and open files which you are working with okay so this is something I'm I wanted to tell you uh let's create another file let's say 06 underscore because this is a sixth program of this particular chapter so I'm saying 06 underscore and I'll say uh practice set one pr01 py so this is the practice Set uh question one of my chapter number four so let's open the PDF and see what chapter 4 practice set question number one has to say so it says write the program to store seven fruits in a list entered by the user so it has to be entered by the user so this is something you need to keep in mind so you have to write a program to store seven fruits in a list entered by the user so seven fruits have to be entered by the user so let's do something like this I'll say F1 is equal to my fruit one I'll say input I'll say enter fruit one okay and I'll say back sln or rather what I'll do is I'll do this I'll say enter fruit one then I'll do the same thing with fruit two I'll use alt and click um here and here to create two cursors and then once again I'll do the same thing here I'll say enter uh sorry fruit three and then we'll do the same thing with oops I added a three here um then I'll do the same thing with fruit four so we have four fruits and now what I'll do is I'll simply create a list and I'll call it fruit list I'll say fruit list contains F1 F2 and then it will have F3 and then once again it will have F4 okay so these are the list of uh all the fruits which have been entered so far by the user now what I'll do is I'll print this list as demanded by the question so I should see the list of four fruits which have been endered by the user and they all will be string we know that input returns a string okay so let's run this program and see what happens Ender fruit one I'll say banana then um I'll say uh guava then I'll say apple grapes so Banana guava Apple grapes uh this is how we solve this problem okay quite simple problem but again I added this so that you get adequate practice uh let's move on to the next question now write a program to accept marks of six students and display them in a sorted manner now this might sound challenging but it is not because we have a function which sorts the items in in an array okay in a list by the way now that I have used array in place of list mistakenly let me tell you array is something we call to list in other programming language so the collection of items uh in other programming languages like C and Java is called an array and the same thing here is called as a list okay so uh when somebody says create an array in Python they mean List most of the times Okay so next question says write a program to accept marks of six students let's accept the marks of six students um and I'll use the same program I'll leverage the same program because we already have uh so many inputs written so what I'll do is I'll say 07 pr02 py so question number two from my chapter 4 okay so program number seven practice set question number two and the question says that you need to take marks of six students as input so six student students uh are entering their uh their marks okay so what I'll do is I'll make it m i want to make it marks let me make it marks and let me make this enter marks of student one I'll say enter marks of student one enter marks of student two then three then four then five okay so marks of student five and we need marks of six students if I'm not wrong so what I'll do is I'll add another one and I'll say Mark 6 enter marks of student 6 then I'll do the same with the list I'll say marks list is equal to and then I'll say uh marks one then Marx 2 marks 3 then I'll say Marx 4 and then marks 5 okay Marx five now what I'll do is I'll print this list okay so I'll say marks list ml marks list okay now if I run this program uh but before I run this program I need to run uh sort function okay I need to run this sort function but make sure that these marks are supposed to be an integer you can see that I've written very clearly in the problem statement that accept marks of six students and the marks of six students are going to be integers okay so do not confuse these with um with with string marks or with Mark of some other data type let's make them integer and uh let's cast all these values to in so this might sound like some advanced stuff but it is not believe me um I'm simply saying cast all these numbers which are entered in the form of string to an integer okay so I'm converting all of these to an integer by the way I press end key on my keyboard so end key on my keyboard is something I pressed and I can close this now and I can save it and let me show you that if I enter uh so I'm going to enter say 10 then I'm going to enter 20 then I'm going to enter five then I'm going to enter 30 then 40 then 50 and then uh you'll see that I have just five marks uh not sure why this happened 1 2 3 4 5 6 2 3 4 5 so there's something some mistake I made marks 2 marks Okay so I didn't enter Mark 6 let me enter Mark 6 as well so I made a mistake here uh but again if you see let let me type it once again uh 1020 530 40 50 I I'll enter the same thing let me enter it um I'll say 10 and then say 20 5 30 40 50 and you can see that five has been shifted to the beginning of the list why because I've sorted the list and if I sort the list uh it'll sort in a sending order in case you want to sort a list in descending order what you can do is you can simply reverse the list after sorting so dot sort will arrange your list in increasing order and then if you reverse the same list you'll find that your list has been reversed and automatically this will sort your list in decreasing order or descending order okay so I hope you got the point by default it is ascending order if you want to uh keep sending order what you can do is you can add reverse call after the do sort call okay so let's move on to the next question now check that a tle cannot be changed in Python and this one is going to be very easy and I recommend that do not create a python file for this program what I want to teach you is uh at times you'll have to test certain things in Python what will happen if you do certain thing in Python and you don't want to create files for all those programs if you want to test something in a single line so what I recommend in those case is open your terminal it can be the builtin terminal from your Visual Studio code or it can be your windows Powershell and simply write python here what I do is I write python here and I use rapple and I've told you about repple in chapter number one if I'm not wrong um what I'll do is I'll simply say u a is equal to none and let me see if I can use sort with none I cannot use sort with none I know that but let us assume that I want to test it I want to make sure that this returns an error and I can now confidently say that yes this will return this error I don't have to create a file I don't have to run that file again and again I don't want to do all that I don't want to create a folder I can simply fire up my repple and uh at the drop of a hat I can simply type something bang close the terminal and you know what happens when you do a certain thing in Python okay so let me try to change the tble let me create a tble I'll say a is equal to I'll simply say 1 2 3 uh or let me keep it 1 2 4 and you can add that add this extra comma you don't have to add it you have to add it if you're creating a tle with a single element this is important and what most of the programmers do is they keep this comma at the end of the element just to make sure if their tle has been changed in the future with tle of only single element what they can do is um they can ensure that their double of single element is actually a double and not an integer okay but here I want to see if I can change this tle so I'll press enter key now if I press a I know that this is a tle if I if I want to see type of a I can see it's class T no surprises there um but what I want to do is I want to see what a z returns it will return one can I change this a z i can use arrow keys by the way I can use up and bottom arrow keys uh from my keyboard to browse my command history and navigate to all these commands which I've already uh used in the past okay so I I've used Ty type A I've used a I've used a equal 1 to4 I have used a do sort I have used a equal to none I can use my bottom Arrow key now to come back to this command and let me try changing this to 34 I know I can't do that but let's check yes type error tle object does not support item assignment you can't do this this is something reppel is telling you you can't do that okay so this is the error you are going to get so we are going to create python files in most of the cases and we are going to write programs into these files but for quick things we are going to use rapple and this is going to be a very good deal for us because we don't have to create files we don't want to have a folder with Messy files we just want to create files for something we need in the future um I you can use this rule of them I create python files for uh programs if they exceed five to seven lines uh mostly if they are within five to seven lines including Imports I use repple and obviously if you want to save your program even if your program is a single line you can create a Python program I hope that makes sense let's move ahead now and let's talk about uh the next problem so the next problem says that write a program to sum a list with four numbers and you can simply do this using uh a function called sum but we can also do this using indexing so uh let's try to create a list with four numbers first and this is problem number four so I'll say eth program problem number four and let's create a python file now what I'll do is I'll say my list is equal to what I'll do is I'll say 1 2 4 5 and this is a list of four numbers now what I'll do is I'll sum this list so let me sum this list I'll say sum is equal to zero so sum is a variable and I have assigned this variable to zero now what I'll do is I'll say sum plus equals to so add this particular thing in sum which particular thing my list zero add this to sum and do this for one do this for two do do this for three and finally print this the value of sum is and you can use plus and then sum so the value of sum is or you can even use comma you can use comma as well the value of sum is and you'll see the sum what is the sum 4 + 3 is 7 and 7 + 5 is 12 let's see if we get 12 print it onto the console yes we do get 12 and you don't have to add the space here because when you're using comma a space is automatically appended so I don't have to use the space so a single space is what I needed not double space I was getting this double spacing because um this particular thing um it was already printing a space and I again added a space after is I didn't intend it to do that okay so this is something I wanted to tell you so this is this is how you add four numbers from a list and we'll talk about how to add a list of uh length greater than four or a list of variable length a list of any length for that matter but this was something I added just for your indexing practice I wanted you to learn list indexing so let's move on to the next question and next question says write a program to count the number of zeros in the following tle and let me open this chapter 4 PDF as well because what I want is I want you to look into this PDF and look into the methods which we have talked about in this PDF we have talked about count and we are going to use that count so let's create this tle and let's use count function to count the number of zeros in this Tuple so let me create a new file here I'll say 09 uncore I'll say PR 05. py okay and after I do this what I'll do is I'll create this tle first of all 78009 so 7 8 009 and yes I need to add commas here so let me add commas here okay and uh this is a tle let me let me use Tu is equal to and now I have to print the number of zeros in this T I'll say the number of zeros in this tle is how many zeros are there in this tle count of so I'll say uh I want to use uh tle do count and I want to count number of zeros in this tle and this will return me the number of zeros in the tle let's see if this works let's run this program and you can see the number of zeros in this stle is three by the way I also want to tell you that you don't have to use code Runner if you want to Simply use a terminal and want to run all these files manually simply type Python and simply type the file name I'm typing 09 and I'll press Tab and pressing tab will simply uh add this 09 uncore pr05 p okay so pressing tab autoc completes the file name it will look into all the files in your file system and if it finds any unique match what it does is it simply adds uh the remaining characters and you can autocomplete you know so I can press enter and you can see that I can run this program by firing Python and then the name of the file okay so this is easy and I I hope you understood that okay so this was a okay I I accidentally added this Discounter I don't want to add this uh so this was our uh python chapter 4 practice set I hope you learned a lot about list and Tes and believe me you're going to use this a lot in your python Journey let's move ahead and let's move to chapter number five now where we'll Explore More python stuff so let's now move on to chapter number five and see what chapter number five has for us so here is the PDF of chapter number five and we are going to be studying dictionaries in chapter number five and and python dictionaries are amazing let me tell you because you can store key value pairs inside a dictionary and it really feels good and sometimes you really need all these things so let's see what a dictionary is and then we'll uh look into the syntax and also we'll start coding some of the Python dictionaries um let's see why they are useful and how you can use them so dictionaries a collection of key value pairs as I've already told you just like you have a collection of words and meanings in an Oxford dictionary you must have definitely used an Oxford dictionary in the past and this is none other than uh the Oxford dictionary which you have already used uh let's see the syntax of python dictionaries and then we'll move forward so what I'll do is I'll open this particular uh folder in VSS code and uh let me also create a file so what I'll do is I'll say 01 tick. py let me tell you something you should never name your program with something which can be a python internal keyword for example never ever name your normal programs as test.py numpy py or say os. py for that matter you should never ever do that uh I I see this mistake from a lot of people and they really suffer and they uh wonder why why their programs are not working uh their program doesn't work because they they are committing all these kinds of mistakes so let me tell you what a dictionary is let's create a dictionary let let me call It Oxford okay uh and what I'll do is I'll say Oxford is equal to and um let me say uh let me say uh gift and uh something so I've written something willingly given to someone to appreciate so this is this is the gift okay and let me also write something else let me put a comma here and uh let me say uh this and let me say a keyword in C++ let me also say YouTube and a video sharing platform and I'll also say Instagram and let me say uh picture sharing platform and let me save it and once I save it I can print this and this code is going to work just fine um let me print this Oxford and let me run it by the way if you are wondering how I um customize my vs code like this I'll tell you in a moment but let me run this code and show you that this dictionary is actually working okay so let me tell you which theme I'm using I'm actually using this jellyfish theme which is actually an amazing theme from uh pav borker uh you can simply install this theme and your vs code will look just like mine uh I keep on changing themes it's not like I'll stick to this theme in the future I might change the theme it depends upon my mood and a lot of other factors so it's not like the theme uh matters the most in the productivity it sometimes matters for me but again what I'll do is I'll simply um go to settings and show you how I enabled font lies so what you can do is you can simply go to your uh you can go to your settings and you can search for font likees and you can enable font likees so what you have to do is simply type editor do font likees true so you should be having this line editor do font likees it might be false or it might be none what you have to do is simply make this editor. font lies as true so what this will do is this will enable few font lies uh for example if you are writing something like this uh this changes to this Arrow so what I've done is I've written this and a greater than symbol so uh it actually looks like this and if I say not equal it looks like this so all these things are enabled and all these things makes your code a lot more readable so this is something which is very useful but coming back to the notes and coming back to the dictionary it's a collection of key value pairs as we have already seen and you can have key and value not only as strings but you can also use lists you can also use um say tles let me show you uh so if I put Instagram as let let me put my list let me put my list as something so I'll say my list and what I'll do is I'll simply put a list here so I can use list as values I cannot use list as Keys uh let me make it clear for you you cannot do something like this uh you you you cannot do something like this if I run this you're going to get an error let me run this and it says unhashable type list so list is an unhashable types and you can have only the hashable types as Keys okay so this is something that you need to um take care of okay okay so let me remove this line as this is not valid let me come back to notes and let me show you how to print a particular value corresponding to a key so if you want to print a value corresponding to a key all you have to do is simply say Oxford and the name of the key so if I say this and uh I run the program I should be getting a keyword in C++ uh so it says None type object is not subscriptable I've made a mistake here I should have written this something like this or password this and if I run this you can see a keyword in C++ and this is the output from this particular line let me comment this line and you should be only seeing uh a keyword from C++ a keyword in C++ is printed on the screen uh as expected uh let's now talk about python dictionaries uh what are the properties of python dictionaries so it is unordered uh the the order is not preserved it is mutable it is indexed it cannot contain duplicate keys so you cannot have another this and you cannot have something else as the value so if I try to do something like this and if I say that uh and if I try to run this you are essentially overwriting that value and and you need not do that okay so what I'll do is I'll remove this line so it is definitely unordered you cannot expect it to preserve orders and it is mutable it is indexed and it cannot contain duplicate keys so uh let me show you some of the dictionary method so that it is clear to you uh there is a method called items which returns a list of key value Pairs and this is really very useful when you want to iterate a dictionary let me show you um if I uh open a file let me name it as Z doore dick methods. py and let me copy this dictionary as is so what I'll do is I'll copy this dictionary and I'll show you how you can run all the methods on this dictionary so if I say print oord do items I'll get a toule of um key value pairs so you can see that I have a toule of key value pairs a tle of key value pairs a toule of key value pairs I can actually iterate it using fall Loop you you'll see how I can do that I can say for a comma B in ox. items and uh if I do this and if I print A and B let me say A and B and let me comment this out you can see my list 1 3 4 Instagram a picture sharing platform so essentially what it is doing is it is storing uh the key in a and the value in B for all the key value paers in the dictionary and it's actually printing it because I have written print a comma B uh if I want to format it something like this if I want to say uh colon and comma let me run this for you and show you how it appears so so I have a colon here if I say colon equals to I mean I mean you can format it U however you want to okay there's no hard and fast rule a will contain the key and B will contain the value so this is how you can use a do items it returns a list of key value Tes now um a do Keys it returns just the dictionaries Keys you'll not have values so if I say a do Keys uh I can say something like this I can say um for key in ox. keys and if I print key you'll see that the key is printed let me comment this particular thing out and let me run this code for you and you'll see only the keys of the dictionaries being printed this is super useful if you want to just uh print the keys or if you want to do something with only the keys of the dictionary uh let me go back to this um page from my notes I can actually use a. update which will actually update the dictionary with supplied key value pairs so update can actually add an item to the dictionary it can also change an existing item in the dictionary let me show you how so what I'll do is I'll simply say oxford. update do update I'll say uh I'll Supply a dictionary I'll say Harry and then I'll say good boy and then what I'll do is I'll say my list and you can use single double codes it doesn't matter okay you can either use single codes or you can use double codes doesn't matter I can say 56 and then I can say eight okay let me run this for you and we'll we'll actually print the um keys from the dictionary actually the key value pairs from the diary let me comment this out uh if I run this code what what will happen is uh the my list will change uh okay so I actually uh made a mistake here I should have written small all l so the keys are case sensitive you need to use exactly the same case you intend to so you can see that my list has been changed and Harry and good boy this key value pair has been added to my dictionary and and actually I wanted to do that which is why I ran oxford. update I hope this is clear to all of you uh let me come back to the nodes and let me show you one more method which is a.get and this simply Returns the value of the specified keys and values returned okay now why should I use a dog why can't I simply do something like this um something like this what what what if I say this six let us say I have added an arbitrary key which is not present in the diary and if I try to run this program you can see my program is terminated with an error if you don't want an error in your program when the keys are not present in the dictionary what you can do is you can actually use get and it will return none so if instead of um print oord um let me say not present so not present is a key which is not present in my dictionary I have gift this YouTube uh Instagram my list but I don't have this not present if I try to run this program this program is throwing an error and I don't want my program to throw an error so what I'll do is I'll simply say um print Oxford doget and I'll use this not present now what will happen is my program will not throw an error rather it will print none it will tell me that this particular key is not present in the dictionary so this is super useful once again if you don't want your programs to throw errors um and and believe me this this really works wonders uh you don't have to use try catch which we are going to be studying in the later chapters you don't have to use that if you simply want to do a key look up in your dictionary now let's see uh some of the more methods which are available on docs. python.org uh for the sake of time I'm not going to docs. python.org and look into all the methods of dictionaries but let me tell you that these are the most commonly used methods which you'll ever use which you'll ever need I mean I can't promise that these are the only methods which you'll ever need but I can definitely tell you that these are the methods which you are going to need 80% of the times so you are you you are good to go if you are a beginner and with practice you're going to learn more methods and that's how it works now let's talk about sets in Python what is a set have you ever uh heard of set in mathematics if you have heard of set in mathematics you you should be you should be able to understand what a set in Python is so it's exactly the same set which you have already learned in your mathematics uh but this is a a programmatic version I I should say uh so sets in Python is a collection of non-repetitive elements in mathematics we study set as a set is a collection of well defined objects here set is a collection of non- repetitive elements so if you say s is equal to set no repetition is allowed s do add1 s do add2 uh this is going to generate a set with uh one and two inside of the set now if I run s do add two once again this is not going to add two to my set yet again because two is already present in the set I hope you are getting me if you are a programming beginner without much knowledge of mathematical operators on sets you can simply look at sets and python as data types containing unique values that's it you don't have to you don't have to stress into sets too much at this point and believe me when you're writing a simple Python program all you'll need is the set and the add method from the set and uh we use set when we don't want to collect something twice so uh at times when I'm doing data scraping or web scraping for that matter what I want to do is I want to have unique items in my um I should say object I want to have some object which can actually collect unique items so if if you're looking for unique items from a pool of items you keep on adding to a set rather than adding it to a dictionary or adding it to some other uh object for that matter now let's see the properties of sets sets are unordered you cannot expect sets to have ordered now they are unindexed you cannot access Elements by index you cannot say uh uh let us say if you have a variable called my set you cannot say that I want to access third element of the set you cannot say that I want to access 10th element of the set this is not how set Works uh now there is no way to change items in the sets so if you have an item you cannot change the items because uh it it's simply a bag of items so if you have a bag of items you cannot say change that item because you cannot access item using indices I hope I'm making sense here uh now uh let me create this set here and let me show you some of the operations on sets so consider this set where I have S is equal to 182 and three so 1 8 2 and three are elements in the Set uh and what you can do is you can run all these methods on the set but before I move on to methods let me show you something let me create a set for you and let me show you how sets work okay so let me come back to my vs code let me create a file called 03 sets. py and once I have this file what I'll do is I'll create a set for you so I'll say my set is equal to is this an empty set is this an empty set no this is not an empty set if you hover over this uh you are going to get uh a dict it's a dict why why is it a dict I want to have a set when you type a set of curly braces all python understands is that you are trying to create a dictionary it cannot read your mind okay so if you want to create a set you can either specify few values so it will it will uh know that it is not a set of key value pairs so it's not aition it's a set for sure so now if you H over this my set it's actually a set of integers okay now what you want is you want to um find the length of the set let us say you can simply say Len of my set and this will actually return the length of the set which is three so it has three elements now if I say my set do add 45 now if I try to access this um Len of my set I should get four because I've added another item now I want all of you to comment below what is going to be the output of print Len of my set because I have added one again to the set so would it be five or would it be something else I want you to comment with the time stamp put the time stamp of the video and write a comment so that I can see that uh and tell me that what will be the output of Len of my set if you guessed it right it's going to be four because it's not going to be five one is already present in the set so if I try to add one yet again this is not going to add one to the set let me show you that it's going to be four and not five because one is already present in the set if you if you add an element which is already present in the set it's not going to add that element it's simply going to ignore it uh now now let me show you something else if I do something like this if I do um double quotes and one and double quotes if I try to add this particular thing to the set I want you guys to comment below what is going to happen uh is len of my set going to return five now if not why write write a comment below I want you guys to write a comment below um okay so you guessed it right it's going to be five at this point because uh one as an integer this particular one and this particular one are two different different objects in Python's eyes it's not exactly the same thing because one is a string here and one is an integer here so if I run this you'll see five okay I hope I hope things are making sense at this point let's look into some other methods of um python sets if you say s. remove it will update the set and remove that particular element from the set if you say s. popop it removes an arbitrary element from the set and Returns the element removed so this this is a very interesting function if you want to return something at random uh remove something at random you can simply use s. pop so let's try some of these functions let's try remove I've added one and what I'll do is I'll print the set I'll say print my set and let me also remove this so I'll say my set. remove and let me remove 34 from the set and Print set once again so I'll say print my set and let me run this program okay so as you can see that I have this particular Set uh which is printed uh from my line number four and I have this set which is printed by my line number seven so 34 1 53 all these elements are present in the set now I have removed 34 I have added one so since I've added one yet again it's not going to have any effect because one as a string is already added and if if I print my set 34 will be removed from that set and the length will be four because I have removed 34 right so this is how all these functions work now if I say print my set. pop it's going to remove an element at random and it's going to return that element so let me print myet after running this my set. poop and if I run this program you can see that uh it has uh let me run it once again uh it has chosen one and one has been removed from the set and the length of the set is three and this is the set after one is removed from the set so I have removed 34 I've removed something at random which is one I've used pop so it's going to Simply pop an element from out of the set let me run this yet again and you can see that it is removing one uh so this is how it works okay so what I'll do now is I'll simply show you how clear works so s do clear will empty the set you can test it yourself now what is Union and intersection this is something I want to explain you uh because this is actually important and let me tell you something you don't have to dip deep into this one this is something which you might already know if you have learned sets in your class 11th or um maybe class 10th or 9th in some cases but uh this is actually a very easy thing so Union is you are combining two sets so s is a set it contains some element and you are adding some element from another set to this set now that set might already have 8 and 11 it if it already has 8 and 11 8 and 11 will not be added if it has 8 and 11 it will not be added and if it doesn't have 8 and 11 it's going to be added so Union is simply adding all these items one by one to the set what is intersection what is intersection intersection will check which values are there in the set and return only those values out of these values let me show you an example so um this is a set 1823 is a set now if I say Union I'm going to Union this set with this set 1 8 2 3 Union 81 now 8 is already present in this set so 11 will be added to this set and the final set will become 1 18 2 31 as you can see here now what about intersection intersection will actually see which elements are common between this one and this one so what are the elements common is eight present in both the sets yes eight is present in both the sets is 11 present in both the sets no 11 is not present in both the sets it's not present here so eight is the output so you'll see eight as the output so Union means uh all the elements combined from both the sets intersection means Elements which are present in both the sets so this is a vend diagram this is something um which you might have studied in your mathematics and you don't have to emphasize a lot into this if you are not uh a mathematics person so R1 is this area R2 is this area and R3 is this area R1 R2 R3 these all combined is a union B A is this Circle B is this circle R1 + R2 + R3 is a union B if you combine all these areas uh you'll get a union B R1 + R3 is a triangle B uh let's not talk much about it because I'm I think I'm going a lot into mathematics I don't want to go a lot into mathematics and R2 is the area which is present in both the sets so it's a intersection B now R1 is a minus B and R3 is B minus a R1 is not the entire circle R1 is this particular part of the circle R1 is actually a minus R2 so if you remove R2 from the circle this area is R1 I hope I'm making sense here I hope you understood what I want to explain and this is all about dictionary and sets now what we'll do is we'll move to chapter 5 practice set we'll have some practice for sets and dictionaries and it is going to give us some confidence so let's move on to chapter 5 practice set now so let's now talk about chapter 5 practice set which is going to be practice on dictionary so what I'm going to be doing now is I'll open this chapter 5 practice set and we'll create few programs and we'll understand how these programs use dictionaries and sets Okay so let's open this particular folder in vs code I'll right click and open this in vs code we already have few files open so let's do one thing let me close all these files and let's create another file 04 uncore p1. py so we are going to solve problem number one here let's see what problem number one has for us so it says write a program to create a dictionary of Hindi words with values as your English translation so you just have to create another Oxford dictionary it's really very simple thing uh just provide user with an option to look it up okay so uh you have to provide an option for the user to look it up so what I'll say is I'll say Oxford is equal to and I think I've already done this here I've already done this here uh but I just have to uh do Hindi to English or English to Hindi translation so uh what I'm going to be doing is I'll say uh lucky and then I'll say w and I'll say uh Cy is chair and um what else uh chaku is knife and you can use any language of your choice um let me now give an option to the user to look it up so what I'll do is I'll say uh I'll say uh key is equal to input and I'll ask the user for for the key and the dictionary is going to give the corresponding value so what I'll do is I'll say input enter the key okay and I'll also say say back sln and this is going to print um a new line here okay so let's now uh print um I'll say the value corresponding to your key is and I I'll print that value as simple as that and what will I use I'll use dotg I I'll use dot get and um I'll not use the um square bracket syntax because if if the value is not found I'm going to be in trouble okay so what I'll do is I'll say oxford. getet and then I'll say key now if I run this program you'll see uh if I enter uh lucky you'll say the corresponding value uh to your keys is wood okay and if I enter something else which is not present in the dictionary you can say that none is printed on the screen but this doesn't look good right uh I should I I I'll uh I would love to have a prompt telling me that hey the value is not found in the dictionary so what I'll do is I'll say if I'll say if oxford. get key is equals to equals to null sorry none if this is equals to uh none what I would want um what I would want my python interpreted to do is I would want it to print value not found and else I'll say print this particular thing okay so let's run this once again and if I enter something which is not present in the dictionary it says value not found and let me enter something which is present in the dictionary and yes the value is found and let me remove this space because uh python automatically adds a space so let me say chaku and the value is knife cool cool this this really looks good okay so the problem number one is solved now let's move on to question number two which says write a program to input eight numbers from the user and display all the unique numbers and when I look at this word unique numbers what comes to my mind is yes you guess it right it sets so what I want is I want eight numbers and I want to pass it through the set or I can have a an empty set and I can have the user uh enter the numbers and I'm going to keep adding all these numbers to this set let's try this I'll come back to vs code and um I'll create another program and that's going to be 05 uncore U pr02 py okay so what we are going to be doing now is uh we will simply say uh create a set so I'll say s s is equal to set and then um what I'll do is I'll say s do add and um I'll say input okay enter your number okay and I'll run this for uh say five times or six times I don't know I think I should I should call it five times uh that's going to be fine so I'll say um for I in range and I'll say five and this is going to run this Loop five times uh let me let me look in in the question like how many times should I run it it's eight times so let me put eight in here so if I say for I in range eight I can I can add it and um I'll have an indent here and you can see that s. add input and uh input ENT your number is going to add that number to my set and finally I can print that set okay uh print s so let me do one thing I'll keep on entering 1 and two uh I'll keep on entering 1 and two 1 2 1 2 1 2 one two two and you can see finally the set only has one and two now you must be wondering what this fall Loop is I didn't teach this yet and why am I using this so this is a loop in Python and we are going to learn more about it for now think of it as a procedure to run something multiple times and if you want to avoid this you can simply say s do add eight times and I'm going to do that I don't want to use fall Loops just yet so let's comment this out and let's do this so this is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 okay so I'm adding 1 and 2 eight times to my set and uh also I should be adding some sort of uh you know space so back slash I I'll I'll add a space let me run this and let me save one two one two 3 4 1 2 and you can say three and you can see that 1 2 3 4 um have been added to the set okay so this is really very simple and straightforward no rocket science there uh let's see question number three now can we have a set with 18 as an integer and 18 as an Str Str as a value in it yes you can definitely have it because uh 18 as a string is a different object and 18 as an integer is a different object all together okay I hope you I hope you got the point I hope you are able to understand why we can add 18 18 um let me show you let me let me show you in this program itself so what I'll do is um I'll say um I'll add 18 I'll add 18 okay and then I'll run this program let me cancel this program um control C to cancel what I'll do is I'll simply say 18 and I'll say one one one one one one one one and and you can see that 18 as an integer and 18 as a string has been added to this particular set which is amazing okay so let me now um let me now move on to the next question which is what will be the length of the following set if I say s is equal to set and uh if I add 20 then 20.0 and then 20 length of s after these three operations I'm going to solve this problem problem on rapple if you remember what rle is I will simply say python I'll say s is equal to set by the way let me tell you that this particular syntax is going to create an empty dictionary and not set okay so you don't have to use this if you want to create an empty set you'll have to say s is equal to set okay so this is how you create a set and after you create a set what you can do is you can simply do this s do at 20 s 20.0 so I'll say s. 20 then I'll say s. 20 zero and then I'll say um SED 20 as a string okay and let's see how set looks like so as you just saw that 20 is added only once to this set and the reason is that 20 is equal to 20.0 so if you compare the value of 20 and 20.0 both the values are equal so 20 and 20.0 uh only one out of these will be added to the set okay I hope you got the point so the next question says s is equal to curly braces and uh what is the type of s so the type of s is simply a dictionary it's very simple and straightforward because uh when you say empty curly braces um s will be of type dictionary and S has been used in this question to confuse you to make you give the answer as set so s is actually a dictionary and it's not a set um now the next question create an empty dictionary allow four friends to enter their favorite language as values and use Keys as their names assume that the names are unique so it's a very simple and straightforward problem you just have to create an empty dictionary you says is equal to um curly braces and then what you can do is uh allow for friends to enter their favorite languages as values and use Keys as their names okay so you can simply use the names as keys and you can use um this syntax I just taught you the syntax um it's very simple and straightforward okay let's move on to the next question now if names of two friends are same what will be the what will uh happen to the programming problem number six so you'll have to look into this and solve it yourself because we have talked a lot about this in theory uh so I want you to practice this particular thing and uh see for yourself what's going to happen Okay so this is very simple uh I have already talked about this in my um in in the video uh in the chapter video Chapter number five dictionary insets now if languages of two friends are same what will happen to the program in problem number six so let me give you some spoilers here if the keys are same then only one of the keys can actually stay but if the values are same all the values can stay you can have multiple keys and you can have exactly the same value corresponding to all those multiple keys and your dictionary will just be fine so this is the answer to this problem number eight let's move on to question number nine now can you change the values inside a list which is contained in a set s and again very straightforward you cannot do that because you cannot access that list so since you cannot access that list you don't have any method to access this list you cannot use indexing insets by the way you cannot access this particular item so you cannot change it and that's the answer to question number n so that was chapter number five practice set for all of you I hope you enjoyed chapter number five and you were able to understand why we are using all these things the next chapter now is about conditionals and conditionals is really very important topic so let's move on to chapter number six and learn about conditionals from here we are going to start one of the most important topics of the entire python course which is conditional expressions and why am I saying this is important because this is something you are going to use most of the times when you are learning python so sometimes you want to play pubg on a phone if the day is Sunday so let us say the day is Sunday and you don't have to go to the school you don't have to go to the office or wherever you go and you have some free time and you decide to play pubg on your phone why did you decide to play pubg on your phone because the day is Sunday now let us say somebody ask whether I am playing pubg on my phone today or not what is the question you are going to ask is today Sunday if yes then yes I'm going to play pubg if no I'm not going to play pubg because I might be busy in some other work similarly sometimes we want to order ice cream online if the day is sunny if the day is rainy or if the day is very cool you might not want to order an ice cream because who who eats an ice cream I I mean you might argue that I love ice cream during rainy season or any season for that matter but usually people eat ice cream when it is sunny so let us assume a person like me who eats ice cream when it's sunny outside so let us say I am deciding whether I'm going to eat ice cream on the basis of weather outside so this is a decision based on something which is dependent on the weather now let us say you are going to hiking only if your parents allow so you're going to your parents and you going to ask do you want to allow me to go hiking with my friends and your parents might come back to you saying hey I don't want to uh want you to go for hiking in a very similar fashion python uses if else conditionals and we are going to look into all these conditionals all these are decisions we depend on a condition being met so your parents are either going to allow you for hiking or not you are going to eat ice cream uh based on whether it's sunny outside or not you are going to play pubg based on whether it's Sunday or not so you are looking at the day and you are deciding whether you are going to play the game or not so all these things depends on a condition being met and in Python Programming to we must be able to execute instructions on a condition or a set of conditions being met so if the value of a particular variable is greater than five I should be able to do something let us say I'm creating a bot and uh that bot is basically a table F I'm just assuming let us say I have this table F and I want this table F to turn on automatically or when the weather outside uh or in this room is is uh hot okay so if the weather is hot then I want this fan to turn on automatically and this can be done I can write a program let us say I have a temperature sensor I can say if temperature in de centigrade is greater than 27 turn this fan on if it is less than that do not turn this fan on so I can actually auto start this fan based on whether it's hot in the room or not in a very similar way Python Programming to uh has some set of if else statements which can be used to execute few lines of code when a given condition is met let's look into these if El statements and let's get started with coding very soon so if else and Al if statements are a multi-way decision taken by a program due to certain conditions in a code now how do I tell python that I want to execute some set of code when uh when when some condition is met so I'll simply say if I'll write this particular syntax so I I've written everything in the notes I strongly suggest that you download these um these notes and they are going to be very beneficial for you I have jotted down each and everything inside these notes for you people so if condition one and condition one is going to be some sort of uh variable which will evaluate to either true or false so you can say that condition one will evaluate to the value of true or false so if condition one is true you are going to see print yes then I've written this Al if here Al if means else if else if condition two is true print no otherwise you simply print maybe so firstly this condition is checked then this condition is checked and if both of these conditions are not met we simply say print maybe uh if none of these conditions are met print maybe will be executed so this is how this this works but this is not something which will execute I'll tell you why because condition one is not defined here so let's look into an example which will actually execute so let me go back to my folder and open this particular folder in VSS code I'll simply write the program I'll say 01 uncore if LF ls. py so it's a very basic program in which I'll simply tell you how you can uh use these IFL statements so you can say if a is greater then four then you simply print a is so let me use print statement I'll say you'll simply say a is greater than 4 uh then you'll say Al if if a is not greater than 4 it must be less than four you'll say l if a is greater than two simply say print a is greater than two uh so you can say a is greater than two okay um else you can say uh none okay nothing let me now run this code and show you what gets printed so nothing is printed why is nothing printed on the screen so firstly this particular condition will be checked is a greater than four definitely not it's not greater than four it's one which is lesser than four this will not be executed now the next thing is Al if is a greater than two definitely not a is one a is not greater great than two so this particular thing is also not executed if if is not executed Al if is not executed then definitely else has to get executed and nothing is printed on the screen but if I change this one to three things will change and I'll show you how if I run this code now you'll see that a is greater than two is printed why is a is greater than four not printed and a is greater than two printed not because uh do not look at it from the logical perspective look at it from the code perspective why are certain set of lines being executed a is equal to 3 is a greater than four no it's not greater than four so this will not be executed is a greater than two yes a is greater than two 3 is greater than two this will be executed and this if else letter will end so when we look at IFL statements we look at if else ladders at once so this if else letter has not yet ended this is linked with this L if and this is linked with else now if I start a new if statement here and this is a new if statement Al together this if statement has nothing to do with this letter I can create another letter I can even say if and L if and I can exclude else so if I don't write else this will still work so let me comment this and show you that this will still work so this particular thing is any if else letter either if or L if or else will get executed out of these three but if I make it if I mean if I change this L if to if this if else letter is independent and this is a separate if letter so both of these might get executed or none of these might get executed okay so this depends I'll show you an example so uh let me uncomment this and listen to me very very carefully because this is important now a is equal to 3 is a greater than 4 uh no so let me make it 30 is a greater than four yes this condition is true but condition inside LF is also true so which one will be printed first one will be printed second one will be printed or all three will be printed or first two will be printed so let me give you the answer only one out of if Al if and else will be executed from a particular letter so if I look at these bunch of if L if else statements I look at it as a single letter this is a letter and only one statement will be selected or rather I should say only one out of these if L if and else blocks will be selected by python interpreter let me see which is being selected so a is equal to 30 is a greater than four yes a is greater than four then this is selected and the control will directly jump outside this letter so it will not execute this particular code it will not execute this particular code I hope I'm making sense let me show you let me run this code and let me show you that a is greater than four is printed now if this condition is false so if I if I write something which is U you know greater than two but not greater than four if I make it three then definitely this particular thing will be executed only one out of these will be executed what will happen if I keep it 30 but I change this Al if to if if I change this L if to if this particular if else ladder is no longer part of this if L if El letter so now we'll have to separate these this is a different if L if El letter and this particular thing is different so only one out of this will be selected and only one out of this will be selected a is equal to 30 a is greater than four so this will be selected but now the control will not jump out out of all these statements because this if lfl ladder is independent of this particular if lfl letter I hope I'm making sense and I'm making it clear for you so this will be executed and one out of this and this will be executed since 30 is greater than two print a is greater than two will be selected and a is greater than two will be printed on the screen so let me run this and show this to you a is greater than 4 is printed and a is greater than 2 is is also printed so let's come back to the notes and see how these things are written there I have written all the notes in A Very Organized manner it'll be very easy for you to follow so let me read out the quiz uh write a program to print yes when the age entered by the user is greater than or equal to 18 so you can simply solve this quiz let me solve this quiz for you and things will get even more clearer after you solve this quiz so I'll say quiz. py so I'll say a AG is equal to int uh int of input of enter your age okay so let me delete this I don't want to see this and then what I'll do is I'll say if age is greater than 89 print you cannot drive okay else I'll say print and then I'll say please dve okay so let me see what the original question was write a program to print yes when the age entered by the user is greater than or equal to 18 so I'll change it I'll say if it's greater than or equal to 18 then print yes so otherwise print no okay so let's run this code now and let's see if it works so enter your age 67 yes it's greater than equal to 18 I should say 18 and by the way I'm using this jellyfish theme and I'm using font likees which is why I'm seeing this particular symbol it's nothing but it's greater than equal to it's two characters not a single character so mind that I'll run this code and once again I'll enter seven and you can say no what if I enter 18 what will happen if I enter 18 if I enter 18 it says yes and I can even make my code look beautiful if I you know type something like this let me run this code now uh let me never select something and run the code because if you select something it copies that selected content to a temp code Runner file and that temp code Runner file is executed so a lot of beginners gets confused even I used to get confused when I used to you know um run python using vs code code Runner extension and um accidentally I used to select some text and I used to run uh my code and what happens is all the code is copied to that temp code Runner file and that temp code Runner file is executed and it really uh confuses um the beginner so let's click somewhere and run this code and let's see if I can enter some age let me enter 19 and you can see yes is printed on the screen so this program works we have solve the quiz let's talk about relational operators what are relational operators relational operators are used to evaluate conditions inside the if statements so if I want to see if something is greater than something or not or if something is lesser than or equal to or greater than or equal to or equal to then I'll use some operators which are called relational operators and you must be familiar with all these operators so double equals to is used for equals greater than equal to is used for greater than or equal to less than equals is used for less than or equal to so we have some U some more of these operators for example less than greater than not equals to now let's talk about logical operators in Python logical operators oper on conditional statements so we we have and we have or and we have not let's look at both these operators one by one so I'll uh create a file for relational operators let me come back to my vs code I'll say 03 uncore ra relational operators dopy and let me write some code here so what I'll do is I'll simply say a is equal to True uh or let me say a is equal to 435 and I'll say B is equal to 64 and I'll say print a greater than 5 so is a greater than 5 no it's not greater than 5 so I'll expect a false here I'm sorry a is greater than 5 435 is indeed greater than 5 so true will be printed on the screen so I should expect true um now what I'll do is I'll simply say uh is B greater than or equal to 64 indeed it's greater than equal to 64 because it's actually equal to 64 so I'll expect it true but what if I say B is greater than or equal to 164 this is false so I'll expect a false here so this is how logical operators work and they'll simply make all these statements evaluate to either true or false and you can use these inside your F statement so if you have a true inside e statements what happens is that particular block will be executed if you have a false inside IFL statement then if will not be executed else will be executed so we have seen all these things in our if L if else. py program so let's come back to vs code and let me create another file for logical operators and I'm going to give all this code to you so do not worry about this logical operators. py and we are going to talk about some of the logical operators so I'll say a is equal to true and I'll say B is equal to false and I'll print a A and B what will a and b return true and false and operator will return true only if both of A and B are true is a true yes it is true B is not true so this will evaluate to false and I will expect a false uh in my output window okay so let me now print A or B so a or b or will return a true if either of A or B is true a is true B is not true so this will return true it just need one out of a or b to be true and it will return a true otherwise it will return a false so you can see that true has been printed what if I say not of a print not of a and this is going to invert a so if a is true it will become false if a is false it will become true let's see if this works and yes a is a was true and it is now false okay so I hope this makes sense so this was about relational operators and logical operators in Python so in Python logical operators operate on conditional statements so you can have a true and you can have a false and true and false can be supplied as operant to and or and not operators I hope this makes sense so uh this was about logical operators now here I have talked about Al Clause a bit and I think I have explained you Alf Clause uh Clause already uh let's talk a bit about Al if Clause so Al if in Python means else if and you should know this by this time L if in Python means else if an if statement can be chained together with a lot of these Alf statements followed by an else statement so look at this ladder if condition one then some set of instructions will be executed L if condition two some set of instructions will be executed L if condition three some set of instructions will be executed and at the end we have this else and we have a lot of code here so only one out of this letter will be executed so this letter will stop once a condition in an if or L if is met so what will happen is it will check for condition one let us say it evaluates to false it will come back here and it will say is condition two true if it is not true it will check condition three and will keep on doing with other Al if statements and once it finds something which evaluates to True let us say condition three evaluates to true it will stop the ladder and it will skip all the ALF statements along with the lse statement because only one out of all these I should say if elephant else statements will be executed only one out of these blocks will be executed so this is how Al if works so there can be any number of Alf statements and the last else is executed only if all the conditions inside Alf and if fails okay so if failed and Al if failed I mean when I say fail I mean all the conditions inside if and Al if evaluated to false so if all the conditions evaluates to false last else will be executed so one out of all these statements will always be executed you can skip else you can skip l if if there is only if then the condition will be checked and if it's true then the block will be executed otherwise it's not going to get executed so there can be any number of L if statements and only one out of these if L if else statements will be executed I hope this is clear and if not it'll definitely be clear in chapter six practice set because I have designed chapter 6 practice set in a way that will make it very easy for you to understand these things uh so we'll move on to chapter six practice set now and we'll do some practice on conditional Expressions let's move on to chapter six practice set now so here is the PDF of chapter 6 which I have put together for you and we are going to start coding some of the solutions for all these questions so here is the question question number one write a program to find greatest of phone numbers centered by the user so you have four numbers you have to find which one is the greatest and you have to print it and show it to the user so what I'm going to be doing is I will create a file this is the fifth program so I'll say 05 uncore and I will say PR and then I'll saycore 01 py and what I'll do is I'll simply say a is equal to 45 B is equal 6 and then I'll say C is equal to 86 and we have another number D is equal to 23 these are the four numbers now what we'll do is we will find out the greatest of these four numbers so uh let me say if a is greater than b then do this and if a is greater than b then B is the winner or a is the winner any one of these is going to be the winner any one of these is going to be the greatest whatever is the greatest I'll set it inside Max I'll say Max num so Maxum is a number and uh I'll say a is the max number if a is greater than b if a is greater than b maximum is a else Maxum is what maximum is B so we have greatest of A and B in a very similar way I'll find greatest of c and d and I'll have another maximum so let me call this maximum 1 and let me call it maximum 2 and let me replace a by C and B by D so we have a c we have a d we have maximum one we have maximum 2 maximum one is greatest of A and B maximum 2 is greatest of c and d and now we have to find out which is the greatest of the four numbers and the greatest of four numbers will be the max of Maxum and Max two so whichever is the greatest out of Max num and Max 2 who will be the winner so what I'll do is I'll say if Max num one or Maxum 2 is greater than Maxum 1 I'll say Maxum is equal to what it will be Maxum 2 otherwise Maxum is equal to maximum one so I'll say Maxum is going to be maximum one so let me say Maxum one and let me save this and now what I'll do is I'll simply print my maximum and I'll say maximum number out of these four numbers is what we'll print it whatever it is okay so we'll say Maxum so maximum is the maximum of all these four numbers let's run this program and see if it works and maximum of the four numbers is 86 which is indeed true let me make it 457 and let me see if uh the output changes to 457 and yes it indeed changed to 4557 which means the program works and it works great so let's now move move on to the next question which is wrer program to find out whether a student is pass or fail if it requires 40% and at least 30% in each subject to pass so let us say you have four subjects you need 30% at the very least to pass each subject and you need overall 40% to pass so assume there are three subjects and take marks as an input from the user so while you are taking input from the user you need to ensure sure that you are taking an integer you are not taking a string if you take string then you'll be in trouble so this is something you need to remember while solving problems U like this okay so let's solve this problem let's solve problem number two and we'll gain some confidence after solving this so let me create a new file it's a six program and second question so this is how I'm going to name the file and what I'll do is I'll say uh M1 is equal to int of input and I'll say enter the marks for subject one okay and I'm going to repeat it for um M2 and M3 so M2 and M3 are marks for subject two and subject 3 respectively so let me now uh see what is the overall percentage so I'll say overall is equal to M1 + M2 + M3 divided by what divided by 3 this is going to be the average of uh M1 M2 and M3 and If I multiply this by 100 what I'm going to get is I'm going to get the overall percentage so this is the overall percentage now what I'll do is I'll check whether the overall percentage is greater than 40 uh I'll say if overall is greater than or equal to 40 uh then you are pass then we'll say print uh you are pass you have passed okay you have passed the exam otherwise what I'll do is I'll simply say that if the overall percentage is not greater than equal to 40 then you have not passed okay uh so I'll say print you have not passed so let me print this so I'll say uh you have not passed but wait a second wait a second what if the individual percentages uh which is M1 M2 and M3 are not greater than or equal to 33 what if this kind of case occurs then you are not passed so what I'll do is I'll check M1 if m1 is greater than or equal to 33 and M2 is greater than equal to 33 and M3 is greater than or equal to 33 if this is the case what I'll do is and let me not multiply this by 100 because uh M1 M2 and M3 are out of 100 so we don't have to multiply it by 100 okay so M1 is should be greater than equal to 33 M2 and M3 should also be greater than equal to 30 33 and all of these conditions should evaluate to true if all of these conditions evaluate to true then I'll say you are passed otherwise you are not passed so you are you have passed the exam otherwise you have failed the exam okay so I can merge these two if statements or let me make it simple um when I say simple I mean it will be easier for you to write this so we are checking for the overall greater than equal to 40 percentage if that's the case what we are doing is we are checking the individual marks for M1 M2 and M3 for all these three subjects so M1 can be maths M2 can be physics M3 can be chemistry and we are simply taking the marks uh individual marks of all the subjects and if the individual marks are greater than equal to 33 you will pass the exam otherwise you'll not pass the exam so let me run this program and see if it works so what I'll do is I'll say 33 is my marks for subject 1 33 is my marks for subject 2 and 33 is my marks for subject 3 and I have not passed the exam because overall percentage is not greater than equal to 40 now what I'll do is I'll say my marks for subject 1 is 32 marks for subject 2 is 100 and marks for subject 3 is 99 and again I have not passed the exam and let me also give the reason here why I have not passed the exam due to one of the subjects and here what I'll do is I'll say due to overall percentage so your overall percentage is not greater than equal to 40 which is why you have not passed the exam let me run this program once again and uh I'll say my marks for subject number one is 33 subject two is uh let us say 23 and subject 3 is 100 okay so if I run this then you have not passed the exam due to one of the subjects so you have not passed the exam due to subject two okay let me run this program once again and let me show you what if the person is passed you have passed the exam so this is how this works really very simple and straightforward you took the marks of individual subject from the user as an input you calculated the overall percentage and now after the overall percentage is calculated you are simply comparing that overall percentage with 40 if it's greater than equal to 40 then you are saying okay let me check some other factors If the percentage is greater than or equal to 40 you are not saying that the person is passed you'll check individual marks you'll check for the individual marks being greater than equal to 33 and once they are greater than or equal to 33 you are saying okay you have passed the exam otherwise you have not passed the exam due to one of the subjects so you are not passed in some of the subjects okay or one of the subjects so this is how this program is working I hope I explained you the problem number two in great detail so now let's move on to problem number three and it'll be easier for you to solve if you have uh listened each and everything that I Told You So Far So a Spam comment is defined as a text containing the following words so make a lot of money if if some text contains make a lot of money uh Gmail might decide to mark that email as spam or Outlook might Define that email as spam if somebody says buy now so people use these kinds of terms to um to create spake emails to create spam emails and um get some traffic on their website which doesn't add actual value or they might say sub subscribe this or they might say click this so we need to write a program to detect these spams now I'm not saying that the emails or the text which contain all these text uh all these uh strings are actual spams but some spam system might need to detect such kind of words or set of words and then run some other checks on those words so we have to create a program which can actually detect all these things so let's move on to visual studio code and create a file 07 uncore and let me call it pr03 py because this the problem number three so what I'll do is I'll say spam words is equal to and I'll simply create a list of all the words which I think is a spam so let me start writing here I'll say by now and then we have some other words as well I I'll take another one or subscribe this or it might be uh it might be click this okay so I'll take three of these you can add even more and the program will work now what I'll do is I'll detect for all these words in a given string so I'll say email is equal to and I'll say this is a nice stock you need to click this and buy this stock okay so this contains click this so what I'll do is I'll simply detect what I'll do is I'll say uh if word in email spam is equal to True okay and then I'll say print uh spam is Spam now what is this word you might ask me what is this word so we'll have to take each and every word out of these list so what I'll do is I'll simply say if by now in email then spam is true if subscribe this in email then the spam is true and if click this is inside my email then spam is true now if the number of words in this list are a lot then it will be tedious for you to write this and we learn in the loops chapter how we'll solve this problem this is an actual problem so we are finding it very difficult to type all these words individually so we'll use fall loops in the later chapters but for now this will work so let me run this program and you can say spam is true but how do you know that spam is true for an incoming email so let me modify this program and instead of saying that this is the email let me say email is equal to input e enter your email so so you have the liberty of entering the email and initially I'll say spam is false okay so initially spam is false and if any one of these if statements executes my spam will become true okay so let's run this program and I'll click on run code and it says enter your email I'll say this is Bob how add you make and spam is false for sure I'll say hey mck please click this and this is Spam I might also say uh hey please buy now okay I I can say this item is great hey please buy now spam is true because it contains buy now now I want to ask you a question and you need to comment below and answer this question so I I need the TW engagement okay I don't want you to just listen I want you to answer as well so what if I type buy now and I press enter type in the comments below with the time stamp whether this will print spam is true or spam is false I need everybody's comments come on let the comments coming uh by now will it be true or will it be false if you guessed it right it'll be false why false because we are not taking this case sensitivity into account we are not checking for each and every combination of lowercase and uppercase characters so how do we solve this we can solve this by simply making both of these as lowercase so when we are iterating this spam words we can make each and every word lowercase and we can simply make a email as lowercase so this will be lowercase this is indeed lower case so we can simply make a email lower case so what I'll do is I'll say uh dot lower okay so this will make it lowercase and now if I type uh let me run this program once again and now if I type by now you can say spam is true because I have converted by input email into lowercase things so this is how you solve rear word problems you you'll not always get the solution on the Internet or get somebody to tell you the solution you'll have to use your brain and figure out such kind of solutions okay so I hope this was helpful let's move on to the next problem um which is write a program to find whether a given username contains less than 10 characters or not and this is going to be very easy so I want you to solve this problem what you'll do is you'll simply say username is equal to something and then what you'll do is you'll run the l n which is a len function to find out the length of the string it'll give you the number of characters in a string and just compare it with 10 if it's greater than 10 then you can tell that it's greater than 10 otherwise you can simply say it's not greater than 10 so this is how this uh Works let's move on to the next question now write a program which finds out whether a given name is is present in a list or not and if you want to find out whether a given name is present in a list or not all you need to do is use the in operator so let me show you how this works so this is problem number uh five so I'll simply say 08 uncore p04p and I'll say word is equal to Harry and I have already shown you this here but once again let me solve this problem for you very quickly I want to show you how quickly I'll solve this problem write a program which finds out whether a given name is present in the list or not so uh let me say uh name is equal to Harry and I'll say names is equal to let me have some list of names and uh let me say Mina okay so let me run this and so what I'll do is I'll say if I'll say if name in names I'll say print what print name is present else what will happen else print print what else Sprint name is not present so I'll simply fix this and let me run this program for you so name is not present why is name not present because this doesn't take a sensitivity into account I've told you once I've told you twice and I'll keep telling you many times if you make it capital h a r y this is going to um tell you that the name is present otherwise it will not tell you that the name is present if you change case sensitivity of your word or of any word in the list so if I run this program Harry is not present otherwise Harry will be present okay or if you say something like this shuby and if you run this program you'll say name is not present because sh is not present here right so this is how this works okay so now what I'll do is I'll write a program which finds out whether a name is present in a list or not we have done this uh you can write a program for calculating grade of a student from his marks from the following scheme so 90 to 100 is ex grade 80 to 90 is a grade um and 70 to 80 is B grade 60 to 70 is C grade 50 to 60 is D grade and less than 50 is f grade so you can use this scheme and you can simply create a program so all you need to do in this question is take take the number of marks into account and print the corresponding grade so it will be a very very simple F El lad I don't want to solve it for you so you can go ahead and solve this okay now let's come to question number seven write a program to find out whether a given post is talking about Harry or not so you have to detect Harry from a given string so you can simply convert Harry to lowercase convert U the string to lowercase and then compare do not compare capital h a r y to the given string convert the string to lowercase use Harry as lowercase and then compare so that you are sure that this particular thing is lowercase Harry you have entered is lowercase so both of the uh operate operant are lower case now you can use the in operator and you can find out whether small case Harry or lower case Harry is present inside the given string or not so if I were to solve this problem very very quickly what I'll do is I'll simply say zero 9 underscore and I think this is problem number um I forgot I forgot it's problem number seven so I'll press f2 to rame and it's problem number seven and py and then I'll say uh text is equal to not test text is equal to input and I'll say enter your text and once my text is entered what I'll do is I'll simply print uh Harry in text. low so this will be true if Harry is present or let me make this program a bit fancier what I'll do is I'll say if Harry in text. L then you print something then you are printing something what are you printing uh you'll say yes har is present else what you'll do else you'll you'll say Harry is not present okay so you'll say Harry is not present so let me say no Harry is not present okay so let's run this program now and enter your text if I enter my text as Harry I'll say yes Harry is present otherwise um if I say if I run this program once again if I say Rohan is a good boy Harry is not present Rohan is a good boy and a friend of ha okay so this post is not talking about Harry let me make this a bit more fancier I'll say Harry is a good boy I have changed some of the characters to uppercase and you'll see that even this works because print yes Harry is present will be printed only when Harry is compared to the lowercase version of your text so I'm comparing Harry with lowercase version of your text I hope that I am able to explain you what I wanted so this was about chapter number six practice set I hope you enjoyed it we'll now move on to chapter number seven which is really very exciting we learn about loops I hope this was helpful let's move on to chapter 7 and learn about loops now let's now move towards chapter number seven which is really a very exciting and important topic in Python which is Loops let's not talk about loops what are Loops you might have done certain task in your daily life where you are repeating something for example when you're combing your hair what you do is you repeat it take the com and you use that com on your hair more than once let me give you another example in my notes I've written sometimes we want to repeat a set of statements in our program for instance if I want to print 1 to 10,000 or th000 in Python you might not be able to do that what I mean by that is you might not be able to type print one print 2 print three all the way till 1 million or 1 billion for that matter that that that will take you very very long to type using your keyboard and that's really not efficient is there a way to make computer type more than say 10,000 numbers or 20,000 numbers can't I program my computer in such a manner that it repeatedly prints these numbers on its own let me tell you what I mean by this what I'll do is I'll open my visual studio code on this folder and we'll create a file here and I'll say 01 unor loops. py let's forget about how loops work I'm going to show you something I'll say a is equal to Z and I'll simply write something do not worry about this do not worry about what this uh V is or what these brackets are about I'll simply print something inside this V I repeat you don't have to worry about what while is and how all this works but have a look you'll see that I have printed the numbers starting from zero all the way till 99 and all of these numbers have been printed automatically I didn't type print one print 2 print three print four all the way till 99 so something is working to print from 0 to 99 and it's Loop I'll tell you how loops work so Loops make it easy for a programmer to tell the computer whether set of instructions to which set of instructions to repeat so if you want to repeat a certain set of instructions you can always do that and you can simply use Loops for that so there are different types of Loops in Python primarily there are two types of Loops in Python V loops and for Loops so while loops and for Loops have some sort of differences between them so while loops work in a certain way for loops work in a different way but they both are really very similar and we'll look into that so let's look into these Loops one by one let's start with the while loop and the syntax of while loop looks like this so I've written a while loop over here and this is while loop and how Loop works is you start from a value you keep on incrementing that value and you keep on doing something until this condition is true let me explain you once again so in my notes I have written the body of while loop so what I'm saying is while condition while the condition is true what I'm doing is I am executing the body of the loop and I'll keep on doing that until my condition becomes false and if my condition is true always then this y Loop is going to work always and that's not a good idea so what do we do we keep on updating something so that this condition eventually becomes false so what happens is you say while a is greater than say 10 or 20 so if a is greater than 10 then only this body of the loop will execute otherwise it will not execute so you can see the block keeps executing until until the condition is true so until the condition is true the block keeps executing in while Loops the condition is checked first so first you check the condition if it evaluates or true the body of the loop is executed otherwise it is not executed and now that we are talking about white Loop let's write a y loop from scratch once again so I'm going to write another program here I'm going to say V.P and what I'll do is I'll simply use I equal to 0 and I'll say while uh while I is less than say 20 and I'll say I + equal 1 plus equal to 1 so I'm updating I and I'm printing I inside this Loop so the value of I when I'm at line number one is one and the value of I is definitely less than 20 so since the value of I is less than 20 this body of the loop will execute and this Sprint I will get executed since this print I is executed this i+ equal to 1 will also be executed because we have entered the body of the loop when the condition is true we enter the body of the loop and everything inside the body will be executed so print I is executed I + equal to 1 is executed and the value of I has now been updated to 1 so it was Zero before now it is one one is still less than 20 so once again 1 is printed I + equals to 1 I is now two then once again two is printed i+ equal to 1 I is now three once again I is four then it's printed and this keeps on happening keeps on happening keeps up happening and eventually I becomes 20 and when I becomes 20 this condition is no longer true now this condition is no longer true because I is now 20 and 20 is not less than 20 and 21 is also not less than 20 so the value of I is 20 and this condition evaluates to false which results into exiting of the Y Loop so we exit the Y Loop because the condition of the Y Loop is no longer true now so this is how y Loop works so if I come back to my notes I've written the same thing if the loop is entered the process of condition check and execution is continued until the condition becomes false So eventually the condition becomes false and we exit the V loop I hope I made it clear for you people let's now solve this quiz we have to print 1 to 50 using Y Loop and this is going to be a bit tricky and why do I say that it's going to be a bit tricky because I is starting from zero I'll have to start it from one okay if I start it from one I'll have to stop it when the value of I is six and why did I write six why did I not write five because when the value of I is five I still want it to print five so I want the condition to evaluate to True when the value of I is five so this is something you need to keep in mind by the value of I is 5 5 less than 6 is going to evaluate to true but if I make this six as five 5 less than 5 will not be evaluated and 1 to 4 will only be printed on the screen but since I want one to five to be printed I'll write six if I write here five I'll have to say I is less than equal to 5 so if I say I is less than equal to 5 then definitely 1 to5 will be printed on the screen as you can see so this is how all this works I hope I'm able to explain you how all this is working now let's come back to the notes and see an example so I is equal to0 while I is less than 5 print Harry I is equal to I + 1 you can even say I + equal to 1 that that that's uh exactly the same thing so this will print Harry five times or if you want to do something else you don't have to print every time you can increment a value you can ping a server there are n number of things you can do inside while loop and it can be a bunch of statements you don't have to execute a single line you can even print 20 lines it depends on you what you want to do but every time you are doing something that something will be executed again and again until the condition evaluates to false so I hope I'm making sense here and I hope you are getting the point so I've written a note here if the condition never becomes false the loop keeps getting executed and and this is a problem and this is called an infinite Loop and we we don't want to see infinite Loops ideally okay so if you are making a mistake and that is resulting into an infinite Loop then that's a mistake but sometimes we use infinite Loops intentionally and when do we use infinite Loops intentionally when we are developing games we need a game Loop and that game Loop needs to be ran repeatedly and such kind of while Loops are not problema because we have intentionally done that but otherwise if you are making a mistake and your Loop is repeatedly executing then definitely it's a mistake and you should avoid it I'll show you an example of infinite V Loop let me create another program for you and I'll show you an example of infinite while loop so I'll say 03 uncore infinite uncore while. py okay so what I'll do here is I'll simply give you an example of infinite while loop so I'll copy this code and instead of making it I is less than equal to five I not update the condition here so I is always less than equal to 5 I is always 1 and I is always less than equal to 5 and if I run this program one will be printed repeatedly and it will keep on printing because this condition will never ever evaluate to false let me show this to you I don't want to select something before running the program so one is repeatedly being printed it's being printed it's being printed the program has not yet exited as you can see so it's printing one one one one one one and I'll have to cancel this program I don't want my computer to crash so what I'll do is I'll Simply Save it and let me open another terminal and this is still running let me delete this I'll have to delete this because I don't want my uh computer to crash for any reason because I'm recording a video and I don't want that video to get wasted so another quiz says write a program to print the content of a list using python so we have a list and we want to print the content of a list using while loop how do you do that so I'll show you you can use indexing and uh let me create a program 04 uncore V print and I'll say list. py okay I'll say a is equal to I'll uh enter some numbers and I'll enter banana and what I'll do is I'll say while I is less than length of a so a will have some length and I have not initialized I I'll initialize I with zero I'll say I is equal to zero and I'll print I'll print what I'll print AI what is ai ai ai is not artificial intelligence here AI is the value of U the list at index I okay so this list at index I okay so we have I is equal to Z I'll have to increment I i+ equal to 1 and is this program okay yes it is it looks fine because I will start from zero and it will go all the way till length of I minus one so the length of I in this case is six and I want it to go from 0 to 5 because at index 5 we have banana and this this is doing the same thing so the value of I will start from zero and eventually it will become five and five will be less than six but when it becomes six the condition will evalue it to false and it'll no longer uh run so let me run run this and you'll see 1 2 3 4 5 and banana what if I make this to as Apple let me make it apple and show you that it is printed so this is how you print content of a list using python okay let's now look into fall loops and fall Loops is another type of Loop in Python fall Loop is used to iterate through a sequence like a list tle or string you can even uh iterate strings uh so what I'll do is I'll simply write a list here but before that let me show you an example of for Loop 05 for. py as say for I in range and I'll say 34 and I'll say print I what is this range we never heard of this range function so range function will simply give you numbers from 0o to the number which you have entered here let let us call it n so it will print numbers from 0 to n minus one so if I want numbers from 0 to nus1 I'll simply say for I in range and I'll say 34 this should give me 0 to 33 in the console and it has given me the same what if I wanted to print 1 to 33 I'll simply enter that number or or let us say 10 to 33 I'll simply enter a number here I'll say I want to start from 10 and I want to go all the way till 3 33 the number 34 will not be printed if I want 34 to be printed I'll have to write 35 here okay so it's from this number till this number minus one so 10 will be printed I'll show you um 10 is printed and 11 12 13 14 it will go all the way till 33 not 34 so you need to remember this somehow that range function will include the first value but it will exclude the second value so it will go from the first value to Second value minus one okay so this is how range function Works let's close these Terminals and come back to the notes what what is what is this fall Loops can I can I iterate a list using fall Loop I'll simply write 06 uncore for iterate py and I'll use the same list I'm really very lazy believe me and I'm going to do the same thing I'm going to use the same list okay so what I'll do is instead of while I'll write a for here I'll say for I in range and I want to go from zero to Len of a minus one and this should give me U the desired output one apple 3 4 banana but there's a better way to do this I don't want to do this I want I don't want to use range function I can simply iterate this list I can simply say for item in a print item yes and it will print all the items of this list I don't have to run the Len function I don't have to run the range function I don't have to write uh so much of code to increment I every time no I don't want to do that I will simply run this code and this will give me the same output as was given by line number three four and five so I hope I'm making sense here and I hope you are learning uh fall Loops here uh let's come back to notes and let's see what I have written in the notes for you so a fall Loop is used to iterate through a sequence like list tle and string so you can even iterate a tle you can iterate a string and the syntax of a follow Loop looks like this I've written the syntax for you so in this list L you can see that we have 1 7 and 8 and once you have 17 and 8 you can print 17 and 8 on the screen using a fall Loop so I've written range function for you in the nodes the range function in Python is used to generate a sequence of numbers you can generate the sequence of numbers um from 0 to that number minus one we have already talked about range and let me tell you something I'm going to give all the programs in the description so you'll get a bundle of download it can be a zip or I'll simply zip it and I'll I'll send it to you in the description you can check out the description and in the description you'll get some link and all the programs including all these PDFs will be there so just in case if you're wondering the range function is python is used to generate a sequence of numbers we can also specify the start stop and step size so the third argument of range function is also there which is Step size and step size is usually not used with range but again if you want to use it you can use it okay so let me demonstrate this step size for you so if instead of um let me come back to this uh if instead of you know uh saying 1034 I type 10342 and I run this program you can see that every second number is being printed what does it mean it means that first 10 will be printed then one number will be skipped what if I say three then every third number will be printed okay so instead of 12 you'll see 13 so you'll see 10 13 16 so this is how the step size Works usually it's not not used but again sometimes when you use it it really comes very handy let's come back to the notes and I have demonstrated the range function here uh so all these notes will be very useful for you when you are revising something because we are just starting here we are remembering each and everything when we are starting from chapter number one and there will be a time uh after say six seven months when you you'll think about all these things and you'll forget it and you'll think that oh yes I know about range but I don't remember the syntax anymore the these notes will come in handy at that time so please take a print out of all these notes and you know keep it in your desk or somewhere uh keep it safe with you you it should be uh very accessible to you you should be able to refer it anytime now there is another concept that I want to talk about and it's really very important because it's asked in interview questions for loop with else the first question that an interviewer will ask you is can you use for loops with else you'll say no we cannot use for loops with else and we use it with if if you don't know python you will simply say this and you'll fail the test but what if I tell you that you can use an optional else with fall Loops so an optional else can be used with a fall Loop if the code is to be executed when the loop exhausts okay so let me demonstrate this to you here so if my list is 178 and I am iterating this list and I'm printing all the items in this list I want to print done when the the loop exhausts which means that when all the items inside this Loop have finished printing okay so before this I want to demonstrate break and continue so we have a break statement and we have a continu statement let me talk about break and continu statement before I talk about for loop with else okay so let me come back to um to my VSS code and I'll simply say break continue. py okay so what I'll do is I'll simply say uh I'll simply create a list first of all I'll say 1 2 3 4 5 and I think I have entered these single codes which are creating problem so what I'll do is I'll say for item in a print a I'm printing a I'm iterating a and I'm printing a and uh now what I'm doing is um sorry I'm not printing I I need to print item I need to print all the items in a and you can simply say that when I'm running this code uh 1 to 5 will be printed and no surprises there okay so what I'll do now is I'll simply say if I'll say if item is equal to three if at all you encounter a three simply break this Loop and when I say break this Loop you are not going to go to the next iteration you are going to exit this Loop okay so let me print another statement here I'll say print we have finished this Loop okay so let me run this program for you so one is printed then two is printed then three is printed and then this condition evaluates to true so break is executed so once we say break inside a fall Loop we simply say that abandon this fall Loop we are not going to execute this fall Loop and we exit that for Loop immediately so after three sprinted on the screen this for Loop will be exited and you'll see we have finished this Loop printed on the screen so that's how it works okay so we have finished this Loop will be printed what if I say if item equals to equals to 4 you'll simply run this code and you'll see that we have finished this Loop has been printed after four now we have another statement called continue statement what if in place of break I say continue now break and continue are different I'll tell you why they are different how they are different when you say break you are saying I'm not going to look at this fall Loop ever again and when you say continue you are saying that I am not going to look at this particular iteration ever again there's a difference you're not going to execute the loop anymore and you are not going to execute an iteration just a single iteration so when one is printed you are saying okay if is not true so you you you don't care two is printed nothing happens three is printed nothing happens four is printed this condition evaluates to True continue is executed so when continue is executed you are simply saying do not execute anything after this so let me change this program a bit and show you I'll simply say print um done this iteration for and I'll print item so let me show you what happens when we don't have this continue statement when this fall Loop doesn't have any a for continue or break when I do this the uh the the item is printed and then done this iteration for that item is printed item is printed done this iteration for that item is printed and this keeps on happening what if I say if continue equals if item equals to four break what happens let me show you break once again if I say break after iteration number three for iteration number four print item will be executed you can see four is printed here then I will encounter this item equals to equals to 4 break and what happens is this is going to fall get this Loop now and it will directly jump here it will print we have finished this Loop but if I say continue or or let me change it to three so I want to give you a set of different examples so that you can understand so this Sprint item is printed one will be printed done this iteration for item will be printed which means this particular thing is printed and then same happens for number two same happens for number three but for number three when it happens print item is printed without any hassles then item is equal to three yes it is equal to three break is encountered and this means that we are not going to look at this Loop anymore we are directly going to jump jump outside of this Loop and outside of this Loop we have this particular line so this is executed and you can see we have finish this Loop is printed on the screen so now let's change this to continue I want to continue and if I say continue I'm simply saying that I want to stop right here and continue the next iteration let me show you what it means when I run this code it will run for one it will run for two it will run for three as well let me run it once again it will run for one it will run for two it will run for three but while it is running for three this is printed and when the control comes here what python says is we have a continue here we cannot go below this line let's continue the next iteration for four so it will continue for four without printing the lines after continue So when you say continue you simply saying that stop this particular iteration right here and execute the next iteration I hope I'm making sense here so it will run normally for the iteration number four it will run normally for iteration number five and even if we have iteration number 6 7 8 9 10 will keep on running without any hassles because this continue is encountered only when the value of item is equal to three I hope I'm able to explain break and continue now let's talk about for loop with else okay so I'll create another program here I'll say before else. py and what I'll do is I'll copy all these lines here and I'll simply say else and I'll say print and we'll say V are inside else okay and uh let me run this program for you and you can see we are insight else is printed so whenever this Loop is completed successfully then this VR inside the CSUS print what if I have a break here I'll show you something if I have a break here you can see that we are inside else is not printed so else is printed I mean the lines inside the else are executed only when the loop is completed or finished successfully so what it means is let me come back to the notes and show you only if the fall Loop runs for item number one seven and eight then only you will see done done will be printed when the loop normally exhausts done will not be printed if you are breaking the loop in between so if you are breaking the loop in between else will not be executed and if you're not breaking the loop in between else will be executed so all the iterations need to be executed and the loop should exhaust normally and if the loop exhausts normally you will see the code inside else being printed or executed okay so this is how for loom with else Works let's not talk about brake statement we have already talked about brake statement but let me um let me tell you once again breake is used to come out of the loop when encountered so whenever you encounter a breake statement it simply says come out of the loop and never ever look at this loop again so it will instruct the program to exit the loop immediately now so right away the loop will be executed and this particular Loop will only print 0 1 2 and three because at three this will see a break and break means that we are not going to deal with this Loop anymore okay coming back to the Contin statement continous statement is used when uh you want to stop the current iteration of the loop and continue with the next iteration it will instruct the program to skip this particular iteration and when I say iteration uh let me tell you what iteration means when I'm iterating this Loop when I'm traversing this sorry when I'm itating this list when I'm traversing this list number one is an iteration number seven is an iteration eight is an iteration when I was iterating this particular list let me show you one is an iteration then another iteration will be for Apple another will be for three then for four five and then for banana so this Loop will have iterations the number of time this Loop runs means that we are running different iterations okay coming back to the notes I will uh say this is printed when the loop exhausts when the loop exhaust this is printed coming back to the brake statement you know how break works and you know how continue works now okay so here here is an example of continue statement I have already already told you about continue so you can look into this example and um we'll look into more examples and practice it but let's not talk about past statement what is pass so pass is a null statement in Python what is what is what is this null statement it will instruct the python to do nothing what if you want to do something inside loop and you want to do it later you just want to write something and you want to you don't want it to throw an error so I'll show you something let us write this program 09 uncore pass. py oops so I need to rename this F2 to rame py okay and what I'll do is I'll simply say that um for I in a okay or or or let me let me say range I don't want to create a here and and I have no idea what I want to do here what I'm saying to myself is I'll write this Loop I'll finish this Loop later but let me print something or rather I'll say let me do something you can see that we have an error and this error says uh expected indented block so this this is throwing an error it's simply saying that what do you want to do here why do we have a colon here why do we have this for Loop here when you are not writing inside this Loop so I can simply say pass and this will not throw an error and I can execute this program without any hassles now if I don't have this pass this will simply throw an error you can see this is a red colored uh file name and this simply says inition error so you need to write this pass to get rid of this um to get rid of this error okay so we now have an error free program so pass is just an statement without which a program with an empty Loop will throw an error so if you have an empty Loop it will throw an error but if you write pass it will not throw an error pass can also be used inside empty functions empty classes but we'll deal with classes and function later so this was about loops we have finished our chapter number seven I hope you enjoyed let's now move on to chapter 7 practice and practice some questions so let's now talk about chapter 7 practice set and we are going to start with these questions so the question number one says write a program to print multiplication table of a given number using follow loops and this is really very straightforward so 10or pr01 py my problem number one okay okay and uh what I'll do is I'll say I is equal to 10 and I need to use for Loops okay so I'll say for I in range 10 and I'll say print and then I'll print something like this and I'm going to use f strings uh so in F strings you simply have an F here and you can use variables in curly braces like this so I'll say I + 1 because remember that I is starting from zero so I need to write I I + 1 so it will start from I + 1 and it will end at 9 + 1 which is 10 so I'll say I + 1 multiply by um or rather I should say something like this I should use this num here so I'll say num and multiply by I + 1 is equal to what I'll say numar I + 1 okay so this this is how we write a program which prints multiplication table of 10 if you want to print a multiplication table of five or say any number for that matter all you need to do is just do something like this uh enter the number and all you need to do is say back sln and you run the code and I think I have made some mistake here um what's the mistake I don't think I have any mistakes so I just have to say eight and we have the table of eight here you can even say 15 and you will have the table of 15 here now many students they don't um they don't remember the table of 19 18 17 13 14 15 so you can use this program okay so let me come back to the next question and uh write a program to greet all the person names stored in a list L1 which starts with s so we have to greet the people we have to say good morning soam good morning sain so what I'll do is I'll create a program 11 pr02 so this is going to be um this is going to be the next program that we are going to write so I'll say Shivam and then we'll say soam and uh I'm digging an arbitrary list here we have something else given in the question but let me take an arbitrary list here so I'll say Shivam so Harry and let me say Deepa okay so what I'll do is I'll say for item in L1 if L1 dot starts with starts with if item dot start starts with sorry so I want to do it for every item in L1 so if item dot starts with if it starts with s then what I want to do is I want to print that item otherwise I don't don't want to print that item so I'll say greet item sorry good morning so you don't say greet Harry great Shivam you say good morning Harry good morning soam good morning Shivam so we'll simply say print good morning and then item and if I run you'll see good morning item oops I made a mistake I need to write F string here now if I run this you'll see good morning sham why didn't we see good morning soam uh why didn't we see good morning say if I add something else let me say suchin why didn't we see good morning suchin here we we just saw good morning Shivam here the reason is that Shivam starts with this small case s and soam starts with this capital S so if if you write capital S you will have soam and sain and Shivam will not be there so if I run this code you'll see good morning soam good morning Sachin and that's all that's how it works now attempt problem number one using while loops and this is really very straightforward converting a program which is written in Fall Loop into while loop is very easy and should be straightforward for you at this point so all you need to do is simply start using V loops and simply say V something and you can use list indices uh or you can use anything you want I mean there are a lot of things that can be used to work with v Loops or a program written in V Loop can be converted to a program which is written in Fall loops okay so this is how this works okay write a program to find whether a given number is prime or not and this is very easy so you'll have to check whether this number is divided by itself and one so there should not be any other number that divides this number let's write this program and this is going to be interesting and this is asked very frequently in interviews so I'll say pr04 if I'm not wrong uh is it problem number four uh yes it is problem number four so what I'll do is I'll say num is equal to let us say six and I want to check whether this is a prime number or not so what I'll do is I'll say for I in range and I'll say six and I in range six I in range six and I want to five uh I want to find a number which divides this number okay so what I'll do is I'll start with two I'll start from two because one will definitely divide this number um and uh what I'll do is I'll say if I I percent num or rather I should say num percent I is equal to equal to Z and what does it mean when I say n% I equal to equal to Z I'm saying when I divides this number the remainder is zero if this happens if this happens this is not a prime number I'll say print not prime not Prime and we are going to break out of this Loop okay else we'll say print and we'll say this is Prime and we'll not use else with this if we'll use else with this for and I should write num here not six so I want to check whether uh I divides the number or not and I want to do this starting from two to num now we can do this still root num as well but I'll will not go into those details we'll simply make this program run and we'll move ahead so six is not prime we all know that 13 is prime let's see if this particular program declares 13 as a prime number yes this is prime let's see if declares two as a prime number I I just I'm just curious if it is able to uh detect 2 S Prime is it able to detect 3 S Prime let's see and yes this is prime it works so if I say nine it should not be prime so not prime so how this program works let's talk talk about it for I in range two to num I'm starting from Two and I'm going all the way till num my - 1 and I'm checking whether there exist a number which can divide num which can divide this number is there any number starting from 2 to 9 which can divide 9 okay so we'll we'll check two we'll check 3 4 5 6 7 and 8 will not check N9 because nine will for sure divide so if this Loop is able to run all the way till the end we can declare this number as Prime because we are not able to find a number which can divide num okay so I hope that makes sense so else will only execute when this W Loop has ran all the way till the end and if this for Loop was broken by this break statement this means that this is not a prime number and this else will not run okay I hope that makes sense I hope you understood why this program works okay moving to the next question write a program to find the sum of first and natural numbers using while loop and this is very easy let let me attempt it for you so p 05. py and we'll say while I is less than n and let us say we want to uh add we'll say some plus equals to I okay uh let me read the question once again it says write a program to find the sum of first and natural numbers using while loop so I'll start from one because natural number starts from one so I'll start from one I'll keep on adding n and I'll I'll include n so while I is less than equal to n and we'll add I to sum we'll initialize sum to zero and we'll also increment I because we want to add the numbers so at the end what I'll do is I'll simply print the sum of first n and let me use f strings here so if I write an F here and if I use this curly braces I can actually print this as a variable okay so I'll simply say the sum of first [Applause] n natural numbers is and I'll say sum okay so this is how this works so we have n we have F uh what is n we we don't have n initialized so let's find the sum of all three natural numbers let me run this code the sum of first three natural numbers are 6 1 + 2 + 3 is 6 now if I if I make it four I should get 10 because 6 + 4 is 10 let's see if it prints 10 yes it prints 10 so this is how we use while Loops to print some of first 10 natural numbers okay so this is how this is going to work okay write a program to print the following star pattern and this star pattern is very easy all right so let me be really honest with you and I'm going to explain how to print star patterns in a really very easy manner so whenever some star patterns comes in front of me what I usually do is I simply try to analyze it and I try to relate that star pattern to the mathematics of it so let me explain it to you what it means so let's say this is a star pattern for n is equal to say n is equal to 4 so for n is equal to 4 there will be four rows in this star pattern and this is also called as a pyramid pattern so if I draw this pattern you'll see this pattern and you might think how do I print this pattern oh yes I know that you can manually print all these Styles and spaces but whenever you look at this pattern the first thing that should come to your mind is that I have to print certain number of spaces then a star and then certain number of spaces so that star is also variable here we have one star then here we have two stars sorry three stars then five and then seven so what you can do is you can create a grid around this let me show you how how so what I'll do is I'll start creating a straight line something like this okay and I just want to explain this to you in a very very easy manner so let me draw all these grid lines very carefully so let us say we have rows and we have columns okay when I look at the start patteron now I can see that I have three spaces 1 2 and three one star and then three spaces let us consider this as well so I think I have made some mistake there should be one more star here and once again three spaces then two spaces then three stars and then two spaces I'm talking about this row I already talked about this row now I'll talk about this row here we have one space and and we have five stars and we have one space then we have zero spaces we have seven stars and then we have zero spaces so did you see the Symmetry here are you able to now see how easy this problem is so all you need to do is you need to create a few fall loops and you'll be able to solve this problem so now what I'll do is I'll simply try to start my outer fall Loop so so what I'll do is let me change the color I'll simply say for I'll say I should go from I'll start I from one I'll go all the way till n minus one so when I'm writing n minus one this is not python for Loop I'm simply saying go from one and include n minus one as well but if you use range function in Python you'll have to write n to go from 1 to n minus one so this is my outer for Loop now what I'll do is outside this for Loop the I will go from 1 to n minus 1 the value of I it will be 1 for n is equal to 4 it'll be 1 2 and 3 so we need to run I from 1 2 and three so this is the value of I till which I need to go now if you look at this pattern carefully I need to start another for Loop so what I'll do is I'll simply say for J goes from how many spaces should I print I need to print n minus I spaces I'll simply say I'll go from Z 0 to n minus I and I need to i- one rather because I need to print n minus I spaces and this will varant n minus I spaces and that's what I want n is four I is 1 so three spaces then in the next iteration n will be four I will be two then two spaces and I'll be able to print the spaces as per my pattern so n minus I spaces then how many stars I'll start from 1 and and go all the way till 7 for n is equal to 4 so what I'll do is I have the value of i as 1 here a value of i as 2 here 3 and four so for value of one I need to generate one for value of two I need to generate three for value of three I need to generate five so how do I do that 2 * i - 1 so I'll simply say 4 K goes from 0 to and simply what I'll do is I want this particular Loop to go from zero uh to 2 into i - 1 so I'll say 2 into I -1 and another minus one because you know I need to print 2 into I -1 spaces and while I'll code it in Python you will understand please don't get confused with an extra minus one here two star i-1 spaces so so K will go from 0 to 2 i - 2 but I'm printing these many spaces these many stars sorry so I made a mistake here I need to print these many stars not spaces so I'll simply grab my pen and write Stars here and then once again I'll repeat this particular Loop here so I'll simply write once again for L goes from 0 to nus i- one and what I'll do is I'll print n minus I spaces once again so I'll say n minus I spaces so we have this blueprint we'll use this picture and we'll now generate the the code and generating the code is really very simple once you understand how the Dynamics of these things are working but I want to tell you another star pattern that we have in the question and for that star pattern I'm going to explain you how things are working so that star pattern is also very important then we'll go to the computer screen and we'll we'll simply try to you know find out how we can use that uh logic to print the star pattern that we want so this is a star pattern and this is for n is equal 3 and this is question number N9 in the practice set and what I'll do is I'll simply Mark I is equal 0 I is equal to 1 I is my row and I is equal to 2 and then J is equal to 0 J is equal to 1 and J is equal 2 so these are the things that I'm marking here now what I'll do is I'll simply write some logic so for 0 0 I get a star for 01 I get a star for 02 I should print a star then once again for 1 Z I need to print a star then for one two I need to print a star and then for two I need to print a star for 21 I need to print a star and for 22 I need to print a star do you see any relation between I and J such that we have stars only when these values are printed so what we'll do is we'll simply say that when I is zero and J is zero we print start when I is Zer J is one we BR star when I is z J is 2 we PR star you can clearly see that at the boundaries so if I try to draw a boundary at the boundaries we are printing the star and how do we Define a boundary in mathematical terms either I is Zer or I is I is n minus one or J is zero or J is n minus one so whenever this condition meets we are in in the boundary and otherwise other than these values we are not in the boundary so this is something that you can use so either I is zero or J is zero or I is n minus one and J is n minus one so you'll end up in the boundary and you can print the star for these conditions and this is how you can solve the star pattern in problem number nine okay so I hope that this star pattern thing is very clear so all you need to do is draw grid Mark the values of I and J's and simply build Logic on top of that try to come up with something which can print your desired star pattern I hope I explained this to you pretty well and uh now what we can do is we can simply go back to the vs code and after going back to the VSS code we can simply look into these problems and solve these problems by writing the logic that we have generated so we'll first use this particular logic that we generated and then we'll use this particular logic that we generated to print the desired star pattern let's go back to a python and start writing these programs so I'll come back to this problem and start solving this problem which is problem number seven and all I'll do is I'll simply create a program foror pr07 so p07 dopy and the question is straightforward now I'll simply say n is equal to int input and I'll simply say enter a number and then I'll simply close this and I'll simply start my fall Loop so I'm using GitHub copilot which is giving me automatic suggestions I'll deactivate this because maybe you are not uh using GitHub copilot and you might think that how I'm writing all these codes so I'll start my loop from 1 to n minus one so I want to start my loop from 1 to n minus one and what I want to do is as for the logic I'll say for J in range I want my J to go from uh or rather I want to print n - I spaces is something that I should say so if I start printing n minus I spaces uh I can do this so I'll simply print a space and I'll say end is equal to blank and why am I writing this end is equal to blank because um I don't want a new line to be printed after my print statement I'm copying this fall loop three times so for the first fall Loop I'm printing n minus I spaces for the last fall Loop I'm printing n minus I spaces and between that what I'll do is I have to print 2 * by IUS one spaces so I'll simply write that 2 * IUS one spaces and I is starting from one and this is something that you need to keep in your mind that I starting from one uh now what I'll do is after these spaces and stars are printed I need a new line and I need a single new line so if you write something like this will it will this print a new line no this will print two new lines why because I have not written n is equal to I should write something like this n is equal to blank so if you do this and you run this program I think this should give you the desired pattern for n is equal to 3 we get this so for n is equal to 4 we get this so there is a problem here so when the value of n is uh say four we are getting only three rows so if you start your I from say zero or rather if you take your I from 1 to n + 1 you'll get an additional row and that will solve the problem so for four rows you can say uh n is equal to 4 for a single row you can say n is equal to 1 and for two rows you can say n is equal to two and your star pattern is printed and this problem was definitely very very easy now problem number eight is super simple all you need to do is you need to print the star pattern so for the first row print one star for the second row print two stars for the third row print Three Star this is very simple you don't have to generate any logic for this but for problem number nine we have already generated a logic and the logic was either the value of I is 0 or n minus1 or J is 0 or n minus1 so let's quickly solve problem number 9 I'll simply say 15or pr09 py and let me tell you something that these problems are going to get more simple for you once you practice you might think how many problems will I remember and do I need to remember all this but the reality is there are only five to seven such problems at a very high level and once you solve all those problems let me tell you that your life is going to be really very simple when when it comes to these problems okay so let me write this um Loop so I'll say for I in range n for J in range n so what I'm doing is I'm saying start a loop start a Outer Loop and take I from 0 to n minus1 take J from 0 to n minus one and now what I'll do is I'll simply say if I is zero or J is Zer or I is n minus one or J is n minus one you simply print a star that's all I want from you I'll say simply print a star otherwise what you do is you print a space so simply print a star else else okay so I need to put a space here I think I have messed up the indentation Okay so so I'll simply print a space here and do not forget to put end is equal to do not forget to put this okay so we'll put end is equal to blank later so after you you are done printing uh which means that you have printed the row print a new line so after my first for Loop I'll simply say print back sln and once I do this I'll press alt and I'll use multic cursor functionality from vs code I'll simply say end is equal to blank and I'll simply hardcode the value of n I'll say n is equal to say five let's try to run this program so you can see that for n is equal to 5 we have this pattern let's try for n is equal to 4 for n is equal to 4 we have this pattern so we are able to print this pattern for the values of n so we have to do this for n is equal to 3 so the question says n is equal to 3 so let's run it for n is equal to 3 as well and yes it prints the pattern okay I hope you are able to solve this problem uh now the next problem says that write a program to print multiplication table of and using for Loop in reversed order and if you want to print multiplication table in revers order what what what can you do let's see what we can do so I'll say PR uh I think it was 11. py I don't know I'll fix it it's 10. py sorry so I need to press f2 to rename in Windows and I think it's um yeah I'm sure it's enter in Mac if you want to rename okay now what I'll do is I will try to write the logic for reversed follow so I'll say for J in range um I'll say for J in range um so we have to print multiplication table of n in reverse order so I'll simply take the value of n so let us say n is equal to 10 okay so I'll start J from 1 to 11 okay so I say n+ 1 okay so I'll uh I'll start J from 1 to 10 so I want J to be 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 and 10 which is why I'm writing n+ 1 but this will give me 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 so what I'll do is I'll generate another I I'll say I is equal to n minus J so if I do n minus J which is 10 - 1 it will be 9 so I'll have to do plus 1 to generate 10 9 8 7 6 543 3 2 1 let me show you something if I print I as it is you'll see that 10 9 8 75 4 3 2 1 is being printed so this is the reverse order of numbers that I've have generated now what I'll do is instead of printing this I'll simply generate an F string and I'll say uh I multip by or rather n multip by I is equal to and I'll put this value so I'll say n multip by I and once I do that and run this you can see that we have generated the multiplication table of 10 in reverse order and you can put int input to take the value of n from the user so 4 * 4 is equal to 16 4 3 2 1 okay so I've made a mistake here so I should not say n rather I should say 11 so I I need to hardcode this and even for I I need to hardcode this because I need I don't want to start it from this end I want to start it from 10 itself so I'll say 11 minus I because initially I will be one so I'll simply say in 11 minus 10 and this will simplify the logic and let's see if everything works fine yes it works fine let's try for eight and yes it works fine so this is how you generate multiplication table of a number in reversed order I hope you enjoyed this practice set I hope you learn a lot new by using these star patterns and these star patterns are going to be the same in all the programming languages so if you have done it in Python writing it in C or writing it in Java or C++ is not going to be a very difficult task for you let's move on to chapter 8 now and Explore More on python so now we are going to talk about chapter number eight which is functions and recursions so what is a function if I ask you a function is a group of statements performing a specific task so let us say we have some statements in Python and we want want to group them together for example let us say I have a program and I want to add five numbers over and over again in a single program what is a good deal should I write that particular function as a separate inti and then keep on using that logic or should I repeat the logic again and again one of the programming practices and I would say one of the best programming practices is to use dry principle and what is the dry principle dry principle clearly states that do not repeat yourself so if you're writing a code dry principle says that you should not repeat something again and again and again do not repeat yourself so every piece of knowledge must have a single unambiguous authorative representative uh representation in the system so this is what is the basic idea of writing functions and recursion is a function calling itself but I'll make it easy for you do not worry about what recursion is at this point point so when a program gets bigger in size and its complexity grows it gets difficult for a programmer to keep track on what piece of code is doing what for example if your program has 23 lines of code there's a high chance that you will understand it there's a high chance that you might not need comments in that particular program but as the program grows bigger and bigger in size what happens is you will need you will need some comments to make sure that whoever is is reading your program understands your program and also you will need uh some sort of logic separation I would say and such kind of logic separation is provided by functions let me explain it to you once again so a function can be reused by the programmer in a given program any number of times I forgot to write times here so my bad uh so it can be used by a programmer in a given program any number of times so this is an example and syntax of a function so the the syntax of a function looks something like this you write def def is a reserved keyword in Python and Funk one is the name of the function it can be anything it can be funu it can be Harry it can be anything and you use these parentheses these opening closing parenthesis then a colon and then you simply say print hello this function can be called any number of times anywhere in the program so if you have a program you can actually use this particular function any number of times let's see an example because this way we are not going to understand it if we don't write some code so let me open this particular folder in vs code and let me create a program 01 funk. py so funk. py is a program which demonstrate what a function is so I'll simply use Funk one and what I'll do is I'll say print hello Harry and then what I'll do is uh let me close this get up cile print hello Harry and what I'll do is I'll simply say print you are good okay so this is how I want to write it so let me close this also let me save this code and what I'll do is I'll simply say funk one here and once I say funk one and once I run this code you can see hello Harry you are good has been printed here now let let's assume that I want to call this function 10 times and or let us say I want to call this function five times will I be able to do that yes definitely I'll be able to do that I'll simply write it five times and you'll see all this happening five times so instead of repeating these two lines five times which would have been 10 lines I'm actually writing fun one five times if that doesn't make it clear what I'll do is I'll simply say print I am another line okay and so we have three lines inside the function and once we call the function three lines are executed and if I call this function five times 5 * by 3 which is 15 uh 15 statements will be executed so what happens is I should see 15 lines printed on the console if I run this program and if I run this program you can see uh oops I didn't save this program it seems uh I am in another line it says in line number one you have uh okay so let me run this again again and it works fine so when you select some piece of code and you try to run it it actually creates a temp code Runner file and it tries to execute it for you if you have code Runner extension installed so make sure that you do not select anything before running any python code if you're using Code Runner extension so I hope this makes it clear what a function is can you pass an argument to a function can you pass a value to a function definitely you can and I'll show you how you can do that so this function can be called any number of time anywhere in the program and it is very easy to use now what is a function call what does it mean when somebody says I'm calling a function so when I say that I'm calling a function uh I mean that I'm actually executing the lines of code which is written inside the body of the function so whenever we want to call a function we put the name of the function followed by parenthesis as follows so what we do is we say funk one and this is called function call so this is a function call this is a function call this is a function call and these two are also a function call so I hope this makes sense the function definition what exactly is a function definition function definition is the part containing the exact set of instructions which are executed during the function call so in this case what is the function definition the selected lines of code is a function definition so these three statements line number two line number three line number four these are function definition so I hope that makes sense now a quick quiz for you write a program to greet a user with good day using functions and this is super simple all you have to do is you have to write a function uh named good day make sure that your function name should not have spaces so you can do something like this but you cannot do something like this you cannot have spaces between your functions I'll revert it back to fun one um I hope that you understood how to write functions now there are two types of functions in Python um there are buil-in functions and then we have user defined functions these buil-in functions are already present in Python and these user defined function are defined by the user so examples of buil-in function includes a len and then we have print then we have range we have already seen range when we were talking about loops you can do something like this let me uh let me create another file and I'll say say user or rather builtin functions do py and what I'll do is I'll try to use them so print is a built-in function I am a builtin function called print so print is definitely a built-in function uh we have another function which is buil-in which is range function so I can do something like this I can say for I in range three print I and what it'll do is it will print zero one and two for me so when I say for I in range three I goes from 0 to two so let me run it for you and you'll see 0 1 and two okay and this uh particular line is executed because I have this print statement here so print is a buil-in function I never Define this function range is a built-in function I myself never defined this function and then we have a lot of other functions which are built in Len is another function if you remember we had our list we have our strings and we actually ran this Len function function and this Len function was able to find out what the length of a particular object is and this is actually a buil-in function because I never defined it you never defined it it was already provided by python so these were the examples of some buil-in functions now the funk one function we Define if you look here is an example of user defined function because we actually defined it using the def keyword now let's talk about functions with arguments what are functions with arguments a function can accept some values it can work with we can put these values in a parenthesis a function can also return values as shown below so let me explain you with the help of an analogy let us say greed is a function uh let us say you are working in a store you are working in a store and somebody which is a who is a customer he handed over you uh 2,000 Rupees let us say now you have this 2,000 Rupees you took those 2,000 Rupees went inside the counter processed the order and you came back with the goods that that particular customer wanted so if you are working in a garment store uh a person might tell you that this is 2,000 Rupees and I want an amazing t-shirt and you can go inside the Garment store you can get that t-shirt for that person and you can return that t-shirt back to that customer because he has given the 2,000 Rupees to you let me explain in a very similar manner what happens is Def greet is a function greet is a function it is saying that give me name and I will give you hello name I'll give you another example you might have a function called average so what average says is average might say that you give me three number and I'll give you the average of these three numbers when you go to a cycle store what the person selling cycle says is you give me the money and what I'll do is I'll give you an amazing cycle so this is how this works and this was a very simple analogy you don't have to remember the analogy uh just remember the concepts so what we'll do is we'll simply say fun with arguments so let us say I have this function called average and it takes three values a b and c now what I I'll do is I'll simply return A+ B+ C by 3 if you're wondering how I did that using a single key press actually I'm using something called GitHub copilot and you don't have to uh worry about what what GitHub copilot is GitHub cilet is an AI pair programmer and it actually tries to find out what I'm going to type next using artificial intelligence but if you are a python beginner do not worry about GitHub copilot seriously I'm going to disable it right away so I'm going to disable it globally I don't want to use GitHub cilet anymore for this tutorial okay so I wrote a function called def average AB b c and then return a plus b plus C by3 actually this GitHub copilot is spoiling my habits I want to write my own code and this GitHub coet is not allowing me to write my own code so I don't want to use it anymore but yeah sometimes I use it when I am working on some heavy code base and I'm running out of time then this actually turns out to be Savor for me now what I'll do is I'll simply say print AVG so AVG is actually average of Three 6 and 4 so what is the average of Three 6 and four so if you add six and three it's 9 and if you add 9 + 4 uh let me make it three if if you add 9 + 3 then it's 12 you divide it by three and you get four so four should get printed on the screen and four is getting printed on the screen so how this works is 3 6 and three are passed to a b are passed to average as a b and c I should say so now a is 3 B is 6 and C is 3 so 3 + 6 + 3 / 3 is actually Four and since we have this return keyword here what happens is this is returned as four so AVG is equal to four now I hope you're getting the gist of it I hope you're getting how all these things work so you all you have to do is you have to write two three more functions if you are a beginner you should practice it again and again and definitely you'll get a hang of it you'll get how these things are working in action I hope all this makes sense to you so this is how all this works and this is how functions with arguments work in this case if you see this particular example what I'm doing is I'm saying Dev greed inside greed I'm passing single argument called name you can have one argument you can have two argument you can even have multiple arguments So Def GRE name I'm saying that I am a function and I take one argument which is called name give it to me and what I'll do is I'll do this processing so what is the processing that I'm doing gr is equal to Harry and whatever the name is passed and then I'm returning this particular value so gr is equal to hello plus name and whatever gr contains is returned back to the calling object so a is equal to greet Harry Harry is passed as name to greet now if I say gr is equal to hello plus name then name is actually Harry here so hello Harry will be printed on the screen because I'm returning gr and gr is nothing but hello plus the name that I initially passed so gr is equal to hello Harry and it will be printed here Harry's passed to greet in name a will now contain hello Harry I hope all this is clear and if it is not I want you to spend some time on this I want want you to write two three more programs on your own and definitely you'll get a gist of it default parameter value let's talk about this we can have a value as default argument what is a default argument in a function say um if we specify name is equal to stranger in the line containing def this value is used when no argument is passed for example if I say def GRE name is equal to Stranger by default the value of name will be stranger and if I pass some value the name's value will be overwritten let me explain it to you with the help of example because this way you are not going to understand it what I'll do is I'll write the same function greed and yes you can have multiple functions inside a single program not a problem at all name is equal to let us say Harry and what I'll do is I'll return I'll say hello and yes you can return in a single line you you need not create variables to return values okay so I'll say hello L plus name so if I run GRE without the arguments okay so what happens if I run a function without the arguments so let us say I don't have this three six and three it'll actually throw an error it will say that I need these values so it is saying that missing three required position arguments a b and c so what it is saying in a nerd shell is that I need these three values and you haven't provided me these three values so please provide me these three values so that I can actually process and do this and return the value of A+ B+ C / by 3 okay so let me undo it and I'll simply comment this out and what I'll do now is I will run the greed function if I run the greed function uh see I'm not printing anything so if I run the greed function nothing will happen so if I run this greed function with name say sh and if I run this uh nothing happens nothing is printed you might say that why is H should not printed on the screen I'm not using print statement there's no print anywhere here or here if I say a is equal to GRE sh and if you say print a print a and if I control s and now if I run then you'll see Hello sh so this particular value is seen by python after processing as hello plus name which is hello sh so you can either write greed sh here or you can WR write hello sh here this particular value is actually processed to hello sh greet is simply saying that I'll return hello plus whatever is passed to me okay I hope that this is clear now since I've written name is equal to Harry Harry is a default value of name so now that default value of name is present I need not pass name even if I don't pass name this is going to work fine let me show you let me comment this one out and let me move this chbe and if I run this program surprisingly or rather not surprisingly U we just talked about it why this happens uh greet will actually return hello Harry now the value of name is Harry what is the value of name Harry value of name is Harry because this is a default value we just passed a default value to greet and I hope this makes sense to you so this is all I'm saying here I'm saying that if you have name is equal to stranger and some function body now if you write this greet you'll not see any error name will be Stranger in function body because name is equal to Stranger by default this is the default value so if you see I've written default parameter value default value means that even if you don't provide this value this is going to be name is equal to stranger and if you pass something for example I passed Harry here what will happen is name will be Harry in function body because Harry's pass say name and stranger will no longer be the value of name okay I hope this makes sense and I want you to try this out open your idees open your Visual Studio codes and I want you to use that computer that you have okay so let me close this let me close this and now we'll talk about recursions now recursion is something that might get confusing for beginners let me tell you so if you are a programming beginner I would not say that you skip this topic you definitely learn this topic but recursion can go from very simple to very very complicated recursions so at this point what we'll do is we'll discuss some simple recursions I don't want you to look at recursions and then get confused and then stop learning python that's not what I want what I want you is uh what I want you to do is I want you to listen to me listen to the simple examples that I'm going to show you and then definitely you can definitely hone your programming skills further and learn more on recursions and if you're not a maths person you just simply understand what recursion actually means and how it works and that's it we'll move to the next topics after that so recursion is a function which calls itself it is used to directly use a mathematical formula as a function so this line is something that tells a lot about recursion so this is something that you'll not find in any book I have written this because this is what it is so a question is actually used to directly use a mathematical formula as a function for example let's talk about factorial let me make a program called factorial. py or rather recursion py so 04 uncore recursion dopy and I'll Simply Save it now what I'll do is I'll write a function called factorial and I'll say n and I'll simply say pass I I'll implement this body later before that what I'll do is I'll write a multi-line comment here and I'll explain you what factorial is so factorial of let us say let us say I want to find factorial of six just listen to me very very carefully and you'll understand what factorial is so factorial so let's talk about a Formula First okay I'm not a formula guy by the way but I just want to talk about a formula so factorial n is equal to factorial n -1 * n so it's n * factorial nus one this is something that you might think that hey what are you writing I don't understand all this but just hang on and listen to me very very carefully so factorial 4 is actually 4 * 3 * by 2 * by 1 how did I get this let me explain so if I want to find out factorial of three what I'll do is I'll keep on multiply multiplying three with two then one one and I'll stop when I when I reach one I'll stop okay so if I say factorial 13 and this this is going to be very tedious to write but still I write uh 13 11 then 10 then 9 then 8 then 7 then six then five then four then three then two oops I'm writing S I need I need to write X my bad x x okay so Factor 13 is actually 13 * 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 and finally 1 so once you reach 1 you can stop okay by definition factorial 0 is one okay so this is something which people find strange but this is what it is by definition factorial 1 is one by definition and if you want to find factorial of some number can I say factorial of n is factorial N - 1 * n if this sounds strange to you let me explain you why this happens can I write this particular thing as factorial 12 I can write I can actually write 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 32 1 as factorial 12 and you can try this out with any number just leave that number and multiply it by factorial of number minus one and this formula actually holds true when it comes to factorial so what I can do is I can Implement my body of this function I I need not write any for Loop and check when it is becoming one when I keep on decrementing it this is going to be very tiring what I can actually do is I'll say return n * factorial nus1 but there's a problem with this implementation and the problem is that this function never stops this function never stops it will keep on multiplying n with n minus one even if I reach one it will multiply 1 with 0o then 0 with minus one then with Min -2 - 3 - 4 - 5 - 6 7 8 9 it will keep on going negative all the way to Infinity I need to stop this so what I'll do is I'll write something called base condition so base condition actually stops recursion from happening over and over forever okay let me write um like the base condition which is if n equals to Z or n = to 1 uh oops you need to return one okay and this or doesn't work in Python so you simply say o r this actually works in C++ or C so you simply write r or R okay now if I try to find the value of of some factorials um let us say factorial 3 and obviously since I'm returning I'll have to say something like this a is equal to factorial 3 and print a and if I run this six should be printed and yes it is being printed because 3 * 2 * 1 is actually 6 if I say factorial 4 the value is 24 because 4 * by 3 2 1 is 24 and 24 should be printed if I I say zero I should get one if I say one I should get one and yes this function works if I move a step ahead and if I type factorial table and if I look into this table you can see that factorial of different numbers is shown so if I say nine I should get this number let's check let's check it out let's see if we have written the correct program or not so 36280 36280 and yes it works yes it works for seven it should be 5040 for seven it should be 5040 and yes it is right I don't want to check it forther 50/40 or program bus so finally you understood what recursion is so this is what I've explained here recursion is a function which calls uh calls itself it is used to directly use a mathematical formula as a function in this example we used factorial as an example you can use something else as an example we have Fibonacci series we have a lot of things um this is the base condition that I wrote and this is the program that we wrote and I actually explained you whatever I explained you here I've actually explained you in the notes so that you simply download the notes and even in the future if you are forgetting you can you can uh you know recall so factorial 4 is 4 multi by factorial 3 then factorial 3 can be broken into 3 into factorial 2 then factorial 2 can be broken into 2 into factorial 1 and this keeps on getting executed 4 3 2 1 andun function is returned because now we don't have any further pending calls so when I'm breaking factorial 4 into 4 into factorial 3 it will say 4 * by weight let me find out the value of factorial 3 then it will say 4 * 3 into weight let me find out the value of factorial 2 then it will say 4 * 3 * by 2 wait let me get the factorial 1's value and then we'll do the calculation and now it is ready to do the calculations 4 * 3 is 12 * 2 is 24 and function will return 24 and this is how it works okay the programmer need to be extremely careful while working with recursion to ensure that the function doesn't infinitely keeps calling itself so if a function keeps on calling itself then the loop runs infinitely and this will actually harm the programmer and recursion is sometimes the most direct way to code an algorithm but also if you try to force solving a problem using recursion you might get into troubles so when should we use recursions and when should we not I would say use recursion when it's actually straightforward to use recursion and this actually comes by solving more and more problems the more and more problems you solve the more you get the answers to these questions so if you tell me the set of problems which can be solved using recursion there's no list that I can read out and tell you that these are the set of problems you need to solve using recursions this actually Works uh like like this you you just practice and you just learn and you get experience I hope you understood what recursion is we looked into recursion we looked into factorial we looked into function we looked into function with arguments default parameter value make sure that you download these notes from the description these are amazing notes and I put in a lot of hard work to write these notes I hope you'll download this notes and get benefited from these notes notes let's move on to chapter 8 practice set now and we'll practice some functions and recursions questions so the first question says that write a program using function to find greatest of three numbers so what I'll do is I'll simply say 05 uncore pr01 py because this is the first problem of uh our chapter 8 practice set so what I'll do is I'll write a function I'll name it greatest num one is the first number num two is the second number num three is a third number and I have to find which one out of these numbers is the greatest so what I'll do is I'll simply say if num one is greater than num two so let me talk about the strategy first what I'll do is I'll find out which one out of num one and num two is the greatest and then what I'll do is I'll find out what out of the greatest of num one and num two and num three is greatest okay so let me put it this way I'll say if num one is greater than num two I'll say greater is equal to num one else what I'll do is I'll say lse greater is equal to num 2 so now what I'll do is I'll say if num3 is greater greater than greater greater L say greater is equal to uh num three if num 3 is greater than greater then greater is equal to n three otherwise greater is the greatest number out of these three so I'll say return greater let's check whether this function works I'll say a is equal to greatest of this this send this and I'll say print a and let's run this particular gold so you can say 21 is the greatest if I make 63 as greatest 63 is the greatest if I make the first number is greatest you can see that 333 is the greatest if I make it 653 653 will be the greatest how does it work okay let me explain it to you once again so what I'm doing is let us say we have three people and they want to fight ially we we we don't like fights but again let's let's just assume that three people are fighting with each other and we want to see and and let's assume that they are fighting professionally they are professional wrestlers so we have wrestler number one and two what we'll do is we'll h a match between wrestler number one and two we'll say both of you please fight and let us know who wins and whoever wins will have the greater tag now that person will fight with wrestler number three and this will prove which one out of these three is the greatest is the strongest person so this is how this logic works I hope this logic is pretty simple and I know that you understood it let's now solve problem number two two from chapter number eight practice set and the problem number two says write a Python program using function to convert Celsius to Fahrenheit so what I'll do is I'll say Celsius to Fahrenheit code uh and I'll simply copy this formula so I I needed the formula by the way not code I'll write the code myself I'll say def cell to far and cell and what I'll do is I'll say return this is the Celsius value C e l and I'll replace this x with star 9x 5 + 32 and this is how this function is going to work so I'll say cell to far I'll convert 35 to De Fahrenheit and I'll print a okay so let's see whether this works let me run this code 95 is the answer so if I say 35 is 95 the answer oh yes 95 is the answer if I say 135 is 275 the answer let's check so let me put 135 here and we have the answer is 275 which means this works and let's see if what happens if I put 137 is not divisible by five by the way so 2 78.6 is the answer so let me punch in 137 here just to check whether this works 278.50 oh yeah we our program works B1 so this is how we can write a fun function to convert Celsius to Fahrenheit okay if you don't know the formula you can simply Google but these are Basics and these are taught in class 6th to 8th most of the time sometimes in class 10th but again if you struggle to find the exact formula and even if you don't struggle to find the formula you remember the formula I always always suggest you that you go to the Google and check the formula because if the formula turns out to be wrong your program will be wrong and your code base might suffer and you don't want your code base to serer let's move on to the next problem which is how do you prevent a python print function to print a new line at the end and this is an interesting problem uh how do you prevent print to print a new line at the end and let me solve this problem as well because this is important if I say print Harry and I say and Raj and simrun what happens is Harry and Raj will be printed and and simron will be printed on the next line but what I want is I want it to print on the single line so what I can do is I can add another parameter which is end and I can say that end is equal to nothing end is equal to nothing so what happens is uh Harry and Raj will be printed and no new line will be printed by default a new line is printed after every print statement but I don't want any new line to be printed so what I'll do is I'll say end is equal to this end is equal to this means print nothing at the end of this print statement and let me show this works uh yes this works Harry and Raj and Simon so not even a single space is printed what if I make it a space if I make it a space we'll see a space after Raj let's check it works yes it works what if I make this triple hash as end so after the end of this print statement this triple hash will be printed as you can see by default a new line is printed and if you pass this end parameter then whatever you pass is the end parameter will be printed so this is quite simple but if you want to prevent print statement to print a new line all you need to do is you need to write end is equal to Simply blank okay so I hope this helps you uh what I'll do now is move on to the next question what is the next question so if you can see here the next question says write a recursive function to calculate the sum of first and natural number and this is quite simple let me tell you why let's write 08 uncore PR 04. py let us say I want to sum 1 to 8 so I'll say 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 okay this is sum 8 okay sum of first eight natural numbers and let me comment it out can I say that sum of first eight natural numbers is sum of seven natural numbers Plus 8 so can I say sum of N first n natural numbers is equal to sum of first n minus one natural numbers plus n can can I say that and yes I can say that and on the basis of this what I'll do is is I'll write a recursive function I'll say sum n and what I'll do is I'll say return sum of N minus one plus what plus n and I'll put a base condition because if I don't put a base condition this will keep on happening I'll say if this is just like factorial let me tell you if you have watched the factorial part of the video very carefully I don't think you'll face any problems with this because this is really very straightforward if Nal to one what happens is one is returned because sum of first one natural number is one okay and otherwise sum of N minus 1 plus n is return now I can simply say a is equal to sum of four and if I print a what happens is you can see if I run this code 10 is printed is it true 4 + 3 is 7 + 3 is 10 yes it's true if I say five then it should be 15 because 10 + 5 is 15 is it true yes it is true so a program works okay and this is how we can use recursions recursions means what function calling itself sum is a function it calls itself this is a function it calls itself this is a recursion okay this is really very straightforward and simple uh and let's now move on to the next question write a python function to print first end lines of the following pattern so all you have to do is enclose this logic inside a function let me show you how you can do it so I'll create a file 09 pr05 dopy and I'll simply say print pattern and I'll say n and I'll say for I in range n and what I'll do is I'll print star end times so I'll say print star and while I'm saying Print Star I want you to say n is equal to nothing why I'm doing that because I don't want a new line after every print statement and once this Loop finishes I want to print a new line so new line is back sln and if I run this program uh oops I haven't called this function so if I say PP print pattern I'll say four and I don't have to print printed because inside the function itself we have printing let's run this code uh oops let's run this code and four times this is being printed in order to solve this problem what I'll do is I'll say for I in range n and what I'll do is simply print the value of I so I'll say print I and once I print I I don't want to print this back sln uh let me tell you why I'll run this and you can see 0 1 2 3 but what I want is I want this to be be printed in reverse order so I'll simply say n minus I so n minus I will actually print it in reverse order as you can see 4 3 2 1 and this is what I want I want this to be printed four times this to be printed three times this to be printed two times and then one times so what I'll do is I'll simply say print n minus I multip by star so I I want to print star these many times so I'll say star I want Star to be printed these many times uh so I'll say multiply by this and and that should do that should do and this works so I'll remove this print back S I don't need this anymore let me try with print um print pattern three yes it works and this is how you write the code so sometimes you need to build the logic to solve a particular problem and a lot of people ask how do we build the logic to solve a problem what I will tell you is if you practice more and more automatically you can build the logic and there's no book you can read to build the logic there's no food you can eat to build the logic all you need to do is get your hand diry and start coding in your laptop and once you start coding then only you will be able to build logic like this a lot of people will ask in the comments how do I know that I need to type this how do I know I need to use for Loop and instead of asking these questions I want you to go and solve few problems out there they can be even these problems why don't you solve these problems and watch how I'm building the logic and once you complete the course you'll be able to solve most of the problems and you'll be able to definitely solve all the easy problems so this is how basically this works you don't have to read any book you don't have to do some particular thing to build the logic all you need to do is practice practice and practice and definitely you will succeed let's move on to problem number six write a python function which converts inches to centimeters pretty straightforward I don't have to solve this I've already told you convert Celsius to forhe program and all you have to do is simply go to Google find the formula punch in the formula in your python function and that's it you'll you will get the answer write a python function remove a given word from a list and strip it at the same time so what you have to do is remove a given word from a list and strip it at the same time this is an interesting problem that we are going to solve so this is problem number seven and I'm going to solve it let me delete this step code run a file I didn't create it um 10or pr07 py and what it says is you have to process so I'll simply name this as process and there is a given word and we have to do something that's all I know so we have a given string a given word from a list we have a list so I'll call it l and we have a word and what we have to do is we have to remove a word okay and strip it at the same time we have to strip the list as well I know this problem might sound a bit strange it might sound a bit uh vague I would say but let me tell you what I mean with this problem so what I want is uh want you to do is you just have to save word is equal to word dot strip okay I want you to strip a word so if a word contains spaces at the end and starting it will be stripped and then I want you to use this l. remove function to remove this word from the list so let's see if this works I'll say L1 is equal to Harry and Rohan and then we have Akash and then we have shubam and we have Lish so let's process this let's say process L1 and I want to return L1 so I'll simply say L1 is equal to process L1 and then I want to print L1 and yes L1 accept second argument as word so I want to let us say remove Harry from this let me run this and you can see that Harry has been removed what if I add some spaces before Harry Will Harry be printed yes it will be printed what if I make it Hardy uh X is not in list so X is not a list so what I'll do is I'll say if word in list then remove it okay so this will make a program error prone so um sorry not list I'll simply say l because L is the name of my list now you can see that Harry is not removed but what if I make it Rohan and add few more spaces if I run it you can see Rohan has been removed from this list and this is how it works I hope you got the point okay now what I'll do is move to the next question which is write a Python program to print multiplication table of a given number this is very straightforward and you can definitely do it I don't want to do it I want you to go ahead write def multiplication table and simply pass a number and then use for Loop and then simply give your multiplication table a very beautiful look and then print it you can also write a function to actually store that printed list uh or the print multiplication table inside your file so you can have multiplication table of 19. dxt you can have multiplication table of 12. dxt and so on so with this we have completed our chapter 8 practice set and after this what we'll do is we'll create a game and it it is going to be our first project and it'll be fun believe me so let's move on to project one now and what we'll do is we'll build a game I'm really very excited and I hope you are excited as well let's let's move on to project one and start building our game so this is a first project that we are going to code in this python course this is called snake waterer gun game if you don't know what snake waterer gun game is let me explain it to you so let me explain you the rules of the game all you need to do is you have to either choose snake water or gun and a computer will choose snake water or gun as well okay now what happens is if the computer has chosen gun and you have chosen water then water will win why will water win because there is some sort of logic which says that the water can actually drown gun and gun will no longer be functional snake can drink the water so snake and water uh if competed snake will win and water and out of snake and gun gun would win because gun can shoot snake and snake will die okay so this is how it works let me open this particular folder in vs code and let's start coding this game so I'll simply say main.py because this is the only file that we are going to have in this folder so what I'll do is I'll simply create a function or rather what I'll do is I'll simply start writing my logic so what I'll do is I'll say uh choice is equal to I'll simply say um it can either be snake which is s it can either be water or let me make it small so that it's easier to play and it it can be gun as well okay so this this is the set of choices now what will happen is I'll generate a random number so I'll import random import random and I'll use a random function so what I'll do is I'll say uh mine is equal to random. Rand okay and what does random. randin do it actually returns random number from range A to B so what I want is I want to return a random number in the range 0 to two what does it mean I either want to generate zero or I want to generate one or I want to generate two if I generate zero this will mean that uh it is a snake if I generate one uh it'll be water or else it'll be gun okay so instead of calling it mine I'll say computer and mine will actually be input I want the user to input choose either snake water or gun okay you can write a comprehensive message as well choose s for snake W for water and G for gun I just want to keep it short and simple so choice is equal to S swg and comp is equal to random r0 to two but comp should either be as W or G so what I'll do is I'll say comp is equal to Choice comp so what I'm doing is I'm actually choosing one out of these three so if the if the comp is is one the comp is now water which is W if comp is two comp is now G because what I'm doing is I'm saying comp is equal to Choice comp comp is the index choice is the stle so I'm actually converting this number into S swng as simple as that okay so now what I'll do is we have comp we have mine now what I'll do is I'll say when is equal to and I'll say snake waterer gun s swg is a function I'll pass it comp I'll pass it mine I'll pass it both of these and I'll create this function it's called snake waterer gun and it has comp it has mine and let let me not let me not procrastinate let me write it fully right away okay I'll say V is equal to S swg comp M and win will be true if I win and it will be false if I lose so I'll say if win I'll say print I'll say [Applause] U1 else what will happen else you lose oops um I accidentally pressed shift enter when you press shift enter it actually runs so anyways what I'll do is I'll say you lose now what I'll do is I'll actually try to create this function so let us say comp is equal to snake okay what are the possibilities of me winning if comp is equal to say snake if comp is snake what are the possibilities that I'll win I I'll have to choose gun to shoot the snake off and then only I can win so I'll have to say and mine equals to equals to gun then I'll win then I'll say when is equal to true then I'll say return true L if otherwise what is the second possibility that I'll win so let us assume the computer is water if computer is water only possibility for me to win is to drink that water so I'll have to be snake to win so I'll say Al If this just return true okay Al if what if computer chooses the gun my only resort to win is actually water so if computer chooses gun I'll have to choose water to drone that gun and win and I'll say return true in all other scenarios I lose so I'll return false and that's about it that's all about the function let's start playing the game so choose either of s w or G I'll say s you lose so I also want to to print the summary of the game I'll say you chose I'll write an F string here I'll say you chose um mine and the computer chose what comp and also what I'll do is I'll I'll give a coolon here so that it looks beautiful I'll run the code yet again okay so I am having a syntax I forgot to close this parenthesis for the print function so I'll simply press G so it says you chose G and the computer chose water so your gun thrown into the water so you lose why am I losing again and again I want to win this time I'll choose snake oh God okay so I chose snake come to CH snake it has to draw so if you want it to draw then you'll have to say something like this if comp equals to equals to mine then the game is draw so I'll say return none and here what I'll do I'll say if win is none I'll simply say match [Applause] drawn so I want to draw the match if win is none if win is actually true it'll print U1 else it'll say you chose this this comp to choose this and you lose and in any case I want to print the summary so I don't want to put it inside else I'll put it outside I'll say you choose this come to chose this and match can either be drawn you might even win or you might lose okay let's run this now let me choose gun this time so you choose gun computer chose S I shot the computer and I want okay so this is how I want let me try water this time oh yeah I want again so I actually chose what the computer chose gun and I won this time I'm I'm winning all the time okay so I lost eventually SG the gun shot me I died and hence I lost so was this game interesting uh not really not a lot interesting but in order to make it more interesting what do you can do is you can actually make yourself play this computer 10 times and if you win let us say more than five times you won and if computer wins more than five times computer wins so you can actually try to play this game with your friend as well instead of randomly choosing this particular uh comp variable you can actually make your friend choose either snake water or gun and then you can hide the keyboard and then you can press either s g and once you press enter the result will pop on the screen so this is pretty interesting game as is as well I mean you can make it more interesting but I don't think it's not an interesting game actually it's a very interesting game I I'm going to play this in my free time but for now I have to record uh further of this lecture so once I cover the remaining topics of this lecture I'll play this game so this was about a project one I hope you like this project we have covered all the possibilities we built some logic and I hope you understood how we built the logic of this game uh I hope this was helpful for you make sure you access all the notes and I'm saying this again and again because I've written this notes with a lot of hard workk and I want all of you to access these notes so with that said let's move on to chapter number nine now and study further topics of python the next Topic in this python course is file IO what exactly is file IO let's talk about files and how do we read and write files in Python before we talk about file IO and actually read write and a to files I want you to have an understanding of what Ram is what your hard disk is and how all these things work together because after you have the understanding of all these things you'll be able to understand file iio better so the random access memory is volatile and all of its contents are lost once the program terminates so you must have heard of memory when we talk about program efficiency memory is nothing but a ram if I go to my task manager and I try to uh see how much RAM I have you can see my computer stats here you can clearly see that I am using 64 GBS of memory it means that I actually have a 64 GB of total RAM installed on my system so this 64GB of RAM is actually required to run the programs when they load so when I fire Google Chrome my Ram will actually hold the contents of it when I'm actually loading the windows it will hold some of the contents of the programs that are running in the background and once I turn off my computer all of those contents are lost what sometimes what I want to do is I want to actually write something to my storage for example I might create a video and I want and I might want it to persist there forever so for instance I'm recording this video I want this video to persist on my hard disk so that I can upload it on YouTube so a file is data stored in a storage device so the device which actually contains all the files that persist forever even when the computer is turned off is hard disk drive and solid state drives file is the data stored in those storage devices a Python program can talk to the file by reading content from it and writing content to it so here's a visual representation so let us say this is me I'm writing a program this is the computer program written in Python what I can do is I can actually write to this file and I can read from this file meaning that that content is not lost when I turn off my computer since this content is not lost even when I turn off my computer this type of storage is called nonvolatile storage and RAM is the volatile storage if I turn off my computer all the data of the programs which is unsaved will be lost and I'll not be able to recover it so that kind of storage is volatile storage so whatever is stored in Ram is volatile storage we are going to deal with non volti storage using file iio in Python and we'll be able to write read and append to files okay so let's talk about two types of files in Python there are two types of files text files and binary files text files are the ones that you can open using notepad and read the content from them it can be Json it can be some sort of source code like Doc it can be some sort of source code like py and we can actually read write and append using a notepad in case of binary files the data is stored in the form of zeros and ones and it is usually a bit tricky to edit these kind of files so in order to edit such kinds of files we'll need some sort of program which can help us edit these files so jpg we need some sort of Photo Editor to edit this file datat we need some sort of program which can write to datat files so python has a lot of functions for reading for updating and for deleting files we'll have a look at these functions let's talk about opening a file how can we open a file in python python has an open function and yes it's a buil-in function you can use open function the first argument is the name of the file and then second argument is the mode of opening the mode of opening is actually the mode which tells the computer which tells the python interpreter what you want to do with this file so you have given a file name okay so this is a file what do I do with it should I read from it should I write to it or should I prepare to append to it so whatever mode we give in advance the python interpreter will be ready to perform the actions corresponding to this mode okay so it takes two parameters file name and mode we'll give the file name we'll give the mode and open is a buil-in function let's try out reading a file so what we'll do is we'll actually read from a file in Python and we'll try to use this open function f is equal to open this.t is the file name r is the read mode and we want to open the file in read mode the next thing we can do is we can actually perform a read operation in this file object so f is a file object f is equal to open this. txtr we can read content from it then we can print this text and finally and yes this step is important important we need to close the file when I say close the file you need to run app. close so that all the resources that this particular program is blocking can be released so f. close is really very important and you must do it running Dot close on F simply tells the program that you are done with the file and other programs can read WR or app to this file so let's come to a Visual Studio code I'm going to open this folder in Visual Studio code so that I can explain all these things to you let me create a program called 01 file. py and let's try to do all these things what I'll do is I'll say f is equal to open and I'll simply say this. txt and since I want to open it in read mode I'll say R now what I'll do is I'll say text is equal to F do read now I can print this text as you can see here and this text will be printed on the screen but there is no file called this. txt so if I try to run this program this is going to give me an error that there is no file called this. txt in the directory you are running this program from so what I'll do is I'll create a file called b.txt and I'll say this is a file in Python okay these are some random set of characters please ignore these I'll simply run this code so that I can read this file and if I say this is a file and if I remove in Python what happens is run this program it'll read this file again and it'll print this as a file so basically I'm able to read from this file and these set of lines work now in a similar fashion I can even write to a file in a very similar way I can even append to a file let's discuss more about these things we can specify the number of characters in read function you can actually say f. read 2 this will read first two characters from the file let's try this out as well if I say f. read 6 I should should get first six characters so five and one six so 1 2 3 4 5 6 I'm getting six characters from my file which is great did you see I miss something here what is it I should have run f. clothes whenever you are hungry at night and you have a refrigerator at your house and you want to eat some apples from the fridge what do you do you just go to the refrigerator you open the refrigerator you take the Apple out of the refrigerator and you close the refrigerator you close the refrigerator we are doing the same thing here we are actually using the file we are reading text from it and finally we are closing the file just like we close the refrigerator after we are done eating the items from the fridge so this is how it works you should close the file so that all the resources which are held by this pointer can be released okay now let's come back to this particular f. readline function let's create another function or let me do the same here instead of read what I'll do is um I'll simply say I'll simply say text is equal to F do read line so text is equal to F do read line okay and if I run this code the first line is has been read okay so second line third line okay so what happens is as you keep keep on running this f. read line next line will keep on being read so if I run this oops cancel if I run this twice uh which means if I say f. read lines twice this particular text variable will contain the first line and the next call to read lines will contain the second line and the third call to read lines uh read line will actually contain the third line you can see this is a file and then second line and if I run it once again I should get third line and you got the point now there is another function called read lines and what it does is let me let me actually do something like this and I want you guys to keep this code so I don't want to delete this code I want to keep this code so that you can recall what has been discussed in the course now if I print text let me do control D to replicate and contrl S now the text is a list so now since I've called f. read lines what read lines does is it actually reads all the lines and stores them into a list and returns that list so this time text is not a list sorry text is not a string it's a list so let me call it text list I don't want to confuse you so I'll name my variable very very smartly so that I can remember that app. read lines actually returns a list and not a string okay so this is how this works and let's come back to our nodes and let's look into modes of opening a file so we saw other methods to read the file I told you read line I also told you about read liance and both of these functions comes handy as well if you want to read all the lines from a file all at once you can use read lines or if you want to read the lines one by one you can use this f. readline now we'll talk about modes of opening a file now we have this R mode which is plain and simple reading then we have this W mode and W mode is used for writing remember the mode is the second argument of this open function the third type of mode is append mode and a is actually return when we want to open a file for a pending we use plus if you want to open a file for updating now these are not the only modes let's talk about some other things as well if I add B to this R this means that this file is open for reading and in binary mode if I say RT it means this file is open for reading in text mode so RT means reading in text mode RB means reading in bite mode or binary mode okay let's now learn how to write files in Python in order to write to a file we first open it and write or append mode in write or append mode after which we use the python. write method to write to that file okay and I have an example here I'll show you this example what we'll do now is create another file create another python source file I'll say filor write. py and since this is following the same syntax what I'll do is I'll say write. TX T and instead of writing R I'll say w and now what I'll do is I'll use this f. close as well but more than that I'll use the right function so right function actually takes a string and also say this is a text I want to write to this file okay so I'll Simply Save this and I'll run this see there is no right. txt here but what I'll do is I'll create a right. txt by running running this program so once I run this program a right. txt file will be created and you watch out watch out for that here once I run the code you can see that right. txt has been created and this string has been inserted inside this file R.T so this is how we write files in Python I hope this was straightforward and simple so f. write this is nice this can be called multiple times so so let me show you how this can be called multiple times I'll say second line and if I run this program once again you can see that this right. txt contains this as well as this but I'll do one thing here I'll print a back slash in here so that you can see this in second line so you can see this in second line so this is how writing to a file Works in Python okay now let's talk about width statement but before that I want to tell you about append mode so I'll create another file I'll say file uncore append and here what I'll do is I'll rename this to file uncore read why am I doing all these renames because I want you to have this source code as a resource which can use to revise your Python Programming because you are doing this course with me you need to keep these files and you need to you'll have a good understanding of what you learned while you were doing this course so so this is why what I'm doing is I'm naming these files very very carefully so that you can go back with these files and notes and you can revise Python Programming as in when required so we are here what I'll do is I'll copy all the code here and instead of opening it in right mode I'll open it in append mode and let's see what happens right. txt is a file which already has two lines let's see what happens when we run this program when we run this program these two lines are appended to write. txt once again and if I keep on running this program I'll keep on appending lines to this file you can see that this file keeps on growing as and when I run this program so in append mode what happens is I keep on adding lines to the file okay I'll stop here uh I I'll not append any more lines to this file so what I was saying is if you want to open this file in append mode all you have to do is use an a here and once you use a here whatever you write to this file will now be appended at the end of the file so the so the content of the file will not be lost but if you write w whatever is there in the file will be cleared out will be washed out and then your content will be written inside the file so this is something you need to be aware of this is something this is a mistake actually which people do what they think is that they are writing to a file they're writing to the end of the file but when actually what they are doing is they're wiping out all the content of a file and then write into it so you might lose content of a file for example let us say this is some important 32 line document that I have and it's a.txt file if I accidentally open it in right mode and if I run this I lose everything I lose everything from this file so you need to be very very careful when you are opening files using python okay let me do one thing here for you I'll say write mode and then I'll say append mode so if I put a here this is append mode so this is how right mode and append mode works now what I'll do is I'll come back to the notes and talk about withd statement instead of saying f is equal to open then f. write f. close you can actually write these two lines and what these two lines does is it will automatically close your file so you can do something like this and this this is something that you'll usually see so I'll say 0 4ore wi.py and you can do something like this with open mine. txt in right mode as F and then f. right uh oops this file is mine okay so this is something that you can do there is no mine. txt here by the way if I run this program you'll see a mtxt is created and this particular text has been been inserted so this is a shortcut that you can use with statement and this will automatically close the file no need to call f. close if you're using with so this completes our chapter number nine which was file IO I hope you enjoyed this chapter uh let's read what I have to say here the best way to open and close a file automatically is the WID statement you can use the syn and don't need to write f. close as it is done automatically so this actually helps a lot and you'll find with statement a lot when it comes to opening and writing to files so this completes the chapter number nine let's move on to chapter N9 practice set now so that we can practice more on file IO let's move on to chapter 9 practice set now so let's move further now and let's talk about chapter 9 practice set so this is the practice set which I've created for you and we are going to practice some of the questions from this practice set so the first question says write a program to read the text from a given file poem .txt and find out whether it contains the word twinkle so let me do one thing for you let me write uh new program I'll say p1. py and what I'll do is I have this poems. txc right here I'm going to pull this file out of here okay I'm I'm going to move this file outside this new folder so this is the poems. txt file it actually contains the word twinkle and we are going to write a program which can detect whether this contains twinkle or not so I'm going to open this file I'm going to say with open um what's the name of the file poems. txt in read mode and we are going to say as F and I'm going to say f. read or rather I can write my logic right here if F if the word twinkle in f. read what I'm going to do is I'm going to say print yes twinkle is present else what I'll do is I'll say no twinkle is not present so I'll say print and I'll say uh the word twinkle is not present and I'm going to run this program yes stringle is present and let let me remove the word twinkle from here I'm simply altering the file so that it doesn't contain the word twinkle anymore and once I do that and once I run this program again you can see that word tole is not present so this is how you can detect the word inside a file so what I'll do now is I'll move on to question number two which is the game function in a program let a user play a game and returns a score as an integer you need to read a file High score. txt which is either blank or contains the previous high score you need to write a program to update the high score whenever game breaks the high score so this is a function that we are going to write so I'm going to say 06 pr02 py game is a function so let me write def game I'm going to implement it later now what I'll do is I'll import random random module will allow me to generate some random integers I'll say score is equal to random. Randon and I'm going to store um and I'm going to say 100 so because I want to generate a score from 0 to 100 I want to print the score as an F string and I'm going to say score and yes it returns this score I'm just printing the score so that I can know which score is being returned by the uh function game now what we'll do is we are going to read a file high score. txt so I'll simply say with open I'll say high score. txt and yes I'm going to uh open it in right mode I'm going to say score or rather high score is equal to f. read and yes this high score is going to be a string so let me correct the syntax here as F and I'm going to pass this as integer and now what I'll do is I'll simply say if high score is greater than score uh sorry if score is greater than high score if score is greater than high score what we need to do is we need to once again write this score back to high score. txt so here I was reading this file now I'll write to this file so let me show you how I'm going to do all these things I'm going to say f. write and I'm going to write um St Str and high score I'm going to write this high score um or other score let me explain what I'm doing here but before that I'll have to call this score function I'll have to say score is equal to game so score is equal to game will actually return a score and that score is going to be stored inside the score variable now what I'll do is I'll see whether this score is greater than the high score is greater than the existing score if it doesn't then we are not going to do anything but if it does if we have broken the high score then what we'll do is we'll open this high score file and this time I'm going to write so I need to open it in write mode and I'm going to write this to the high score file let let me create a high score. dxt and let me say five so let us say five is the high score let me run this program okay so it says uh Rand in missing one position requirement B okay so I need to pass two integers to Rand in let me run it once again the score is six six has been printed now let me call it again score is 32 so 32 has been updated now if I call it again the score is 50 it should update now let me call it again the score is 62 it should update once again let me call it once again it's 48 it should not update this time because 48 is not greater than 60 62 and yes it has not updated so as in when we break the high score 69 it should update as in when we keep on breaking the high score it will keep on updating the high score. txt file 80 once again yes we have broken the high score so it will update it'll not update once again it will not update it will not update you can see it has not updated since 80 once again 43 once again 92 it should update this time and yes it has updated so this is how all these things are working I hope you understood the point of the question and I hope you were able to understand the logic behind the question write a program I'm solving question number three now write a program to generate multiplication tables from 2 to 20 and write it to the different files place these files inside a folder for a 13y old so I know there are many 20 25 30 35 40 45 years old as well here watching this video who are not good at multiplication tables so I should have updated this to say some some n year old uh what I'll do is I'll move on to solve this problem I'll say 07 pr03 dopy and what I'll do is I'll generate some multiplication table so I'll say for I in range and we need to generate multiplication table from 2 to 20 so I'll say two and I'll write 21 because I want it to go from 2 to 20 so the range function actually includes two but it doesn't include 21 so range 2 to 21 will go from two all the way to 20 now what I'll do is I'll generate the multiplication table I'll say table is equal to blank and what I'll do is I'll simply say for J in range [Music] 1 to 11 because I want it to go from 1 to 10 I'll say table plus equals to I'll write an F string here I'll say j j and then let me also write I so I'll say I * by J is equal to I mtip by J and I'm actually performing the calculation here and at the end I want a back SL okay and this table once generated will be stored inside a file with open taable slash and let me create an F string here I'll simply say i. txt because this is multiplication table of I and I'm going to explain this program once again so you need not worry about what I'm doing here I'm just building the logic and I'm going to tell you how I build this logic so what I'm doing here is I'm simply starting from Two and going all the way to 20 and I'm doing for all these numbers this particular thing what is this particular thing I'm creating a blank string and inside this blank string I'm iterating from 1 to 10 and I'm putting this I * J is equal to I * J which is the multiplication table of I so I is going from 2 to 20 so I'll start from 2 I'll print the multiplication table of two this will first generate the multiplication table of two then 3 4 5 all the way to 20 while I'm generating multiplication table of say two this will be executed from 1 to 10 so 2 * 1 is equal to 2 2 * 2 is equal to 4 2 * 3 is equal 6 this is being written inside my table variable which is a string and finally what I'm doing is I'm going to write this table inside my table / i. txt file in this case table /2. txt file and let me see if it works and it says no file out directory table /2. I need to create an an empty folder called tables and this will work now let me run this and yes it worked let me open this and you can see the multiplication table of two is generated three is generated four 5 6 let me check for 14 yes it's generated 19 oh yes it's right so all these multiplication tables have been generated you can hand it over to some 13 years old or 17 years old if he doesn't know how these multiplication tables work and if he doesn't remember these you can hand it over to that person as well how this works is something I'm going to explain you once again so I am doing this particular thing from 2 to 20 because I want to generate multiplication table from 2 to 20 let us say we are generating multiplication table for two every time I'm generating a multiplication table I'm actually creating a an empty string now what I'm doing is I'm I'm going from 1 to 10 because range function actually includes 1 but doesn't include 11 it goes from 1 to 10 I'm going from 1 to 10 and I am adding this particular string to my table string initially table string was blank so I'm adding 2 * 1 is equal to two then once again this Loop will add 2 * 2 is equal to 4 a new line then once again 2 * 3 is equal to 6 a new line 2 * 4 is equal to 8 a new line 2 * 5 is equal to 10 then a new line and finally 2 * 10 is equal to 20 a new line now my table string contains this particular thing I'll show you what this particular thing will be inside my table string I'm actually writing this string to 2.txt so I is starting from 2 to 20 so in this case I'm writing this particular uh this particular string which I generated to 2.txt and this will keep on doing this for 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 16 17 18 19 and 20 so I have these multiplication tables generated I hope you got this point I hope you got uh how we generated these 19 tables we don't have table of one it doesn't make any sense so I started from two I hope this question helped you understanding file IO and how you can write inside a folder okay now let's move on to question number four question number four says a file contains a word donkey multiple times you need to write program which replaces this word with this by updating the same file this is not a good word you should not use donkey I mean for a person and just because somebody is using this word in context of a person we want to replace it with this let's see how we can do this so what we'll do is we'll read from the file we'll update the string and we'll write it back to the file so let's do it this is question number 4 so let me say 08 uncore pr0 4. py let us say this file is called file.txt I'm going to read this file with open file.txt as if okay oops I I I I should have written this inside this program and not there so I want to read this file let us say this contains uh hey you are uh this is not a good thing for donkey okay so I'm going to write this now let us let us read so I'll say text is equal to f. read and obviously I'm going to open it in read mode now what I'll do is I'll say text is equal to text. replace and I'm going to replace this word with 1 2 3 4 5 6 okay and now what I'm going to do is I'm going to do exactly the same thing except the fact that instead of reading I'm going to write this time and I'm going to write this time and I'm going to write this text and yes I'm going to remove this equals to I hope the syntax is correct and yes it is hopefully let's see if it updates the file yes it does update the file okay so I hope you understood how these things are working how I solve this problem and let's move on to the next question so repeat program 4 for a list of such words to be censored so we are actually censoring this particular thing so if you have a list of words to be censored for for example we had donkey in this case you might have a list of words and you want to actually replace them with with these hashes what you'll have to do there is you'll have to replace this line with a fall Loop and you'll have to iterate through that list which contains words like donkey and you'll have to keep on running do replace on text so I want you to try it on your own okay let's move on to question number six now write a program to mine a log file and find out whether it contains python so all you need to do in this program is you need to read a file the log file and you need to find out whether it contains python or not and this should be easy just have to perform an f. read and once you read from a file you have to find out whether python is inside that string so if your string is say text you can say if python in text then return true else return false if you're writing a function or you can print something I hope this is also clear moving on to question number seven wrer program to find out the line number where python is present from question number six so what you'll do is you'll keep on performing f. read line so you can say F do read line and keep on doing until you find the word Python and keep on maintaining a variable so let us say I have a variable I I'll keep on running f. read lines and every time I run f. read line not read lines read line okay I have to run f. read line to read the first line then once again I'll have to run f. read line for the second line then for the third line and what I'll do is inside a loop I will keep a variable and I'll keep on incrementing that variable and once I find the word python I can actually use that variable to find out which line number contained the word python I want you to try this on your own I want you to take it as a challenge and try this question out I know uh you'll have to you'll have to think a bit about it but I want you to actually solve this problem so that you are exercising your muscles as well so write a program to make a copy of a text file this. txt and this is going to be very easy all you have to do is read a file and write to another file so you can do this question number eight is super simple question number nine write a program to find out whether a file is identical and matches the content of another file or not this is super simple as well read both the files and do the string matching I don't have to do this question for you because this is super simple write a program to wipe out the contents of a file using Python and this is once again super simple I'll tell you why because all you have to do is you just have to write to that file and empty string just say f. write and empty string and it is going to wipe out all the contents of the text file question number 11 write a Python program to rename a file to renamed by python. txt we are going to do this this is going to be fun I'm going to solve question number 11 uh pr0 pr0 pr11 py so I'll say file name is equal to input I'll say enter the name of the file to rename which file you want to rename and new name let me call it old name new name let's enter the name of the file you want to enter the new name of the file so what I'm going to do is I'm going to read the old file so I'll say with open and I'll say old name in read mode as F and I'm I'm going to say text is equal to app. read now what I'll do is I'm going to use this new name and I'm going to say f. write and I'm going to say text now you might argue that I'm not renaming it I'm actually creating a new file and you know dumping the content of the previous file if you want to delete it you can use a utility called OS module in Python I can actually delete using OS module and if you if you don't know how to delete you can say how to delete a python file uh sorry delete a file in Python using OS and and and you will find out how to do this os. remove is a function which can help you out with that so you can actually use that so you can say os. remove and let me import [Applause] OS I can say I want to remove this old name file let's try this out now so we have this right. txt here what I'll do is I'll run this program I'm going to say write. txt and I'm going to say new name by python. dxt and it says no such file out directory okay so I I I should have said write my bad because I'm writing I'll say mtxt or I'll simply say right. txt and I'll say renamed by python. txt and yes it is renamed by python. txt and right. txt is no longer present so kind of I've renamed the file not the best way to rename a file in an operating system because if the file is extremely huge this method might not be the best way to rename a file in Python but again you can do this you can simulate few things and practice your python skills this is going to help you a lot so with this we have finished chapter 9 practice set I hope you guys enjoyed this now we are going to do another project which is amazing as well because it's another game let's move on to our project 2 and see what it has to offer so now that we have learned so many python Concepts we are going to look into project number two and let's see what project number two has to offer as you see the name of the project or rather the game is the perfect guess we are going to write a program that generates a random number and ask the user to guess it so we have a user we have to generate a random number and we want user to guess it if the user guess guesses the number right then he wins definitely and if he fails to guess the number then yeah he loses but let's add some spice to the problem or rather the game and make it more enjoyable able so what we are doing is if the player's guess is higher than the actual number the program displays lower number please this is going to make the task easy for the guesser or the person playing the game so let us say the number is 46 and you entered 63 you will be told that the number you guessed is actually lower or higher whatever the case is and then you can actually tweak your guess and try to reach the number in a very similar way if the user guesses uh too low the program prints higher number blades when the user guesses the correct number the program displays the number of guesses for the player and yes the less the number of guesses the better the guesser the person is okay so we are going to use random module for sure but let's see how so let's dive a bit deep into this one and let's open this with code so I'm going to open this particular folder with VSS code and I'm going to create main. p y so I'll click this plus icon and I'll say main.py why did I say main.py and why am I not making 01 uncore main.py I just want to tell you that this is the only file that I'm worried about when it comes to project number two so corresponding to project number two this is the only file that I want to make so let's now do uh import random because we are going to use this random module and what I'm going to do is I'm going to say that guess the number so I'll say guess is equal to int of input and I want to ask user to guess the number and the user is going to guess the number then what I'm going to do is I'm going to generate the number but before asking user to guess the number I want to generate the number so I'm going to say random. Randon and I want to pass two numbers I'm going to uh use 1 to 100 and now what I'm going to do is I'm going to say if the user guess is greater than the number if it's greater than the actual number we are going to tell the user that hey guess another number so we'll say uh guess is equal to guess another number this one is too big okay so we are just telling that this one is too big big we want you to guess another number and the person guessing the number will hopefully guess it right next time we'll say this one is to less so we'll say if if the guess is lesser than the number then we are going to make him guess once again now what what what will happen is this will keep on happening until the guess is equal to number so what I'll do is I'll say else you guessed it so I'll say print I'll say yeah that's the number you guessed it right in these many attempts and attempt is going to be a variable so I'll say attempt is equal to 1 and I'm going to use this inside here and yes I need to make this an F string and close the print statement so this is the program that I wrote so what happens is I'm generating a number from 1 to 100 I'm setting my attempt variable to one and what I'm doing is I'm asking the user to guess the number I'm saying guess is equal to int input guess the number so I'm saying guess the number and once you guess we want to compare the guess with the actual number if it's equal to the number then it'll go inside else otherwise if guess is greater than the number this will happen if the guess is less than the number this will happen and if guess is neither greater nor lesser than the number it means the guess is equal to the number in which case it will go into the lse statement and since it is going inside the else statement this will print but we don't want this to happen just for one single time we want this to happen again and again and again so what we are going to do is we are going to run this inside a v Loop and this y Loop will keep on running um forever and if it runs forever we are never going to stop and this will be a problem so once the user guesses the number right I'm going to break out of this Loop so what I'm saying is I'm saying if you are able to guess correctly we are going to break out of this Loop okay so this this is what happens okay so what I'm going to do now is I'm going to increment my attempt variable why do I increment my attempt variable I want to increment the attempt variable because if the guess is not right I want to say that attempt should be increased by one and let's see if this program works I mean I don't know let's see if this program works I might have made some mistake so it says that this one is too big let's try 34 it says this one is too less let's try 40 it says this one is too less which means I need to increase the number I'll say 45 this time um if I say 45 this one is too less so I need to increase it 49 49 is too less as well is 50 52 is 52 the number no 52 is too less is 54 the number it says this one is too big it means 53 should be the number and yes it says yeah that's the number 53 is the number you guys would write in eight attempts did I took eight attempts or did I just you know wrote the program wrong this was my first attempt 1 2 3 4 5 6 78 yes I guessed it in eight attempts and this is the and this is the program okay this is the game so how do two different people play this game and compete against each other what you can do is you can make yourself play the game and note down the number of attempts you took to guess the number and then you can ask your friend to play the same game and you can note down the number of attempts he took to guess the number and you can repeat this process three times so this is one match so so there's a high chance that you and your friend guess the number and say four attempts so this is the first match it it tied then you can play the second match it might not tie or it might tie then you can play the third match it might tie or it might not try tie and you can play five different matches whoever wins more than twice or whoever wins more than the other person wins the game and there's always a chance of die even if you play it 51 times or 100 times or 200 times there's always some probability that it will die U that's a different story U but this is the game and I hope you enjoyed this game so I want you guys to play this game with your friends because I know you have played cyber punk you have played GTA you have played GTA 5 GTA y City you might have played Road Rash I want you to play this game because this is something that you have created yourself and you'll be proud of yourself when you make you and your loved one play this game so this was about the project number two this is the project number two PDF download all the resources including the source code everything from the description I'm saying this again and again because I'm supplying everything to you for free in the description so you need to download all the material let's now move on to the next chapter and we'll now talk about objectoriented programming object oriented programming is really very important and I want you to listen listen to me very very carefully when I explain you oops Concepts so let's move on to chapter number 10 and see what oops has to offer let's now talk about objectoriented programming once again one of the most important topics hands down and I'm going to explain this topic to you in great detail and you need to listen to me very very carefully if you are listening to me what is objectoriented programming it's a programming Paradigm procedural programming is a programming Paradigm how is objectoriented programing different from procedural programming and what makes it different why is everybody talking about oops Concepts these days why is everybody talking about classes and objects why is everything being done using classes and objects when the complexity of the program increases we are going to talk about this so solving a problem by creating objects is one of the most popular approaches in programming so one thing that we need to remember is that object oriented programming is not something that you need to learn to accomplish something definitely you accomplish few things like clean code better maintenance and all these things but anything that you are going to do using object red programming can be done using procedural programming or something that we have already seen like functions writing lines of codes one after the other video without creating any function or um or using the modules Al together okay but this is a concept this is an approach of programming which makes few things easier so this concept focuses on using reusable code one of the concepts which was focusing on reusable code was functions we talked about functions okay but this is something that takes it to another level so what we want to do is you want to implement Drive principle and we want to keep everything organized what we are basically doing in object-oriented programming is we are modeling or code using the real word implementation of something so let let us say I am into business of making cars and I want to model cars I want to say have colors for the cars different designs for the car different types of handles for the cars different types of steerings for the cars different types of wheels for the cars if I want to do all those things what I can do is I can write a class for my car so class is a blueprint for my car so maruti Suzuki 800 can be a class maruti Suzuki Wagar can be another class Mar Marti Suzuki 800 represents one car maruti Suzuki wagonr represents another car I can create more than 100 wagars using my blueprint so maruti Suzuki company should be having some sort of blueprint and they must be using that blueprint to create cars for their customers in a very similar way what we'll do is we'll create a blueprint you can think of blueprint as a blank form and we can fill that form to accomplish few tasks let's see what it means so let's talk about class let's talk about the concept of class in object-oriented programming a class is a blueprint for creating objects it's as easy as that how do I explain this to you let me explain it using a blank form example in front of you is a blank form and this contains info to create a valid application let us say you are going to the railway counter and you want to get your bookings done in India we have to go to the railway counter ask for the form fill that form and give it to the counter and once we give it to the counter we can get a ticket to travel with Indian railways so in a very similar way a form can be filled by a student you can get a blank form you can download the PDF from the Internet or you can do whatever it takes to get the blank form now what you do is you fill in that form using your details you fill in your name you punch in your age you punch in your date of birth you punch in your whatever whatever information is required you can punch in your marks in class 12th 10th marks in class 11th what do you want to apply for where do you want to go for the exam your Center and all those things you can apply for everything and whatever is being asked in the form there will be fields in the form you will have to fill those fields now this is not a blank form anymore because you have already filled this form this is your application you can call that this paper this piece of paper is my application before filling that form form you can say that this piece of paper is a blank form now what you are going to do is you are going to say that this piece of paper is my application so you have Associated this word my with this form just because this form contains your details now since this form contains your details this form is yours so this is an object and the blank form was a blueprint it was not associated with you it was not representing anything meaningful now it is representing something which is really very meaningful for you and it is your application in a very similar way we have class class contains info to create a valid object blank form contained the info to create a valid application why did you go for the blank form why didn't you go for a blank piece of paper just because that blank form contains all the fields you need to fill in a very similar way class contains the info to create valid object and once you instantiate that object you can look at instantiation as filling the form once you instantiate the object this is an entity which you can work upon let's look into the syntax of class in of talks I'm going to look into the syntax of class now I'm going to open this particular folder in Visual Studio code and I'm going to write a program 01 uncore class. py just look at this statement what I'm doing is I'm saying class employee and I'm saying name is equal to Harry and what I'm doing is um and what I'm doing is I'm simply saying Max is equal to 34 the next set of things that I can possibly add to this implementation is say uh Center where I want to apply for the exam I can say delhi now what I can do is if I run this program nothing is going to happen because what I've done is I've created a blank application just like we had this blank application form this is a blank application form and this is not going to do anything why do I say that because I have not instantiated any object out of it this is a blueprint this is information to create an object this is not an object what is an object I can create an object called Harry I can say Harry is equal to I can say employee now I've created an object called Harry it behaves like a variable but what I can do is I can print all these fields like this I can say harry. marks and once I say this you can see that 34 is being printed I can say Harry do Center and you can see that that dele has been printed I can say harry. name and definitely Harry will be printed so you can do all these things using classes and objects okay so this was very very basic introduction of class and this was the basic object I can say a basic object and here also I'll write a comment a sample Class A very basic and and you'll come to know why why I'm calling it a very basic sample class I'm calling it a very basic sample class because we don't have instance variables we don't have Constructor we don't have get ERS we don't have Setters we are going to talk about all these things very soon so this was the basic example of class okay let's move ahead class name is written in Pascal case so this is something that you need to keep in mind so whenever you are naming a class you don't have to you know name the class using small letters I could have used small e then m p l o y we e but I'm using a capital E because when we are creating a class or rather naming a class what we try to do is we try to keep it in Pascal case Pascal case means that the first letter of a variable is capital and anything that goes after it is also started with capital for example if I have to write employee for say LG I I I'll do it something like this I'll say employee for LG so e is capital F is capital L is capital so this is called Pascal case okay okay let's now talk about object what is an object an object is an instantiation of a class when class is defined a template is defined memories are located only after object instantiation what does it mean so we had a blueprint we had a class this was a blueprint to create object this was some information which can be used to create objects what is an object Harry is an object here so Harry is an object I could have created another object called sham I could have created another object called Ranjit Rohan or anything I can even you know I can even say something like this a is equal to employee and this is a valid synex I can create any number of employee using this employee class now and these all will all the employees that I'll create will have all these name marks Center set okay so this is something that we can do but once we create a class what happens is only the memory for storing this code is reserved by The Interpreter but when we create Harry is equal to employee memory for this particular object is reserved so all the storage which is required to store name marks and Center for this particular variable is reserved by The Interpreter so this is something that you need to remember and this is what I'm saying here an object is an instantiation of a class when class is defined a template is defined memory is located only after object instanciation in this case the moment that Harry is equal to employee and run this code the memory is allocated at line number seven but if I don't write this memory will not be allocated for Harry object only this blueprint will be defined but as and when we create this object the memory will be allocated this is something that we need to remember objects of a given class can invoke the methods available to it without revealing the implementation detail to the user and this is called abstraction and ENC encapsulation what I'll do is I'll create a sample method inside this class for you and I'll show you how it works but let's move to to another program just to keep things simple I want you to refer to this program and look at just this piece of code so that it's easier for you to understand what a class is so I'll say class with methods. py and I'm going to start from here let me save this code let me save this one as well and let's add a method here so I'll simply say uh def print and this by default takes self okay now what I'll do is I'll simply say or let me call it print obj because print is already a built-in function in Python I'll say def print obj self now what I'll do is I'll say print I'll use an F string I'll say the name is self. name can you see this implementation of self and I'm going to explain to you what self is and and and let's just print the name I I could have printed marks and Center as well but I'm not doing that I'm just keeping it simple by printing just the name so now what I can do is I can say harry. print obj and let's see if this piece of code actually runs so I have not called the function since print obj is a function I need to call it like this now if I run it you can see that none has been printed because this particular thing doesn't return anything so I should not print it because I'm not returning anything from it if I'm returning something from it I can print that thing but if I'm not returning anything I just need to call it and it will be invoked so the moment I say harry. print obj this particular piece of line is invoked and this function is returning nothing I could have added a return statement and returned something but I don't want to do that okay so Harry print obj will actually print this line of code or rather this line of uh text this name is Harry okay so I hope you got the point I hope you understood what methods inside the classes and how they work but let's talk about this self a bit more the moment you write a function inside a class you need to add this self you need to add self as a parameter why do you need to do that why do you need to add self as as a parameter let me tell you what happens is the moment you are running this function on some object definitely if you are creating an object you will run this function only on that object you cannot run this function as is by simply saying print obj if I if I say something like this this is not valid because print obj will not work like this if I write something like this this is going to throw some error you can see this is saying that print obj is not defined I can call this upon an object but I cannot call it like this so I need to Define this function I need to add the self so that I can use all the properties of my class or rather this object and yes then I can operate this Sprint obj inside that object okay I hope you got the point now what I'm going to do is I'm going to move further and talk about abstraction and encapsulation the moment we create a class employee we are basically abstracting any information from somebody who might use the this class so I can give this class as code as a service you don't have to know what is written inside the code you just use it I can simply say that employee is a class you can use this to instantiate a basic class and use these methods these are the available methods and you don't have to understand how I have written this class A very good example of this is numpy let's talk a bit about numpy so if you go to numpy numpy gives you few syntax to write arrays in Python so they simply tell you that we have these functions you can use this class this that and other but it doesn't tell you how it is implementing all these things behind the hood and it should not tell you all these things because you because you are not interested in all those things you are simply interested in how you are implementing or using the offering from numai so you want to create an array you are only interested in creating an ARR for example I'm if I'm using a software to merge two PDFs I don't care how they are merging the PDFs I just need my PDFs merged when you're using Facebook you don't care how Facebook is storing your data or how Facebook is working behind the hood you just want to talk to your friends you just want to send messages you just want to update your timeline that's all you interested in in a very similar way a user might only be interested in using your code and not knowing the detailed implementation of your code and this is called abstraction and when we say encapsulation basically what I'm doing is I'm encapsulating all these variables and functions inside a single capsule or rather inside a single class and this process is called encapsulation I hope you understood what encapsulation is modeling a problem in OES now this is something that you need to understand how do you model a problem in objectoriented programming in Python so what we do is in order to model a problem in object oriented programming what we do is we identify the following for a problem what is a noun in a problem what is the adjective in our problem and what is the verb in our problem let's say I want to model employee okay the name or the noun is actually the class name so in most of the cases this is not something which will fit in as is in your programs or in your problems but in most of the cases this works so you find out the noun in your problem in my case it was Employee then you find out adjectives and they are going to going to be the attributes in most of the cases for example name age salary and then you find out the verbs and once you find out the verbs in your program get salary increment they will usually be the method so noun will map to the class name adjectives will map to the attribute names and verbs will actually map to the method names and this works in most of the cases this is this is a thumb rule this is not something that will you know work as is for all the problems this is not some sort of you know magical problem modeler you just simply look into this find out the nouns find out the adjectives find out the verbs and try to map this particular format in your problem let's talk about class attributes and uh a class attribute or rather an attribute that belongs to the class rather than a particular object is called class attribute in my case name is mapping to the class this is not unique for an object I'm creating I can create Harry I can create sham as another object and I can say Harry do marks sham. marks and they are going to work okay sham. name will also give me Harry okay but what if I want to set sham. name is equal to Sham I should be able to do that right but in this case I cannot do that because these three variables are actually part of this class and not part of this object so a class attribute is something that belongs to the class and it doesn't belong to the individual objects in this case class employee company is equal to Google this is specific to each class so even if you create an object called Harry or if you create an object called Rohan Harry do company or Rohan do compan is going to give you Google no matter what okay but you can actually change the class attribute so I can actually change the class attribute let's try to change the class attribute so in order to change the class attribute let me create another program class attributes py okay let's copy this code and let's paste it down so I have an object called Harry I have an object called sham I can print harry. name and I can also print sham. name so let me print sham. name print sham. name so if I print harry. name I'm going to get Harry if I'm going to print sham. name I'm going to get Harry again what if I want to change sham. name let me change it sham okay let me change it to Sham and if I do this what happens is this is going to set an instance variable for sham I'm going to explain to you what instance variable is but now if you print sham. name it is going to print sham let me show you so Harry Harry sham and if you and if you print harry. name it will show you Harry as you can see Harry Harry sham Harry okay now this particular thing is not changing the class attribute this is something that you need to remember and you might get confused at this but let me explain to you what instance attributes are and then we are going to be mapping class attributes with instance attributes and we'll understand both of these or rather the attributes concept together this is very important this is something that you need to listen to me so here if you want to change the class attribute you should not use object you need to add employee. compan is equal to YouTube and then this will change the class attribute let's talk about instance attribute and we'll come back to the class attributes what is an instance attribute an attribute that belongs to the instance and not to to the class is called instance attribute what is an instance instance is nothing but the object that we are creating in this case Harry is an instance sham is an instance okay so an attribute that belongs to the instance is the instance attribute assuming the class from the previous example so I created a class employee and I created a variable called company if I say harry. name is equal to Harry or Harry do salary is equal to 30k this is actually adding instance attributes so instance attribute is different from class attribute here what I did was here name was a class attribute let me write it here name is a class attribute and here when I'm saying sham. name is equal to Sham I'm actually setting an instance attribute I'm actually setting an instance attribute to Sham what is an instance attribute instance attribute is personal property of this object it is a personal property of this object it is not the property of a class but class attribute is personal property of a class and since this object is being instantiated from this class this will import all these things so this will get all these name marks and center from this class so when I say Harry is equal to employee and Sham is equal to employee I'm creating a very basic basic object out of class employee if I say harry. name the first thing it does is it tries to see or it looks up for instance attribute named name is there any instance attribute for Harry what is an instance attribute personal property of the object this particular object has no personal property called name the next thing it'll do is it'll say okay you don't have any personal property called name because it has never been set it will say let me look at the personal property of your parent class or rather your class the class that created you so employee created Harry Harry was created by this employee class and it had this name called name so it'll say okay you have a class attribute let me print that class attribute for you the same will go for this one but the moment I say sham. name is equal to Sham this will set an instance attribute to Sham now sham has a personal property called name this name is Shia's personal property and this is this employees personal property so the moment I say print sham. name the first question which will be asked to Sham is do you have a personal property called name sham will say yes I do have so what will happen is sham. name will actually print sham now the moment I say print harry. name the first question which will be asked to Harry is do you have a personal property called name no Harry doesn't have any personal property called name it will say okay let me go to your class and ask to that class the same question do you have any personal property the class will say yes I do have this name is equal to Harry it is my class attribute so this class attribute will be printed this is setting an instance attribute what if I want to set a class attribute what I can do is I can do something like this I can say employee. name is equal to ha renew okay the moment I do this this particular property which is a property of the class will change so from Harry it will change to Harry new and the moment I run this program I'll tell you what is being printed and why the moment I say print harry. name Harry didn't had any personal property at this point till this point Harry didn't had any personal property and Sham also didn't have any personal property so personal property of employee class will be printed which is Harry new Harry new Harry new but the moment the program reaches line number 16 sham has his personal property or the instance attribute called name now if I say sham. name sham will be printed and if I say harry. name this particular thing will be printed because Harry doesn't have any personal property or personal instance attribute or the attribute which is specific to Harry called name so employees name will be printed which is not Harry it was Harry until line number 10 but it was was changed to Harry new at line number 11 so Harry new will be printed once again I hope this is clear and if it is not I insist you watch the entire thing that I talked about this instance and class attributes once again you can rewind the video and watch it once again because this is something that I've explained in great detail now so coming back to the example from the notes I created a very basic class if I say employee. company is equal to YouTube it will change the class attribute if I say Harry do company is equal to something it will change Harry's personal thing or rather Harry's instance attribute okay you can try this out you can write few code and you will understand this instance attributes take preference over class attributes during assignment and retrieval this is something that you need to keep in mind if you say harry. name is equal to something else instance attribute will take preference and instance attribute will be set and not class attribute in order to set the class attribute you write something like this and let me write this comment setting a class attribute to employee for employee setting a class attribute for employee this is something we are doing here okay so har do attribute one is attribute one present in object is the first question which is asked is attribute one present in class as a second object which is asked so if you have an object called Harry and you're trying to print or you are you are trying to set attribute one the first question which is asked is it will say is attribute one present in object if yes it will be printed if it is not present in the object then it will be looked up in the class and that will be printed so first preference is always for instance attribute or the object's personal property then it will go to the class if you have your pen in your pocket you'll use that pen so first priority will be you are using your pen your own pen while giving your exam but if you fail to you know get a pen to the examination Hall in which case this is really very pathetic you should get your pen but for some reason if your pen doesn't work or you forgot the pan or somebody stole your pen uh while you were you know while you were about to write the exam the next preference is you'll ask your classmat you'll say hey class 2 do do you have another pen can you give me another piece of pen so that I can give my exam this should not happen you should always keep back a pen but I'm just giving you an example to it explain instance attributes and class attributes okay so this was really very easy and straightforward you you should not ask any more questions and if you have any more question I insist you to RND this video and watch this thing all over again this is really very simple and easy self parameter let's talk about self parameter self refers to the instance of the class so self parameter is something that we have already used so self dot something actually talks about the this particular object on which this method is being called let me explain this to you once again when I say harry. print obj self is actually Harry self is what self is actually Harry let me tell you what this harry. print obj is converted into this is actually converted into employee dot print obj hady this is something what this particular line means and let me show this to you let me run this for you and show you that these both things mean exactly the same thing so if you say har do print obj yes you can say that but this is as good as saying this and this actually explains why you need this self here I could have like I could have written self this and I could have written self this here as well and this would definitely work okay let me show you so self is not something that you need to use as is this is a good convention people are using self since a very long time this is another thing but when you are saying print obj uh or rather harry. print obj what you are basically saying is you are saying employee. print obj and that particular object so you can say harry. print obj or you can say employee. print obj Harry these two things are exactly the same and this is converted to this particular thing line number 18 which is why we need self here so Harry is passed as self to this method and this method will run and self will be this particular object this Harry object okay I hope I explained it to you very well okay so self refers to the instance of the class it is automatically passed with a function call from an object so if you say harry. salary it is equivalent to saying employee. get salary Harry I just showed this to you and here self is actually Harry so when you're passing this particular object to this particular method this object is passed to this method itself so the function get salary is defined as class employee company is equal to Google this particular thing and when you say Harry not get salary you're not saying harry. get salary you are basically saying employee do get salary Harry so you're saying go to the get salary method from employee class and pass Harry as self so now if you say self. company it will be Google okay so self. company will mean harry. company if you have changed harry. company then something else will be printed but if you run this method as this Harry doget salary this particular thing will be printed salary is not there whatever you want to print okay it will it will depend on the implementation let's talk about static method sometimes we need a function that doesn't use the self parameter we can define a static method like this you can use a static method decorator and what is a decorator decorator simply mark this method as a static method so when you are saying at theate static method you are simply saying that this method doesn't require any self and this method can be used can be used as is without any object okay let me show it to you and let me explain why we need static methods let's say you have a very complex class and all the methods of your class are using any object some of the other object okay so in this case print obj is using an object you might have something else you might have increment salary or something an increment salary might use the object so and in most of the cases it will definitely use the object because if you are saying Harry do increment salary you are basically incrementing salary of Harry so you need to perform some sort of operation on Harry object but sometimes what we need to do is we sometimes need to write some code where we are not doing doing anything with the object but rather we are doing some basic thing for example let us say I want to write a greed method and all I want to do is to say good morning that's all or rather good day not good daru good day now since this method is not using any object I can simply say at the rate static method and what I'm basically saying is I'm saying this method doesn't require any object so you you can call it using the object you can say Harry dogre or you can say employee. GRE both of these will work let me show it to you so the moment I run this program you can see good day good day is printed okay so this is called Static method in Python and you can actually Mark your static methods like this this is a decorator to Mark static methods I hope you got the point let's now talk about Constructors and Constructors are really very important things for a class they are a very important constituent of a class and you need to learn about Constructors and Constructor or rather underscore underscore init underscore underscore we call it Dunder init is a special method which is first run as soon as the object is created so the moment you instantiate your object this method is called and what you can do is set your instance variables using this Constructor so you can use underscore _ inore uncore which is a special method which is run for first run as soon as the object is created this method is also known as Constructor so you can call it Dunder in it if you call it underscore underscore in it underscore underscore this this is this is going to sound really very odd just call it Dunder in it it takes self argument and it also take further argument so let me show you an example and then we'll implement this in code for example if I have an employee class I can say self and the another thing that we can pass to this Dunder in it is name I can write self. name is equal to name and this will set name for this employee class this is a bit difficult to understand using just the theory so we are going to go to visual studio code and we'll implement this in code so let's go to visual studio code and write constructor. py I I I meant to write Constructor py and I'm going to create an employee class which I have already created I'm going to remove all this we have name is equal to this I'm going to get rid of all this and what I'm going to do is I'm going to say Def and I'm going to write Dunder in it okay uh I'm going to remove this I simply want to write this uh this particular Constructor I'll pass a name I'll pass another attribute as well which is going to be marks and I'll say self. name is equal to name is equal to name and same thing goes for Marks as well and now if I say Harry is equal to employee I can pass this name Harry and I can pass Harry's marks and now what I can do is I can can call this method harry. print obj and let me update this print obj I'm saying the name is this the marks is self. marks okay so this is something that we are interested in let's run this code the name is Harry Marx is 34 I can even create another object called Rohan and let's set rohan's marks to 994 ran is a good boy so he is actually scoring 94 marks let's see if this works so for Harry it prints the name is Harry the marks is 34 and for Rohan it prints name is Rohan marks is 94 you can have any number of attributes these are instance attributes I just want to point this out because these are not class attributes the the attributes that you are setting inside Constructor are instance attributes and something you write here will be class attribute so if you say name is equal to not known uh oops I need to write it as string if I say name is equal to not known or let me call center is equal to not known and if I print center self. Center this will actually print not known for Harry and for Rohan it's not known s marks is not known sorry Center I need to change this to Center Center is not known Center is not known Center is a class attribute these two are instance attributes these are class attributes the self. center for Harry and for Rohan because we have not set instance attributes which is named Center okay so this particular thing is being used the moment I create a center let me let me call this uh self. Center is equal to Center and I'll have to add this here Center so employee Harry 34 employee R I need to add a center let me say Center for Harry is Delhi and for Rohan it's Kolkata let me run this code now and you can see Center is Delhi Center is Kolkata because we have instance attribute sent this time coming back to the notes class employee I'm setting self. name is equal to name this is setting the instance attribute the name instance attribute and you can use harry. name to print that instance attribute okay so object can be instantiated using Constructor like this you can pass these values and the first thing that gets called is underscore uncore init or thunder in it or Constructor okay so this was a story of Constructor this was a story of classes and objects and I hope I was able to explain you classes and objects and in great detail now as part of The Next Step do one thing download all these notes these notes are really very important and valuable for you we'll go to the practice set and we'll see chapter 10 practice set and we'll see what sort of questions are mentioned there and what they have to offer for us chapter 10 practice set is going to be very important I want you to come to chapter 10 practice set and listen to all the questions or rather the techniques I use to solve those questions very very carefully let's move move on to chapter 10 practice set now let's now look into chapter number 10 practice set and yes oops is important which is why we are going to look into all these questions very very carefully and we are going to solve all these problems let's move to the first question but before that what I'm going to be doing is I'll open Visual Studio code and I'll be creating another file 05 pr01 py and let's solve this problem what does this problem say it says create a class programmer for storing information of few programmers working at Microsoft so I'll simply say programmer and we just have to store information about these programmers let's create a Constructor or uh let's not do that let's say that uh type uh language is equal to uh language what am I doing let's create a Constructor def uncore uncore in it okay so let let me tell something here and I just want to throw some light on this one see sometimes the question that your interviewer asks or even if it is asked in some exam it is quite vague and you just have to infer a few things if the question is vake instead of complaining about the question or criticizing the question or saying that the question is wrong all you have to do is you simply look into the question see what things you can assume and just proceed with the question if you're confident enough that question is missing something then you should definitely solve the question assuming what you think is missing you might be wrong you might be correct you might not understand the question altogether but in all these cases assuming few things which you think are missing I think that is the best deal that is the best you can do so you should always do that in this case it is not told whether you need to create a Constructor or not I just have to store information of few programmers I'm going to add name as well so name should be before language so I'll simply say name and let me type self. name is equal to name and let's instantiate few objects so what I'll do is I'll say Harry is equal to programmer not process Lo up error programmer and I'll enter the name so I'll say Harry I'll enter the language which is Python and I'll do the same for other programmers and you got the point uh you can add a method and you can do a lot of things okay so I'll say Java and I'll say print ran. name and I'll do the same thing for Harry as well and yes we are able to store the information about the programmers and that sols a question okay let's move on to the next question which says write a class calculator capable of finding square Cube and square root of a number so we need to write a class called calculator so let me create another file for this one pr02 py class calculator and once I do this what I'll do is I'll simply write three methods Square Cube and square root but before that what I'll do is I'll create a Constructor I'll say self. number is equal to number okay and I'll simply say number this is nothing but the return type and I just don't want to use it at this point but what I'll do is I'll create Square I'll say self and um after saying self what I'll do is I'll say return self. number MTI by self. number and this is a square same thing goes for cube as well I'll say self. number multiply by self. number multiply by self. number this is Cube and yes you can implement the same thing for square root as well so let's Implement square root as well in order to do that what I'll do is I'll create a method called square root let me make it camel case camel case means first letter of the word will be a small letter and remaining letters will be Capital so square root R will be Capital the S will be in lower case and if I if I was to enter the same thing in Pascal case I would have changed this s of square to upper case okay I hope that makes sense uh let's now Implement square root what I'll do is I'll import math class so math is a built-in module in Python if you know that I'll say return math dot sqrt not match math.sqrt self. number so we have square we have square root we have Cube let's try a few numbers I'll say 2 is equal to calculator to Let's Sprint two dot um let's print two do number then we'll print uh 2 do Cube let's print 2 do square and let's print sqrt I want you to tell me will these three lines line number 18 19 and 20 print Cube square and square root of these numbers or not just enter your answer in the comment sections as yes or no as plain yes or no I I don't want any explanation I just want you to tell me uh whether this will print the square Cube and sqrd or not I'll wait for your comments just put the time stamp of the video so that I can see your comment and just comment below whether it will print or not okay so spoiler alert I'm telling the answer it will not print Cube square and square root because I have not called the function yet so I need to use these parenthesis in order to call the function so I'll have to run this and it says okay so another reason why your answer should we know is that sqrt uh was spelled wrong okay anyways that was a minor one but you can see that uh cube of two has been printed square of two has been printed and Cube uh sorry square root of two has been printed you can try this out with other numbers as well and you got the point you have solved the question moving on to the third problem create a class with a class attribute a a will be the class attribute then it says create an object from it and set a directly using object. a is equal to Z the question says does this change the class attribute the answer is no it doesn't it doesn't change the class attribute because when I say object. A is equal to Z I'm basically adding an instance attribute I'm not changing the class attribute in order to change the class attribute I'll have to write the class name dot a is equal to Z that will change the class attribute so let's try this question out I'll say 07 uncore pr03 dopy and I'm going to create this class what is the name of the class it says create a class no name I I'll simply say my class I'll simply say a is equal to say Z or rather 9 and let's create an object of this class I'll say object is equal to my class then I'll say print obj DOA and what I'll do is I'll simply say obj do a is equal to0 this line will print 9 but this line will print zero because I have set an instance attribute let me write it down here I am setting an instance attribute by doing this okay this is something that you need to know let's run this code and you can see 9 and zero but this doesn't change the class attribute a class attribute is still nine so if I were to print my class. a this will print N9 and let me show this to you this is going to print 9 909 so this is something that should be crystal clear to you at this point because this is super important now coming to the next question add a static method in problem to to greet the user with hello and we have done this already we have done this while we were discussing objectoriented programming I want you to try this out on your own and definitely you will be able to do this question number five says write a class train which has methods to book a ticket get status and get Fair information of trains running under Indian railways okay so this this question sounds really really complicated but it is actually not complicated right class train which as methods to book a ticket so you can have class train let me solve this for you and prove that this is not a very difficult problem so I'll say p r0 I'm not sure I think it's six and it's not six uh it's five okay uh so let me change it to Five I'll change it to five P r5. py I'll simply say class trrain let's add a Constructor and let's add the methods so I should have the methods to book a ticket get the status and get Fair information so book ticket get status book ticket and get status are two methods so I'll say def book tickets and yes I need to write sell and get status def get status self and then um get status and then get Fair information so get Fair info pass okay let's do this book tickets get status get Fair info and the implementation will depend actually on what you are doing and how you are doing how I'm getting the fair information how I'm getting the status of the number of seats and how do I book The Ticket I should have some method to uh you know reach out to Indian Railway servers which is really very complicated so here what I what I'll do is I'll say seats is equal to 78 I've simply created a um or rather what I'll do is I'll not do this I'll create a self. seats is equal to 78 let us say there are 78 seats and once you book The Ticket what happens is self. seats is equal to a minus is equal to one okay so simply I'm decrementing one from the number of seats once you book a ticket or let me call it book ticket get status simply prints the seats print uh self. seeds and get Fair info I'll say print self. Fair okay and let me keep it simple let me let me say the cost of a ticket is 175 rupees and you can say uh TR is equal to 10 train and I'm not passing anything to the Constructor to keep things simple but you can always pass the seats and fair as variables you can do it yourself you can add seats and fair as parameters to in it and definitely it is going to work so TR is equal to train and what I'll do is I'll call tr. get Fair info this will simply print the fair and then I'll say TR uh dot get status and then TR do book ticket and then tr. get status not fair info I need to get status so why I'm uh calling this get status twice is because I want to check whether this is actually decrementing the number of seats or not let's call this and let's see the status so the get Fair info is printing 175 get status printing 78 because there are 78 seats I have booked the ticket so I have reserved one seat so now if I run get status I should actually see 77 I I should see the total number of seats minus one okay so this is how this works and we have solved this problem and this problem was easy wasn't it can you change the self parameter inside a class or something else say Harry try changing self to slf or Harry and see the effects I have already told you this you can change the self to slf you can change this self to Karina Kapoor you can change this self to Angelina Jolly you can change this self to Katrina CF you can change this self to Harry and this is not going to harm your program in any way provided that you are referring to the self inside this method as Harry so inside the inet I have to replace all the self with Harry and then it will work as expected let me save this code let me run this code 175 7877 so you can change yourself to Harry but it's not a good idea so I'm going to rward it back to self and this Sol a question so the answer to this question is yes you can you can change it to something else but you'll have to change it in the entire function and try changing it to the self to slf I've changed it to Harry you can try slf it will also work and the effects are nothing actually changes only thing is readability of your code reduces and we don't want that you can even use slf but SF is something that everybody uses and it makes your code readable because other code bases are using set and you are used to seeing this self written in the code and you should write self okay so I hope uh this answers all the questions and we have solved all these questions on objectoriented programming I hope you enjoyed this practice set so we'll now move on to the next chapter we'll look into some Advanced python stuff but before that we'll look into inheritance and we'll look into how these things work with object oriented programming concept so let's move move on to chapter number 11 now let's now move on to chapter number 11 now this is going to be fun because inheritance is one of the most important topics when it comes to Python and I feel that inheritance makes understanding of oops Concepts a lot easier because things starts making sense all of a sudden when you understand inheritance you'll understand more about objectoriented programming and it will help you a lot let's look into what inheritance actually is and then we'll look into more topics in objectoriented programming inheritance is a way of creating a new class from an existing class just like you are son of your parents or daughter of your parents in a very similar way a class can be a child class of a parent class that might sound weird to you but this is what it is for example you can have an employee and you can have all the methods and attributes inside a class named employee we call it a base class just like we call somebody parent when they have children we call a class as the base class and when we derive a new class from the base class what it means is the base class will give everything it has to the child class and child class will have some more things on its own let me explain this to you employees a class we have some code we have some implementations inside class employee what we'll do now is we'll create a class programmer we'll use the syntax we'll say class programmer inside the parenthesis we'll name the class employee and then we'll write some code here this is a derived class or child class now this thing might sound a bit strange at a first glance but let me tell you something once you start creating some child classes you'll get a hang of it so let's move ahead and create a child class from a parent class what I'll do is I'll close this folder from vs code and I'll open this particular folder so let me open this folder in code and let's create a first file child. py so we are going to use inheritance here let's write the code from my notes let's say class employee and I just want to say a is equal to say 34 and now what I'll do is I'll say class programmer I want to use employee and then what I'll do is I'll say B is equal to 34 now if I say PR is equal to programmer and if I say print pr. a and PR dob I will actually be able to print a as well as B so let me change this B to something else you can see that when I say pr. a 34 is printed when I say PR dob 32 is printed because the value of B is 32 here what you I try the same thing using the employee class what if I say em is equal to employee and then print em. a and EM dob if I say print em. a then yes you'll see 34 from here but if I say em dob there's no B in employee employee just have a single class variable which is a and you can see that this particular piece of code throws an error because employee doesn't have any B so it says attribute error employee object has no attribute B it is saying I don't know what B is what are you talking about okay so this is something that python interpreter is saying to us and I should get rid of this error and I should uh type a comment here just to tell you that this particular this line throws an error okay now if I run this program this line has been commented out so this will no longer throw an error I hope you understood how extending of classes using inheritance works so this is also called extending classes so I'm extending class programmer from class employee okay so this is something that you need to add to your vocabulary we can use the methods and attributes of employee in programmer object as we just saw I showed you a live demo of that also we can overwrite or add new attributes and methods in programmer class we can definitely do that we can definitely have some more methods here we'll get all the methods from employee plus the methods that we manually add here okay now there are three types of inheritance single inheritance multiple inheritance and multi-level inheritance in Python now single inheritance is the most straightforward form of inheritance it occurs when child class inherits only a single parent class so we have a base class we have a derived class and we are simply using using the base class to get the derived class and this is a classic example of single inheritance we have a class employee we have a class programmer we are using the employee class to create the class programmer and we are getting all the methods and properties of class employee in the class programmer we have already seen this in action we'll see another thing in action which is multiple inheritance multiple inheritance occurs when the child class inherit from more than one parent class let's say we have parent one we have parent two and we are creating a child class from these parent one and parent two we can even have a parent three and the syntax will definitely follow but let me create a file here multiple dopy and here I'm going to demonstrate multiple inheritance so let me create a class parent one and I need to use Pascal case I'll say a is equal to 4 and let's do the same thing for parent 2 and also for child so I'll say child we'll use parent one we'll use parent two and let me change this to parent 2 let me change this to B is equal to 2 let me change this to c is equal to 9 and yes if I say CH is equal to child and if I say print ch. a print print CH dob and print ch. C this will actually work because child is getting a from parent 1 B from parent 2 and C on its own okay so let me run this program for you and let me show you that this actually prints ch. a b and c uh I actually selected something and ran accidentally which is wi creaded temp code Runner file so I'll delete the stamp code Runner file I don't need it uh so sometimes when you select a piece of code and you run it it actually creates a temp Runner file and it puts the selected piece of code inside that temp code Runner file um and it executes it it's a bit annoying but but I'll just simply run this program from here you can see 42 and 9 has been printed because the value of a is 4 B is 2 and C is 9 pretty straightforward example isn't it let's come back to the notes we understood multiple inheritance it occurs when the child class inherits from more than one parent class let's now look into multi-level inheritance so when a child class becomes a parent for another class it simply causes multi-level inheritance let me explain this to you so we have a parent we have a child one we have a child two parent can be your grandpa child one can be your dad and child two can be you this is a very classic example of multi-level inher itens I'm just trying to explain it using some real word examples so let's create a file called multi. py and we'll copy everything from from here so we'll say C1 we'll say C2 or let me follow the notes parent child one child two I I I'll follow the note parent child one and child two so this is child one child one is actually using parent and child two will use child one so I'll create an object of child two and it should have access to a b and c let's run the code and you can see that it has access to a b and c if I create an object of child one it will not have access to C which is why this particular line will throw an error let me show this to you it says a child one has no attribute C but child one has an attribute B it has an attribute a it doesn't have an attribute C because it has never seen C is equal to 9 okay so let me revert it back to child two so that this this example actually works when you try to run it this is how multi-level inheritance works so this this was a basic example of uh single inheritance multi multiple inheritance multi- level inheritance so this is something that is used a lot in the industry people say use multiple inheritance to solve this problem or they simply say in between of a huge sentence they simply say that I am using multi-level inheritance to actually do this this and if you don't understand what multi-level inheritance means you might face trouble understanding what the other person is saying okay coming back to the notes where we left off super method what is the super method super method is used to access the methods of a super class in the derived class so let us say you have a derived class we have a base class now I want to call the Constructor of the base class so let me demonstrate this to you using a program I'll simply say 04 uncore super. py let me do one thing here I'll create Constructor for all of these um for all of these classes I'll say parent so we have a Constructor for parent we'll have a Constructor for child one uh oops child one we'll have a Constructor for child two and inside the Constructor all I'm doing is I'm simply printing child one child two as is so using a Constructor like this doesn't make any sense but I'm using it for the example sake so we have two Constructors uh sorry three Constructor for parent child one and child two let's run this code and see what happens so you can see that child two has been printed but no child one and parent has been printed what does this imply this simply implies that the Constructor of this particular class has been called and the Constructor of child one and parent is not called if you want to call the Constructor of child one from Child two what you can do is you can you can do something like this you can use a super keyword and after using the super keyword you can do something like this is and this will actually call The Constructor of child one as well so let me show this to you so the mistake that I've committed is I need to write it like this and now this will definitely work so if I run this child one Constructor of child one has been executed and the Constructor of Child 2 has also been executed so this was executing even before but now since we have added a call Super do in it this particular Constructor is also getting executed so if I add another call like this if I say super doore init if I do something like this Constructor of parent will also run so you can see child one parent child two this is the order in which these Constructors are getting called so first what happens is child two Constructor is being called but this particular function says that first you resolve this particular call and after you resolve this call then we'll print child to it say okay let me resolve this call while resolving this call it printed child one so child one has been printed so far now what happens is it says that before going back you have to resolve this call this call Simply returns parent uh sorry prints parent so this will print parent and then finally this child to is printed so just like a regular Python program this Python program uh or rather these set of statements are being executed okay so I hope you understood what super keyword does Super method is used to access the methods of a super class in the derived class and this simply calls a Constructor of the Base Class okay now what we are going to do is we are going to understand what class methods are and why we need class methods okay so let me give an overview to you and then we'll see what is written in the notes so when you are using some class attributes and what you're essentially doing is you are simply altering or playing around with those class attributes you don't need the object upon which that particular method is being called all all you need is the name of the class okay in order to use or rather implement this effectively we use class methods so let's come to the notes and see what class methods has to say a class method is a method which is bound to the class and not the object of the class so this particular method is bound to the class and it's not bound to the object of the class it has nothing to do with the object it has to do with the class so we are using the class attributes when we are implementing the class methods this is a decorator that is used in Python at theate class method this decorator is used to create a class method and this decorator can essentially Mark your method as a class method let's write a class method and let's write the syntax of class method I have added syntax of this class method inside the notes just so that when you come back to these notes after say 3 months or 4 months or 10 months you should have a clear-cut idea of what this class method is and how the syntax of class method looks like so let's create a program 05 uncore class method. py and what we'll do is we'll say um class employee and what I'm going to do is I'm going to say a is equal 1 B is equal 4 and C is equal six a B and C are class attributes a b and c have nothing to do with any object now what I'll do is I'll add a decorator class method no space simply the class method I'll say CLS method and the first thing that I pass is CLS and then I'm going to pass a b and c now what I'll do is I'll simply say cs. a is equal to a and the same thing for B and C so I'm going to say CLS dot uh B is equal to B and CLS do C is equal to C okay now if I instantiate an object from this class I say EMP is equal to employee and if I say EMP do CLS method or rather I want to call it set attribute I want to call it this because it is essentially setting the attributes and I say 1 2 3 this should set my attributes a b and c to 1 2 and 3 so now if I print employee do a employee. b and employee. c it should give me 1 2 and 3 instead of 1 or rather 10 4 and six so let me make this B I'll make this C and I'll print these a b and c values before calling this method as well okay so I'm calling these um I'm printing these attributes before calling this method as well so 10 4 and six and now they are 1 2 and 3 why did I use the class name and not the EMP which is the object name because I wanted to show you that A B and C are properties of class and not of the objects so we are essentially changing the class attributes and not the instance attributes so this is something that you need to keep in your mind moving forward let's talk about property decorators so I'll say 06 unor property and I'll simply say property. py and I'll copy this particular thing and paste it here and now what I'll do is I'll simply say property and I'll say dep I'll say length and I'll simply say [Music] return self. a and let me call it self now if I use this property decorator what happens is instead of calling it as a function I can directly call it as a property let's read about property decorators consider the following class this is an employee class we have a name function and we have a decorator property decorator just above the name of the function or the definition of the function if I say if e is equal to employee is an object of class employee we can print e.name to print the eame variable let me show this to you and let me show this to you using my example in this case if I want to print name I'll have to or rather length I have this length as the name of my method if I don't have this property decorator I'll have to do something like this let me remove this let me remove this as well and let me say print I'll say EMP do Len length I'll have to do something like this if I run this one is printed because I'm calling this function length is a function but what if I want to use this length as a property I don't want to use these extra parenthesis if I do this directly without the property decorator you can see that it simply prints this bound method employee do length of this particular object at this particular location I don't want to see this but what I want to see is I want to see one so to accomplish this what we do is we use this property decorator and this property def length self return self. a if I run this code you can see that uh one has been printed so this is something um that you should understand and you should know how this works okay so I hope you understood how property decorators work in a very similar way we have Getters and Setters in Python and how Getters and Setters work the method name with property decorator is called Getters so we already know what getter is now let's talk about Setter so let let us say you want to set some value okay uh we can define a function plus adate name do Setter decorator like below so we have a name do Setter and we have a function called name so what this particular function essentially is doing is this will set the value of this name property let me explain this to you so since I have this length as a property what I'll simply do is I'll say at the rate of I'll say length dot Setter now what I'll do is I'll simply write this function length I'll say def length as we have name here we'll use length here because we are creating a seter for length I'll simply say self and I'll say value and I'll simply say self. a is equal to Value this is something that I'm doing now what I'll do is if I say EMP do length is equal to 78 and run this program you can see initially the length was one but now I can directly say EMP do length is equal to 78 can you do this without the setter or rather name dot Setter decorator no you you cannot do that why because length deep within this class employee is a method it's not an attribute but here it looks like an attribute it simply looks like an attribute you can see we are printing EMP do length it seems as if there is a length attribute defined inside this class but actually length attribute is not defined inside this class it is a function with property decorator which is making it appear like this but what if I want to directly say EMP do length I'll have to write this syntax which is a Setter and I can add or create a Setter for this length property and length property will now have a Setter and I can directly say em. length is equal to 78 if I get rid of this this syntax is no longer valid because EMP do length is equal to 78 doesn't make any sense length is a method you cannot say that method is equal to a number this doesn't make any sense but with the help of this set a decorator all of this makes sense and you can actually set this particular length to 78 and deep inside what it will do is it will set the value of your a to the value that you are providing in this case 78 I hope you got the gist of it you got how and why we are using all these things let's not talk about operator overloading in Python and this is fun let me tell you this is fun why is this fun because you'll enjoy doing this I'll tell you why operators in Python can be overloaded using Dunder methods so we have something called Dunder methods operators in Python can be overloaded using these Dunder methods so far we have seen Dunder in it we'll see some other Dunder methods these these methods are called when a given operator is used on the objects and definitely I'll I'll be giving you plenty of examples to support the text written in this notes so operators in bython can be overloaded using the following methods so p1+ P2 you can override the default property of this plus Operator by using this method so I'll show you how so what I so what I'll do is I'll simply say um Dunder method py and let me simply say a is equal to 45 B is equal to uh 48 okay or rather let me make it 40 so a is 45 B is 40 if I print a + b this will simply print 85 and yes it makes sense 45 + 40 is 85 okay now let us say I want to add two objects let me show this example to you let me create a class let me call this employee and let me say a is equal to 45 and um or rather let me create a Constructor I'll say self. a is equal to a and I'll pass this a here so I'm passing this a here and I'll create an employee object I'll say employee 45 then I'll say employee 40 okay employee 40 employee 45 employee 40 if I say a plus b let me show you what happens it says unsupported operant of types employee and employee it's it's basically telling me that you don't have a Dunder add method here so if I add an add method like this what I can do is return self. a plus obj do a and what is the obj object it is the object which upon which this particular operation is being operated okay so I have some endent error here let me fix that endent error and now if I run this code you can see 85 has been printed because I have defined what happens when I use this plus symbol okay so this is something that you should keep in your mind while you are creating objects and using these kinds of operators on your objects okay so P1 plus P2 if you want to implement this you need to ment this method if you want to implement this uh subtract sign if you want to make it work you need to implement this if you want to make this work you need to implement this if you want to make if you want to make this work you need to implement this for double slash you need to implement this okay I hope all this makes sense now there are some other dund or magic methods in Python Str Str is used to set what gets displayed upon calling this particular method St Str obj now Len this particular thing is used to set what gets displayed upon calling this method itself or Len of obj for example let me show this to you let us say I want to add this ther St Str and I want to Simply return self. name and let me add a name here as well self. name is equal to name is something that I'm going to write and I'm using alt click to get multiple cursors in vs code okay I know a lot of you will ask me in the comments and also let me say Harry and let me say Rohan and if I use print a and print b or rather let me call this like this print a comma B you'll see Harry and Rohan what if I don't have this St strr method what will happen if I don't have this Str Str method I'll get something I'll get this main. employee obj at this location main. employe obj at this location but if I want to see the name of the person who is being printed I need to use this St Str and the same is the case with Len let us say length of an employee is the salary of that employee I know it doesn't make any sense but let me return self. a when the Len object is or rather Len function is called so so if I say print Len of a and print Len of B I should see 45 and 40 printed on the screen so Len of a is 45 L of B is 40 if you're modeling real word thing using classes and objects you'll use something meaningful you'll you you'll print something meaningful while your object is being printed for example when an employee is being printed I printed the name and not the salary or a or the increment if you want to know who is whom you you'll know the name you want to know the name name of that person and not the employee code or something else uh in a very similar fashion if you want to implement this add method you'll add something meaningful from the two objects for example in the case of complex numbers or in the case of vectors we actually add the corresponding axis uh in the vectors and also if you're are adding two complex numbers you'll uh add the real numbers with real numbers and complex numbers with complex numbers ignore it if it doesn't make any sense if you don't know what complex numbers uh numbers are I basically want to say is whatever you are modeling using classes and objects should be meaningful in your production code in your serious code whatever I have implemented here is simply to explain you how these things are working but when you go in production when you go in some company when you are writing some meaningful code you should put the readability first you should keep in mind the readability of the code you should keep in mind what you are doing and what overall purpose purpose your code is serving and all those things so now we'll move on to chapter number 11 practice set and we'll talk more about all these Concepts which we have learned in this chapter I hope you enjoyed this objectoriented programming chapter and I hope that you now know how objectoriented programming Works let's move on to chapter 11 practice set now let's now move on to practice set of chapter number 11 so what I'll be doing is I'll open this practice set of chapter number 11 and let's move towards the first question so it says that create a class c2d vector and use it to create another class representing a 3D Vector so what we are going to do here is let me close all these programs which are open and let me write 08 uncore uh p1. py so I'll write a class called Vector 2D and we have to create a class vector 3D using this Vector 2D but here what I'll do is I'll simply write the Constructor and um I'll say self do I is equal to I and self do J is equal to J so what is i j and key I is the x axis J is the Y AIS and K is the Zed axis in a 2d Vector we have I and J and in a 3D Vector we have uh K as well which is the third dimension so here we have just two two dimensions in order to create a vector 3D using this Vector 2D what I'll do is I'll simply name this class as Vector 3D and I'll use Vector 2D as the parent class of vector 3D now what do I write inside the Constructor I'll simply say self. k equal to K and what about I and J let me pass K as well I'll simply say super Dot super dot in [Applause] it and I'll pass I and J so this is how all these things work let's now try to instantiate objects using this so I'll say V2 is equal to Vector 2D and I'll say 1 comma 5 and then I'll say Vector 3D and then I'll say 1 5 and n and let's see if these work or not so it says it takes three position AR arents but for was given I don't have to write the self here my bad so sometimes I don't remember syntax but that doesn't mean that you don't know some at times you might not remember syntax and that's totally fine so we are able to create V2 and V3 and now let me create another function called print I'll say def print vector and what print Vector does is um let me say sare it will simply print the vector as IAP J cap and key capap so what I'll do is I'll print an F string I'll say F and what I'll do is I'll say self. I self do I I'll simply say self. I and then I'll say plus then I'll write J and then I'll write K but for a 2d Vector it's going to be J and I only there's no K but what if we have a 3D Vector when we have a 3D vector we'll do is we'll use Kap as well so we'll say self. II and then we'll have Kap as spell so if I say v2. print vector and if I say v3. print Vector you can see that we have 15 and then 159 uh you can even say 1159 and I think I need to add some spaces near plus just to make it a bit more readable but that upon you that's totally fine even if you don't put the spaces this is going to work so this is how this Vector is working and we are able to represent a 2d Vector as well as a 3D Vector in Python let's move on to question number two which says that create a class pets from a class animals and further create class dog from pets add a method back to class dog and this is a straightforward question uh I want you to try this out you have to create a class pets from a class any anal so create a class animals first then create a class pets make p as capital and further cre a class dog from pets so PP will be Capital here I I have made a mistake while uh writing this down add a method back to class do and just simply add a method called B and simply print b or something or bow bow or something inside that b method so this is super simple you can do this create a class employee and and add salary and increment properties to it write a method salary after increment with a property decorator with a Setter which changes the value of the increment based on the salary sounds complicated right it's actually very simple and I'm going to implement uh and show this to you so this is problem number three I'll say 09 uncore pr03 py and I'm going to write this class employee so the question says that you have to write a class employee add salary and increment properties so what I'll do is I'll create a construct and I'll say self. salary is equal to salary and then I'll say self. increment is equal to increment okay so we are going to say salary and then increment so we have these two methods um sorry these two properties and now what I'll do is I'll say emp1 is an employee with a salary of 12,000 rupees and an increment of uh say 10% so I'll say 0.0 0.1 okay so 10% increment and 12,000 rupees salary now what I'll do is uh I'll create this method salary after increment so let me create this method so I'll say salary after increment okay now this is a property so I'll put a property decorator so this is a property decorator and I'll simply say self and I'll say return self do salary plus or rather multiply by 1.1 do you know how this 1.1 is coming where is this coming from this is simply coming from 1+ 0.1 which is the increment or rather I'll not I I'll not write it like like this because the increment might change uh increment is 0.1 in this case my bad I can't H hardcode it here so what I'll do is I'll say 1 plus self. uh increment okay so this this is how it works so this will return salary after the increment so this is a property and I can simply say print emp1 do salary after increment and yes this is going to print salary after increment as you can see this is the salary after increment if I make it 1 lakh or if I make it 10,000 it should be 11,000 as you can see so 10% increment every year okay so what I'll do now is I'll add a property decorator and I've already added the property decorator by the way I'll add a Setter and how do you add the setter we have already seen it here and let me tell you where we learned about Setter we learned about the setter here so what I told you was you write the name of the property do Setter so we are going to do the same thing we are going to say add salary after increment do setup and now we'll write the same function we'll say self. salary is equal to self do salary is equal to self. salary multip by this so we are updating the salary so now if I say that emp1 do uh salary after increment is equal to something let us say I want to set the salary after increment to 11,000 it should change my increment or rather it should change my salary to this thing so this is a very basic implementation of this and this can be used to set the properties so this is how we solve this question uh I'll save this program we'll move on to the next question now write a class complex to represent complex numbers along with overloaded operators so we can represent a class complex to represent complex numbers with plus and multiply operator which adds and multiplies them so what we can do is we can simply write a class and let me write a program I'll say 10 uncore p010 10or p054b this is problem number four ID I said is I'll write a class complex representing complex numbers and I'll write a Constructor here I'll say self. a is equal to a and self dob is equal to B and we'll add a and b here so A and B I'll simply say that def uh underscore uncore add this is a add Dunder method with an object so what I'll do is I'll say self. a plus self dob I'll say return uh complex I'll return a complex number with self. A+ oj. a and I'll explain this to you don't worry OB self DOB plus obj dob what am I doing here you must be thinking what am I doing here uh I I need to write selfir now what I'll do is I'll say C1 is a complex number C1 is a complex number with 1 and four as real and imaginary values and C2 is a complex number now I want to print C1 + C2 or rather I can say C3 is equal to C1 do C2 I'll say C3 is equal to c1c2 and I can print C3 do a and C3 dob and then from there we can see if this addition works so if I run this program you can see that 11 and one has been added four and three has been added let me now explain this to you so every complex number has a real part and an imaginary part so this is the real part this is the imaginary part so we are creating the complex number using A and B where a is the real part and is the imaginary part so when we add two complex numbers we add their real parts and add their imaginary parts and construct another complex number out of those real parts and imaginary parts so real part of uh of this particular object which is say C1 is self. a for another object it is obj a and since I'm adding these two things I'll put the real part and imaginary part like this because my constru structor of complex takes the real part and imaginary part to construct the complex number and I'm returning that complex number so C3 is a complex number now for that complex number I can print the values of A and B which I might which I'm already doing and you can see that C1 do sorry C3 do a is 12 and C3 dob is 7 which makes total sense I hope you got it and I hope this is very clear to you so this is how we can add and when it comes to multiplying let me Google it multiplying two complex numbers so multiplication of complex number is a bit tricky but again I'm going to pull the formula out of some article and we are going to directly Implement that formula if you are into maths or you want to learn more about complex numbers you can look into all these things but for the sake of this tutorials we are not going to discuss complex numbers anymore so if P plus IQ is a complex number and r+ I is another comp complex number so Z1 multip by Z2 is this particular thing so you can implement this formula and this is the real part and this is the imaginary part you can implement this and uh write your multiplication function I've already told you which Dunder method to use for multiply it's called mul Dunder method you can use this Dunder method and you are good to go now let's talk about the next question write a class Vector representing a vector of n Dimension overload the plus and star operator which calculates a sum and Dot product of them so you can have a vector just like we created a vector class in the question number one and you can overload these methods the ad method and mul method I hope you'll do it now write the stdr method to print the vector as follows we have already uh done this so what I'll do is I'll solve this problem for you so this is problem number six 11 uncore pr06 py and I'm going to copy the code I've written in problem number one now what I'll have to do is I'll have to write I'll have to write an Str Str function so what I'm doing is I'm simply writing Str Str function and what am I returning I'll be printing this I'll be printing this or or rather I'll return this string I'll return this F string so I'll say return this F string self. I IAP self. JJ capap self. KK capap and let's get rid of this print Vector function let's say assume it's not there now if I print my V3 I'll see this particular thing let me see if it works and yes it does 11 5 and 9 so this is how you can Implement Dunder SDR to print your vector beautifully okay so there's another question here question number seven it says overwrite the alien method on Vector of problem five to display the dimension of the vector so you can simply override the method Len to calculate the dimension of the vector in this case this is three so if you have solved problem number five which simply says that uh write a class Vector representing a vector of n dimension in this case you'll have to create a list to represent the vector you'll have to write this particular method to find out the length of that list I think we need to solve this question so initially I thought of not solving this question but let me solve this question for you uh if you want to skip this question or if you have already solved this question you can skip it but I'm I'm going to solve this for you because I think this will be an important question so we have to represent a vector of n Dimension so I'll say class Vector now what I'll do is I'll simply create a Constructor this will have a list L1 which will contain the list of all the um all the values all the N values simple L s.n is equal to Len of L1 this is the dimension of the vector or rather let me call it Dimension cell do dem is equal to Len of vector and we have already stored it in a list okay now what I'll do is I'll overlo overload the plus and star operator which calculat sum and dotproduct of these two vectors so in order to create the sum uh in order to calculate the sum of this Vector what I'll do is I'll write this method add and it will be added to another Vector I'll simply say return generate a vector by using this list but what is the what is this my list my list is equal to obj dot um data let me say self. data is equal to L1 I'll say obj do data Plus self. data so we are adding these two lists so I need to pass s here and what I'm doing is I'm creating a vector out of this my list now what I'll do is I'll simply say V1 is equal to vector and I'll say 1 2 3 and then I'll say V2 is equal to Vector 11 12 13 now I'll say print V1 + V2 so once I do this let me see if it works it says in It Takes Two position arguments but four were given which is wrong so I need to give only one positional argument here because I need to pass a list to my Vector let me run this program now and it should work so it says mean Vector so V3 is a vector let me call V3 as V1 + vs2 and let me say V3 dot data and let let's see if we get this data or not so v3. data is 11 12 13 1 2 3 so we we we need to add the uh list items one by one so what I'll do is I'll use a fall Loop I'll simply say for item in my list or for I in range of length of my list so what I'm doing is what I'm doing is I'm simply saying that for I in range of length of obj data sorry not my lest so what I'm doing doing is the first Vector I'm taking the length of the first vector and I'm starting from zero and going all the way till length of this Vector minus one so basically I'm iterating through this list using the index I will be 0 1 2 3 4 5 so in this case I will be 0 1 and two now what I'll do is I'll say my list. append I'll simply use this obj do dat I let me use multic cursor functionality and and this is going to be simple I hope you understand this part my list or append this and I'll get rid of this I I'll I'll make this an empty list and this should work so if I run my code 12 14 and 16 has been printed 11 + 1 12 + 2 13 + 3 so I'm adding the items of the list one by one so 12 will be 11 will be added to 1 12 will be added to 2 13 will be added to three so my V3 will be 12 14 and 16 so this is my V3 I hope you understood how we are adding these two vectors uh so we have already created a method to add two vectors now we'll do the same thing for multiplying two vectors and this is going to be easy and why do I say that I'm saying that because here we need to find the dot product of two vectors which is going to be simple so what I'll do is I'll use the same Loop but instead of doing this what I'll do is I'll say dot is equal to Z and instead of appending this to a list what I'll do is I'll multiply these two values and I'll add these two values to what to dot so dot is equal to or rather dot plus is equal to this this particular thing and finally I'll return dot so this is how we find the dot product of a vector if you don't know vector algebra this might sound a bit difficult for you but let me tell you something I'll say V4 is equal to V1 * V uh V2 and make sure that V4 is not a vector let me write it down V4 is a scalar and not a vector dot product of two vectors is a scalar and not a vector V4 is uh scaler okay so this is something that you need to understand and if I print V4 I'll simply print the value of V4 it is going to be a single value so let me see if this value 74 is coming out to be correct so 11 + 24 + 39 so 11 + 24 + 39 and this should come out to be 74 which is correct so this do product is correct I hope you understood the techniques I hope you understood how I have implemented all this I wanted to solve this problem number five for you because for some of you guys this might have gotten trickier so if you're not into vector algebra and you didn't understand this that's totally fine you need to learn vector algebra first uh and then understand this but if you're not into vector algebra or you are not going to code vector algebra in your life ever you don't even have to bother about this um so these were my two sents about vector algebra whether you should learn it or not if you think that this is important for you or for your career path you can learn otherwise that's totally fine you can ignore it and you can move ahead to chapter number 12 where we are going to uh learn about Advanced python stuff but let's look at this question number seven as well what what is it saying it says that overwrite the Len method on Vector of problem five to display the dimension of the vector and this is going to be super simple all you need to do is you need to say Len and just return length of self. data we already have this Dimension but again let's not use the self dodim let's calculate it when somebody uh runs this l n so if I say print Len of V3 let's see what gets printed on the screen three is being printed on the screen which is fine so we have solved the question number seven as well so I hope you understood how these things are working how objectoriented programming Works how we create classes how we use inheritance to create classes I hope everything is clear and I hope you like these notes make sure you download these notes because I have put in a lot of hardware work to create these notes for you so you should not take this for granted definitely download the notes and you know watch this video completely and mark the parts of the video where you think that you might need to come back in the future you can you can do that by posting a comment below of the time stamp uh let's move on to chapter 12 now where we'll talk about some Advanced python stuff and chapter 12 and 13 are going to definitely help you a lot so let's move to chapter 12 now so now we are going to start Advanced python 1 wherein we'll cover some of the topics which are usually not under any broader topic so uh these topics are not really very difficult to understand do not take this word Advanced for difficult python it's not difficult python it's straightforward these are some of the topics in Python that you need to know definitely and they will save a lot of your time so let's get started let's talk about exception handling in Python there are many built-in exceptions which are raised in py when something goes wrong for example let us say you are running the code and your code is actually talking to a server what if that server goes down what if you're talking to an API and there is some problem from their end not from your end what will you do you you cannot do anything because your code will definitely throw some error if their API is down if the code doesn't work as expected your users might suffer or your program might just crash in order to save your program from crashing what we do is we use try accept so the syntax of try accept looks something like this but let's talk a bit more about exceptions what exactly is an exception and what is a python Tri block so there are many built-in exceptions buil-in exception means that some broader category of problem which occurred so exception is some sort of problem which might occur which was unexpected for example let us say you are running a code and you expected user to enter an integer and instead of of that integer the user entered a string what will you do you cannot do anything about it and your program might crash so uh you can throw an exception from your program and save your program from crashing we'll see how so there are many built-in exceptions we'll talk about those built-in exceptions exception is an object in Python we'll talk about that object and you can raise those exceptions when something goes wrong exceptions in byon can be handled using a tri statement the code that handles the exception is written in the accept Clause so if you are writing some code which should execute when that problem occurs it should be written inside the accept Clause let's look into the syntax of try accept as you can see that I have opened my visual studio code on this folder I'm going to create my first program and I'm going to name it triy accept. py so let me call it TR accept. py now what I'll do is I'll simply say try and I'll say print hello word now this particular piece of code is not going to throw any error and then what we do is we say accept exception as e and we print the exception now let us say what I'm doing is I'm saying a is equal to int input and then we'll say enter a number now we'll do the same thing with B enter another number and now what I'll do is I'll simply say print A+ B what do you think will happen if I run this code I can enter first number 3 8 and yes 3 + 8 is 11 it works as expected but what if I say Harry it says invalid literal for INT with base 10 now as you can see that this is not printed as an error we our program encountered no error and if we were to print something let us say if I print something like this if I say uh there was no errors there were no errors let me fix it so there were no errors if I run this code it's asking me for a number and if I enter something which is not a valid integer or number you can see that there were no errors has been printed after the error message now let's try to understand it by removing this try block and accept block and see what happens when we have no try and accept block so I'm getting rid of these try and except blocks so I'll get rid of this except block I'll get rid of this Tri block and I'll try to execute this code and I'll try to do the same thing I'll say Harry and you can see the program gets halted there itself on this line so you are not going to see any of the statements executed after line number four because line number four throws an error line number four tells the program or tells the python interpreter that hey we have encountered some problem please stop right away so you will not see this there were no problems or there were no errors printed on the console because this line is never executed let's now bring back a tri block and accept Block in the presence of Tri block we are actually handling the exception and while we are handling the exception we are simply printing that exception let me change this by saying that this problem occurred and what I'll do is I'll simply print this e as an F string so this is what I'm doing let me cancel the execution of this program let me run this program once again I'll say 8 I'll say 9 8 + 9 is 17 there were no errors but if I say 78 and if I say Harry you can see the problem occurred or rather I should say this problem occurred so this problem has occurred and our Python program is printing it how does it print it it is printing it inside the accept block so whenever there is a problem in the tri block except block will be executed and when except block is executed any line after that except block will be executed as well so this is something that comes in very handy when you have a lot of lines waiting to get executed after this so let us say this program contains say 110 lines if we encounter an error during the first 10 lines then it will be very problematic for us we don't want that in order to get rid of those problems we are using this try accept so this is how TR accept works when the exception is handled the code flow continues without program Interruption which is why you see this particular print statement getting executed now we can also specify the exceptions to catch like below so you can catch specific exceptions for example the specific error that we encountered while we wrote Harry in place of integer was a value error so we can catch value error only using a special accept statement we can say value error occurred so let me show this to you we'll say accept value error and we'll simply say value error occurred so this is something we can do and you can see the syntax of this here we can uh catch the zero division error we can catch the type error we can catch other types of exceptions and let me run this code for you and show you that this block will be executed so if I say Harry you can say value error occurred there were no errors there were no errors because we handled the exception so this block will be executed because value error occurred sometimes what happens is let us say I'm dividing two numbers uh so let us say instead of a plus b I'm saying a divided by B now whenever I'm entering a value which is not an integer I'll encounter a value error but if I enter b as Z that will be zero division error because you cannot divide by zero so let me run this code and let me say first number is five second number is zero and you can see this problem occurred division by zero so it checks whether this is a value error or not no this is not a value error so this block will not be executed the next thing it checks is whether it is some other kind of exception or not so any other exception will execute this particular line what if I write accept zero division error and if I print and I say this is a zero division error what will happen if I do something like this and yes you guessed it right if I say six and zero I'll see this particular line getting executed because I have written a block for zero division error and what if I enter some invalid value for for integer it will simply execute this block because value error has been encountered and value error will be catched using this block so I hope you understand OD how we can specify the exceptions we want to catch and I have entered this Syntax for you in my notes because I want you guys to take this notes and I want you guys to print these notes and take them with yourself so this is something which will help you a lot uh all the other exceptions will be handled here uh so let's talk about raising exceptions how you can create your custom exceptions and you can raise them in Python we can raise custom exceptions using the raise keyword in Python and I'll show you how you can raise custom exceptions so uh what you can do is you can simply say if B is greater than 199 I can say raise or uh I can simply say raise exception and I can say this number is too large now if I run this code and if I enter something which is greater than 199 you can see that it tells me this problem occurred this number is too large so we can raise the exceptions and we can make programs stop before it's too late so let us say this value is not valid for this program I don't want my user to suffer some other consequences I will stop my user right away I'll tell him or her that this particular value is too large to handle for us and we don't want you to proceed with the program so this program will be halted right at light number six instead of making user wait for some other statements to be executed and you know U instead of wasting users time in executing some other lines of code we want to stop the user early so this is something that you can do using the race keyword so this was race keyword in Python now there is a syntax for try with else Clause sometimes you want to run a piece of code when try was successful so whenever try is successful else will be executed so this else will be executed only if the try was successful I'll demonstrate this for you so if I write else and if I print try was successful you'll see that this will be executed only when no exception occurs so if I say 37 it says try was successful but if I say Harry it will not say triable successful if I say three and zero it it will not say Tri was successful if I say uh 4 and 8888 it will not say Tri was successful it will only say try was successful when try was actually successful so this is something that you need to remember whenever try is successful else will be executed otherwise else will not be executed with try do not confuse this else with if else this is not related to if else this is n else with try and this is a part of python synx so you can use else with tri block I have made it really very clear in the notes so if you download these notes this is going to be the best resource for you whenever it comes to revising python now let's talk about try with finally uh just like we talked about else with if else with try we have another blog called finally so whenever you have something to try and then you have something to accept there is a Blog called finally which is executed regardless of what happens so this will be executed regardless of what happens I'll tell you what it means so python offers a finally clause which ensures execution of a piece of code irrespective of the exception so let me demonstrate finally using another program I'll say 02 unor finally. py so let's let me try this let me say a is equal to 8 B B is equal to Z and as we as we know that this is going to throw an error uh let me copy this from here let me copy this as well I think I think we can reuse this piece of code so I'm printing a divided by B and we are saying this problem occurred and we don't want to use else but we want to use finally and I'll say I will always be executed I will always be executed so this will always be executed let's see if this is true so when we have this tribe block successful this is executed what if there is an error what happens if there is an error this is executed now there is something that people get confused with and I'm going to explain and make clear um that particular Point what if we have this finally what's the use of this finally a lot of people ask me that what is the use of this finally when we can do something like this instead of writing this we can always do this and this will always be executed because we are handling the exception then what is a use of this finally there's no use of this finally but I'll tell you the use of this finally despite exceptions being handled let us say we have a function let me wrap this inside a function I'll say function and let me make this part of a function now I'll simply say function now let us say I'm returning this value I'm returning a by B and here when the problem occurs I'm returning say zero now if I do something like this this statement is not reachable you can see code is unreachable and if you want me to prove this I can prove this I'll say six I'll say nine and you can see I will always be executed as not printed but with finally this is not the case if I if I run this piece of code if I say six and if I say nine you can see I will always be executed even if there is some exception this is always executed so we are returning from the function despite of us returning from the function this finally is executed so this finally will always be executed it will not obey the function being returned or something it will always be executed so this is really very useful and this is the purpose of finally you need to use fin to clean up some resources let us say you have some files open and some exception occurred uh so regardless of whether the exception occurred or not you you would definitely want to close that file so you can use this finally Clause to close the file or do the cleanups or let us say if you have made connection to a database you need to successfully close the connection to the database you can use finally block to do that I hope I made it clear for you and this example is going to be very important whoever tells you that finally has no use use you can always use something like this you can show them this example and they'll know what is a use of finally so if name equals to equals to name in Python let's talk about this so you must have seen this particular thing a lot if underscore uncore name equals to equals to underscore uncore main we actually call it Dunder name and Dunder main so let me call this main okay I'm I'm simply printing this if I run this code you'll see enter a number let's say five let's say nine and this main is printed because we are using this but what is the use of this if name equals to equals to meain if I put this function as well inside this you can see that the same thing is happening um there's there's no change in the program but let me tell you something you'll see the difference when you import this module let me import this uh name name py so what I'll do is I'll simply say import 02 and let me call this a02 finally just to make this name valid so I'll say a2core finally and this has been imported now if I import this and if I run this program you'll see nothing is happening as you can see nothing is happening here because I'm just importing this a2core finally module what if I don't have this name equals to equals to main let me let me show you and now run 3core namore main just listen to me very very carefully you can see that this program is getting executed did you see that did you see that this is executing because when I'm importing this it's literally taking this file and putting it here now here if I have this if name equals to equals to main what exactly happens is that name will evaluate to which file we are in so if we are in the same file underscore uncore name is evaluated to main so let me print underscore uncore name for you so if I print underscore uncore name for you and run this code make sure that I'm running a02 finally. py you can see that it is main so name Dunder name I should say Dunder name is underscore uncore maincore uncore when we are in the same file so we are in the same file which is why the underscore uncore name is this but if I run this code from some other file you can see it evaluates to the name of the module evaluates to the name of this module and not underscore uncore main so if name is equals to main means that if we are in the same module if we are in the same module and if we are running this from the same module then do this so if you are running this file then this will be executed but if you are importing this file this will not be executed I I want you to write down these words I want you to write down whatever I'm saying if underscore uncore name equals to equals to underscore uncore main if Dunder name equals to equals to Dunder main will evaluate to true if we are in the same module if we are running the file from the same module if we are running this particular file but if we are not running this file or if we are importing this a02 file then underscore uncore name will be name of this file and it will not be underscore uncore Main and this thing will not evaluate to true and since this will not evaluate to True these two lines will not be executed I hope I made this clear for you and this was a clear-cut explanation of underscore uncore name equal toal underscore uncore Main in Python I hope you got the point so D the name evaluates to the name of the module in Python from where the program is ran if the module is being run directly from the command line the name is set to string uncore uncore maincore uncore does this behavior is used to check whether the module is run directly or imported to another file so whether the module is being run directly or being imported from another file can be determined using this thing so we put this to ensure that we are running this file and not importing this file so if you are running this file this will be executed if you are importing this file this will not be executed but you will get all these functions and classes from this file let's talk about global keyword the global keyword is used to modify the variable outside of the current scope what does it mean it simply means that you can use this keyword to modify variable outside of the current scope so let me give you an example and we are going to write 04 uncore global. py so let us say I have a is equal to 9 and let us say I have this function and I have a is equal to 8 what will happen if I print a here what will happen and what will happen if I print a here and call this function so let me show you the value of a here is 9 but the value of a here is 8 what if I say a is equal to 900 and then print a I'll show this to you as well so firstly the value 9 is printed which is the global value of a then what happens is this a is printed and this 900 is printed because now the value of a is 900 now if I print a will 900 be printed or will 9 be printed definitely will be printed because we are talking about this value now what if I want to modify this value and not the value we are talking about inside the function now if I say Global a I'm basically saying that I want to modify This Global value so if I run this program now you can see initially nine was printed now when I call this function 8 will be printed because now the value of a is 8 then 900 will be printed but this print a will also print 900 because I am actually modifying the global value of a from this function so this is a use of global keyword I hope you understood the global keyword clearly so in a nutshell what we are doing is we are creating Global variables from local scope so from inside the function we can create Global variables I hope you got the point and I hope you understood how Global keyword works we'll not talk about enumerate function in Python and we are going to use this enumerate function a lot um if if you are working on some Jango application or if you are into data science you'll definitely use enumerate function a lot so the enumerate function adds counter to an it trible and iterates iterates it let me explain you what enumerate is by creating a program because this text doesn't explain enumerate clearly right if I have a list and let us say I have one five uh say six and let us say I have apple inside this list now let us say I want to iterate this list and print all the items of this list I'll say for item in a print item and yes this will work definitely this will work 146 Apple now let us say I want to say something like this I want to say f first item number I is this item number two is this item number three is this if I want to do something like this I'll have to create a variable I I'll say I is equal to I + 1 and here I'll say I is equal to 0 and since I is equal to I + 1 here what I'll do is I'll run this program and you can see item number zero is one um if I put this increment statement above this statement we we'll see the coun is starting from one it number one is 1 2 is four 3 is six for is Apple but is isn't this a lot of pain to create a new variable and then increment it and then use it inside the F string can we not do better definitely we can do better um let me explain what we can do let me comment this out and I'll show you another way to do this I'll say for I comma item in enumerate a and we don't have to increment anything we don't have to do anything we just run it and you can see that we have item number zero is 1 one is four two is six three is Apple so in two lines of code we are doing something which was being achieved in four lines of code and yes you can you can make this i+ 1 2 to make this counter start from one not a big deal I know a lot of people will ask me this question how do I make this I start from one this is starting from zero this will start from one if you want to make it start from two you can simply say I + 2 and so on so this is the basic usage of enumerate function the enumerate function adds counter to an iterable and returns it so you can add a counter to an iterable and return uh and return that counter okay so for I item in list one print I comma item this will simply print this index along with the item so prints the item of list one with index as simple is that now another topic I want to talk about is list comprehensions list comprehensions is an elegant way to create list based on existing list what does it mean this doesn't explain it enough let me create a program list comp. py if you are a beginner you will not understand list comprehension just by reading this text so I'll make it easy for you let say we have a list 1 2 3 4 5 6 now let us say I tell you to create another list out of this list listen to me very carefully please I am telling you to create a list out of this list which will contain square of the items of this list how will you do it you can use a list comprehension you can so let me let me discuss the naive approach first and then we'll see how we can use list comprehension to make make that better so you'll say L2 is equal to an Mt list then you'll say for item in L1 then you can say l2. append and then item okay L2 do append item multiply by item because we want to have a list which contains the square of the items in L1 so if we print L2 you'll see that we have 149 16 25 36 which which contains the squares of these numbers very simple to do but can we do better and definitely yes we can do better let me show you how we can do the same thing in one line of code we'll say I star I for I in L1 that's it and you'll be amazed to see that this particular line of code can do the job better than these three lines of code because these three lines of code is a lot of pain and it adds lines of code to your program and is not as readable as this so what you are doing is you are saying I need I multiply by I for I in L1 so this is something that you can do you can also use if statement here you can say if I is greater than two if you do something like this then you'll only get items where I is greater than two so for this it will not be executed because one is not greater than two two is not greater than two it will start from three onward words and it will give you 99 16 25 and 36 so you can use if if statements like this along with this list comprehension in a very similar manner we have dictionary comprehensions we have set comprehensions and I want you to explore all those things I have given an example of uh this if statement here as well so you can run this example as well and indeed it is an elegant way to create list so this was about Advanced python 1 this doesn't contain anything which is difficult to understand a lot of people confuse Advanced with difficult to understand I think it's not that way you should not look at Advanced as difficult to understand but rather these are the topics which doesn't come into a broader topic which is why I have separated these topics into another chapter Al together which is Advanced python 1 let's now move on to chapter 12 practice set and see how we can practice these Advanced python 1 topics let's move on to chapter 12 practice set now let's now move into chapter 12 practice set and see what questions we have to solve here so this particular problem says write a program to open three files 1.txt 2.txt and 3.txt these are three separate files what we have to do is we have to print a message without exiting the program that this file is not present so basically what it means is that you need to use try accept you need to try this code and if this code fails you just have to print the message so let me show you how we can solve this particular thing we'll say 07 uncore p1. py and since we are writing this thing we have to say try and I'll say with open let us say 1.txt and yes we want to read it so read mode and as FF read okay we just have to read it we don't have to print the content or do something else in a very similar way I'll do 2.txt and in a very very similar way I'll do 3.txt and as you can see that if none of these files are existing or if one of these files are not existing there will be an error and accept exception as e let me fix the syntax as simply say the file is not present program or rather I should say reason and I'll say e now I'll use this F string because I'm using this e variable and let me run this none of these files are present so right when it tries to open 1.txt there will be an error and the error is printed here the error is not thrown because we are using using pry catch we are simply printing this particular thing so the program is not exited so whatever I write here will also be printed thanks for using this program if I do something like this thanks for using this program will also be printed as you can see because the program is not exited it doesn't exits here it simply stops here and it throws the exception but the exception has been handled by us and we are printing the file is not present and we are printing the reason so the exception has been handled by us and uh there's there's nothing that we are doing wrong here we are simply handling the exception so this is how try catch is working uh the synx is try and then accept exception as e let's move on to the next question it says write a program to print third fifth and seventh element from a list using enumerate function so we have this enumerate function and we want to print third fifth and seventh element from a list let's do it so I'll create a program called 08 pr02 py and what I will do is I'll simply say list 1 is equal to 1 2 uh and I want to keep my list straight and simple why am I doing that because I want to check whether I'm printing the third fifth and seventh element or not so I'll say for item in enumerate list one and I'll also write index so this is a Syntax for using enumerate now what I will do is I will say if index + 1 is equal to equal to 1 or index + 1 is equal to equal to 3 or index + 1 is equal to equal to 7 you must be wasn't wondering what's this index + one why not index why index + one so the first element is index zero second element is index one here the program or rather the question says that we have to print third fifth and seventh element so if index + one is third fifth or 7th so let me write three 5 and 7 I'll say print item else we are not doing anything else else we are not doing anything okay so I'll simply run this program and you can see third fifth and seventh element printed from a list so when index + one is three it's the third element when index + one is five it's The Fifth Element when index + one is 1 it's the first element so index for the first element is zero I hope you got the point I hope that you understand that index in Python starts from zero but if I talk about the first item then it will be at index zero so which is why I've written this index plus one if you think about it you'll definitely understand why I have written index + one now the next question says that right list comprehension to print a list which contains the multiplication table of a user entered number so user enters a number and we have to print the multiplication table once again a really simple and straightforward problem let me solve this for you so I'll say num is equal to end input I'll say enter uh number and then what I'll do is I I'll say multiplication is equal to I'll say I multiply by number for I in range 1 to 11 what is this 1 to 11 you must be thinking let me print the multiplication for you and then I'll explain you what what these three lines of code mean or other what the single line of code means because you understand what this line is doing and you definitely understand what print statement is doing let me know run this code for you and let me show you that this multiplication table actually prints the multiplication table of five what I'm doing is I'm saying I need I multip by num for all the values of I ranging from 1 to 10 now you need to understand that the range function goes from 1 all the way to 11 - 1 which is 10 so the first element of the range is included but the last one is not included it goes from 1 to n minus one in this case n is 11 so it goes from from 1 to 10 and this is how range function is working and I hope you understand how this range function is working okay so we are simply printing the multiplication table here and this is how this program works and we have solved this problem pretty simple pretty straightforward I hope that you understood this and I hope you got my point when I said the advanced python doesn't mean difficult python this is the easiest concepts of python that you are going to learn so I hope that you got the point and you understood all these questions very well fourth question says that write a program to display a by B where A and B are integers if B is equal to Z display in finite by handling the zero division error and this is something I want you guys to solve because while we were talking about these Concepts while we were talking about um try and catch I explained all this to you so since we have already talked about this stuff I want you guys to solve this problem on your own all you have to do is you have to specifically handle this zero division error and you have to print infinite by handling this error that's all so a by B where B is equal to 0 is infinite but when you try to do the same thing in Python it throws an error and this question says that do not throw an error but rather than throwing an error what you do is you give infinite as output to the user so this is something which is being told in this question and you can solve this question pretty simple now question number five says that store the multiplication tables generated in problem three in a file named table. txt and this is something I want to solve and I know this is easy as well but once again I just want to solve this problem PR 05. py and what I'll do is I'll copy this to this and what I'll do is I'll write this multiplication I'll say with open m. dxt as f and I want to open this in right mode I'll say f. write I'll say multiplication and if I try to run this program I'll say five and it says that uh you need to convert this to string first before you can write it to a file okay let me do this and I'll say five and yes m. txt will contain this you can even beautify this piece of code and write it to a file in in a very similar way uh we have already done during file IO so in file IO we already created a multiplication table and wrote all these tables to a file I hope you can do all those things here as well and for some of those people who don't want to solve this problem or who are facing issues in solving this problem uh just refer to the program I wrote here um I'll just pull that program out so here while you are handling the zero division error let me solve this problem for you as well I'll say pr04 py I'm solving this because we already have it solved right so a is this B is this I want to get rid of this uh print a by b i I'll not print a by B here I'll print a by B here and I'll get rid of this else I'll get rid of this there was no errors and when there is a zero division error I'll simply print infinite that's all we need to do okay so let's run this code 5 and it says 0 division error um I think there is some problem here okay so my bad I should have created a variable C and I should have done something like this and I'll print C so what I'll do is I'm printing infinite here or rather let me say C is equal to infinite if zero division error occurs and at the end I'll print C so the exception should not occur here it should occur inside try so inside try at line number five this exception will urrent will be handled so let me show this to you once again if I say 5 it prints infinite but let's check whether it prints correct division values or not so 15 by 10 is 1.5 yes it does let me divide 16 by 8 and yes it's two so this is working this is working quite well so we have solved all these questions I hope you understood how we solved these questions using the concepts we learned in chapter number 12 now we'll move on to chapter number 13 and learn more about some python Concepts let's move on to chapter number 13 now so now we are going to look at chapter number 13 so let's open this PDF so that we can look into the concepts that we have in advanced python 2 so the first concept is virtual environment and let's talk about this because this is really very important topic if you are working in applications like flask or Jango even if you are going forward and looking for working in data science of machine learning you'll definitely encounter virtual environment at least once in your lifetime so an environment which is same as the system interpreter but is isolated from the other python environments on the system let me explain so what I'll do is I'll open this particular folder in vs code and when I run a python file so let me uh create a file called vm. py if I run this python file uh if I say print hello word uh oops print hello word and if I do something like this let me show you my terminal see that python is being used to run this particular file if I say python you can see that this particular interpretor is running name I'll exit my python interpreter or RL which is a Apple uh now let us say I want an application which runs on python 3.6 but I have python 3.9 installed or let us say that I have this python 3.9.4 but we have an update for python let us say 3.12 now I want this application to work as expected but also I want to update my python interpreter let us have another scenario wherein we have two different python versions and two different apps which work on these two different versions how do we run these apps how do we lock the environment and when I say environment I mean the python installation on this computer I can either have 3.9.4 or 3.8 something when I'm typing python how do we solve this problem we solve this problem using virtual environment and listen to me very very carefully once you listen to me definitely all of your doubts will go so we'll install a package called virtual environment and before we type it install virtual environment virtual environment so virtual environment is a python package which you can use so what we can do is we can use this v n and we can create virtual environments I'll show you how now in order to use Virtual environment what you'll have to do is you'll have to say python minus M VN and name of your environment and the moment I fired this you can see that a new EnV folder has been created here this has a standalone version of python and I can use this particular python environment to run my Python scripts how do I activate this vir environment if you are on Linux I'm not on Linux by the way but I'm telling you for Linux you just have to say source and then you have to say EnV then then bin and then activate and just execute this but since I'm in Powell I'll say EnV and I'll say scripts and I'll say activate. PS1 so activate. PS1 is the script which activates the virtual environment as you can see that EnV is being shown here which tells me that this particular virtual environment has been activated so this EnV tells me that this environment is activated now and I can use this environment as and when I want okay now what I'll do is if I say python you can see python 3.9.4 if I say pip install pandas pandas will be installed inside this virtual environment no surprises whatsoever but once I come out of this environment pandas will no longer be installed I'll show you how and I'll show you this particular thing so let all these things install then what we'll do is we'll import pandas and we'll see that pandas works fine and then what we'll do is we'll come out of this virtual environment and after coming out of this virtual environment we'll see that pandas is not installed so what I'll do is I'll simply say uh deactivate and once I say deactivate I am I am out of this virtual environment remember that this virtual environment has pandas installed now I might have pandas installed in my python interpreter as well let me check it by writing import pandas and yes I think I do have pandas installed because I work with data science very often so if I run this code nothing happens and this works as expected uh now what I'll do is I'll activate my virtual environment after uninstalling Panda so I'll say pip uninstall pandas I'm not inside my virtual environment as you can see there's no EnV written here so I'm not using this particular python installation the moment I say pip uninstall pandas it's asking me whether I want to uninstall pandas or not not and now if I try to run this file you can see that I am getting module not found error and no pandas module has been found on my computer now what I'll do is I'll simply say EnV scripts activate. PS1 and I'll try to run this file I'll say python 01 vm. py and it runs as expected why does this happen because my EnV folder or rather my EnV virtual environment has pandas installed so I can isolate particular python environment and install a set of packages inside that particular environment so this is called a virtual environment I can create as many virtual environments as I want okay so what I'll do now is I'll come back to the notes and I'll show you a few other things so virtual environment means an environment when as environment I mean python installation or the python installation environment where we are in an environment which is same as the system interpreter but is isolated from the other python environments on the system so if I have python 2 and python 3.9 once I create uh a new virtual environment that is isolated from my system interpretor okay now how do we use it you can either use Virtual EnV package or VM is uh it has been newly introduced and you can directly use Python minus M uh I just told you the syntax you can use this particular syntax to create a virtual environment okay okay both of these syntax Works uh now you can create a new virtual environment by using virtual EnV this this is another way to create a virtual environment let me show this way as well so you can even say p install virtual EnV and virtual EnV will be installed and once virtual EnV is installed you can use Virtual EnV to create another environment virtual EnV env2 and env2 folder will be created here and another environment will be created so as you can see that another environment has been created now what we can do is we can activate or deactivate this virtual environment just like we did for our EnV so I can say env2 scripts activate. PS1 and it activates env2 now okay the next step after creating the virtual environment is to activate it you can activate any virtual environment and you can install any number of packages in a given virtual environment and then definitely you'll be able to use those packages only when you are inside that virtual environment okay um we can now use this virtual environment as a separate python installation just like a separate python installation you can use uh python virtual environments let's talk about pip freeze command now pip freeze returns all the packages installed in a given python environment along with the versions so let us say we have this EnV environment as you know that I have installed pandas in inside my EnV what I'll do is I'll activate my EnV so I'll change this env2 to EnV and you can see that EnV has been activated now what I'll do is I'll run pip freeze command and what pip freeze command does is it gives me the list of all the packages which have been installed inside this particular environment you can see that we have all these packages inside our um virtual environment V now coming back to this you can fire this command and this will create a requirements.txt file let me show you how so if I say requirements.txt you can see all this content has been written to this file okay so the all these packages have been written to this file and you can use this file to install all these packages in a separate virtual environment let us say I want to create an virtual environment three uh uh let me create that virtual environment first so I'll say env3 and then after creating this virtual environment let us say I want to install all these packages all the packages from requirements.txt I'll simply say pip install minus r requirements.txt so you need to put this minus r flag and some of the packages have been installed some of the packages are installed let us say if I put Chango and if I try to install you can see that Django was not installed so Django is being installed once again and it takes some time and finally it will get installed so all these packages will be installed if you fire this command pip install minus our requirements.txt now the above command creates a file name requirement of txt in the same directory containing the output of pip free so as we saw that requirements.txt file is created in the same folder and also you can use this file to create another virtual environment so you can distribute this file to other users and they can recreate the same environment using this particular command I just showed you this so instead of shipping EnV folders We don't ship EnV folders We ship requirements.txt file which is a few KBS of size you can see that it's 414 bytes it's not even in KBS it's in bytes but if we try to look into the size of EnV you can see that it's more than 10 MBS so you tell me which is easier to Shi this one or this one definitely this one okay coming back to the notes we have Lambda functions what are Lambda functions functions created using an expression using Lambda keyword so you can use this particular syntax to create Lambda functions so you can do something like this so in a single line you can create a function and they work just like a function okay so if you uh if you familiar with JavaScript you must have heard of Arrow functions Lambda function are not exactly the same thing as Arrow function but yeah you can map some similarity from JavaScript Arrow function to Lambda functions in Python let's create another file uh 02 lambda. py and we'll see how Lambda function works so if I create a function like square and if I do something like this n and if I say return n into N I can print square of say four and it should give me 16 no surprises it will give me 16 okay uh oops okay so uh we have the 16 I I'll deactivate my virtual environment and then I'll run it and it will give me 16 for sure I could have done the same thing by writing something like this square is equal to Lambda x x star X so I could have done something like this so you tell me which is easier to write is this easier to write or doing this is easier to write definitely this is easier to write and yes I'll put the Lambda keyword as well so Lambda X XX and if I run this this will also give me 16 so you can look at Lambda functions as one line of functions and they are really very useful when the logic of your function is very short and concise uh so if you want to write multiple lines of code you'll definitely use def keyword and you'll use this particular syntax to write your function but if your function is really very simple and straightforward you'll use this particular synx I hope that makes sense and I hope you are able to map the similarity between these def functions and Lambda functions so this is something that you can do you can even have multiple arguments so let us say x uh let me create something like this divide is equal to Lambda XY and I want to return X ided Y so you can do this and if you put divide 4 comma 2 you should get two as the answer so you can see that we get two as the answer and yes this Lambda syntax is amazing let's now talk about join method in strings so join and format are two methods in strings and we'll look at all these uh syntax how to use join and format now let me tell you something join and format and all the syntax that I'm going to tell you in this particular chapter you might not see this because there are better alternatives to these for example a better alternative to format is F string and you should use F string instead of format is my personal opinion but in the older code basis you'll find these methods and you should not struggle when you see such kind of methods in your code base so this is something that you need to learn so let's talk about join in format so I'll simply create 03 join. py and join is really very simple if I say friends is equal to Rohit and then sh and then pry and then Niha and then disha so let us say I have these friends and now what I'll do is I simply want to print their names in a specific format what what does it mean I'll simply say Dash dash. join and I'll say friends and let me store it inside a variable and let me print a so I'll simply print a and let me show you what it prints so it will simply join all the values in inside this list with this particular U delimiter or separator if I put exclamation mark you can see that this is being printed if I if I do something like this is a friend so and then off and and see this is going to be fun because all this will print this RIT is a friend of sh is a friend of PR is a friend of deha is a friend of DHA Okay so if you want to do something like this when use joint so what it will do is it will take this string and it will put this string between all these commas and Chin the values inside this list as a string so this is how join method works really very straightforward it creates a string from iterable objects it need not be list it can be another iterable anything you can iterate you can use join with that particular object so if you say and do join L this will say apple and mango and banana so so you can try this join method yourself on some other lists let's now move on to the format method what what what is this format method what does it do let's write some code and try to understand so I'll say format. py and let me write something like this I'll say uh a is equal to I'll say I am a good boy and of friend off and I'll do something like this and I'll say do format and I'll say Harry and just see what this what this is going to print if I if I try to run this you can see that I'm a good friend and a friend of Harry so whatever I'm writing here is coming here okay let us say I am a good boy on this and let me write earth and if I run this you'll see that I am a good boy on Earth and a friend of Harry now let us say you want to put this Harry here and you want to put this Earth here so you can put a zero here and a one here and the zeroth element from here will come here and the first element from here will come here let me run this code for you and you can see I'm a good boy on Harry and a friend of Earth so you can do something like this really very straightforward syntax it formats the values inside the the string into a desired output so you can get the desired output using this format method the syntax is template. format and what is this template template looks something like this so I have given a very simple example of format this will tell you what format is so if you say Harry is a good boy or boy is a good Harry so you can see output for one and output for two so here we have these curly braces and we have Harry and boy here so Harry will come here and boy will simply come here by default but if I put numbers here if I put zero here and one here Harry will come at zero and boy will come at one so output will be boy is a good Harry so this is how format function works now let's talk about map filter and reduce and for explaining map filter and reduce I'm going to map filter red. py MFR py I'm going to write this particular file so in order to understand map filter introduce we'll look at the syntax and we'll try to implement it in code so map applies a function to all the items in the input list so let us say I have this input list and I have a function and I want to apply this particular function to all the items of this list it can be a Lambda function or it can be a normal function I can do that so let me get this particular function from here and what I'll do is I'll get a list from somewhere I'm searching for a list I'm searching for a list I'm not getting a list so I'll write my own list I'll say l is equal to I'll simply say l is equal to 1 2 3 4 and 5 uh comma five and once I do this I can use map I can say C is equal to map this function which is square to this list and if I print C now you can see that this function this is a map object so I'll have to convert it to list so if I type cast it to list you can see that this will return me 14 9 16 and 25 because I have ran the square function on all these values so this is something that you can always do you can map the square function to all these values okay so I hope you understood the gist of this thing now now let's talk about the filter function so map map function was used to map a particular function to all the items of a given list now what I'll do is uh I'll talk about filter filter creates a list of items for which the function returns true so let us say I have a function uh let me let me show you filter here itself and what we'll do is we'll say demonstration for map then I'll write demonstration for filter and then we'll see demonstration for reduce as well but for the demonstration of filter what I'll do is I'll simply say a is equal to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 89 so these are few random values that I have put here now what I'll do is I'll write of I'll write a function I'll say greater is equal to Lambda X and I'll simply say x is greater than 4 it will return whether X is greater than four or not okay now what I'll do is I'll say filter now I'll put a function which is greater and I'll simply put a and I'm going to put D is equal to this thing and then print D I'll do print D and I'll run this code and yes I'll have to convert it to list so once again I'll simply say list of D I have to close this and you can see that 54 67 81 89 is being printed because anything which is greater than four greater will return true and for all the values for which greater returns true they will be filtered out of a and you will see only those values for which this particular function returns true I hope this makes sense I hope you understood how these things are working now uh this is how Filter Works this can be a Lambda function and uh I forgot to write the second argument for filter my bad it should be comma semi trible so you can make this um correction in this notes reduce applies a rolling computation to sequential pair of elements how do we do this what does it mean let's talk about reduce and only through an example you'll be able to get the demonstration for reduce into your head what I'll do is I'll I'll use this list and I'll I'll shorten this list so let us say I want to apply a function to these two values and then whatever comes out of the these two values I want to apply the same function with that value and this value let me show you so if the function computes sum of two numbers and the list is this so that function will be applied to these two values first and whatever the value comes out of applying that function to these two values will come here and then we'll apply the same function to these two and then same function to these two and this is how reduce is going to work so the first argument to reduce is the function and second is the list so what we'll do is we'll say reduce sum e so sum is a function by the way sum is a built-in function in Python it simply gives you the sum of the numbers so if I say d is equal to this and if I print D this will throw an error why because reduce is something that you'll have to import from fun tools so this thing is important so this is something that you need to understand and remember that reduce is a function from fun tools module and if you don't import reduce from Funk tools you'll get into trouble because reduce is a function from Funk tools module and if you don't use reduce from fun tools and try to use it without importing it from fun tools you'll get some error let's see what happens so it says in object is not iterable what I'll do next is I'll write my own implementation of sum so I'll say Lambda XY and I'll return x + y and that's it and now I'll run this program and you can see that 13 has been printed so 1 + 2 is 3 and 3 + 3 is 6 and 6 + 7 is nothing but 13 as you can see that this is printing 13 so this is how reduce works and I have demonstrated this in a very good visual uh in a notes so make sure you download these notes because I have put in a lot of hard work to write these notes I've written these handwritten python notes just for you so make sure you download these notes and also if you want to practice more and more you should download the practice sets as well and try to solve them once again after completing the course this will give you a very good grip on python so now we'll be practicing some of the questions from this particular chapter let's move on to chapter 13 practice set now now we'll start solving some of the practice set problems from chapter 13 practice set so the first problem says create two virtual environments install few packages in the first one how do you create a similar environment in the second one so the question is very simple and straightforward uh what I'll do is I'll simply open my terminal and what I'll do is I'll say python minus [Music] mvv and what I'll do is I'll simply type some name I'll say environment one and as soon as I press enter the process of creating this virtual environment will kick off so what I'll do is I'll simply say environment 1/ script SL activate. PS1 and the moment I do that you can see that environment 1 has been activated what I'll do now is I'll simply install few packages let me install flask let me install Jango let me install SK learn and let me ALS Al install something else let's install say um let's let's install CB2 which is open [Music] CV and let's see if this installation works so flask worked Chango worked okay so we are getting this error and the reason is that in order to install open CV you need to write open CV Python and the moment I do that this should install open CV python now what I'll do is I'll simply delete this requirements. TX file which was previously created by me and I'll create a new requirements.txt file so let me say pip freeze and I'll simply run this command I'll show you which command I'm talking about so I'm going to open this PDF I'm talking about this command pip freeze and then this greater than symbol and then requirements.txt what this will do is this will store the output of pip freeze to this requirements. dxt file so let me run this command I'm waiting for this to finish and once this finishes what I'll do is I'll simplyy this command P [Music] freeze requirements.txt and this will actually store the output uh to requirements.txt let me fire this since my installation has been completed now you can see that requirements.txt now has this particular thing now the question says that you need to create another invite and you should have the same packages that you had in the previous one in the second one so I'll simply deactivate the environment I'll simply say okay so I made a mistake here I should have activated uh environment one so what I'll do is I simply delete this file uh did you see the mistake that I made so here environment one was activated but here environment EnV was activated by default for some reason vs code is taking this EnV as a virtual environment so what I'll do is I'll copy this command and I'll paste this command here so that uh P [Music] freeze or rather let me copy this from here again and I think I have copied and now I can run this so requirements.txt now contains the packages from environment one previously I ran this command while I was in environment EnV if I do this all the packages from EnV will be copied to this requirements.txt file which I don't want so I'll simply say deactivate and now what I'll do is I'll simply create another environment which is env2 I'm simply looking for the command to create this virtual environment now I'm creating another virtual environment which is named env2 uh rather environment 2 sorry what I'll do is now I'll activate this environment in order to activate this environment too I'll simply run this command and now what I'll do is L pip install minus r requirements.txt we have seen this command before we have seen this command here and this simply takes the requirements.txt file reads all the packages from requirements.txt file and it install it in your current virtual environment so our current virtual environment is environment 2 as you can see so all these packages will be installed inside environment 2 and these environments are really huge they are around 10 MBS and even more depending on the packages you have installed inside these so you you might want to delete all these environments later after you have learned how these environments are created and even if you are pushing a files to get do not push environments to get because environments are really huge and they can be recreated using requirements.txt so you can simply give this requirements.txt file to the person who wants your source code and they can create this particular environment again using requirements. dxt file now the question number two say is write a program to input name marks and phone number of a student and format it using the format function like below so we need to create this template and we need to format the string like this okay so name of the student marks of the student and phone number of a student are placeholders here so what I'll do is I'll simply copy this the name of this student is Harry let me type it here the name of the student is Harry or rather I I'll give a placeholder here and his marks are then another placeholder here and phone number is another placeholder here now let me create a new file I'll simply say 06 unor p r2. py and I'll paste this string here and what I'll do is I'll say St is equal to this and I don't want to use co- pilot as of now I'll close this terminal now what I'll do is I'll simply say st. format and I'll give the values of all these placeholders so I'll say Harry and then I'll say 34 and then I'll say 98888 is the phone number do not call me okay this is not my phone number okay so now what I'll do is I'll simply say print a let me say a is equal to std. format and if I print a you'll see that this has been printed and I hope you got the point this is automatically taking the cnv environment and activating it the moment I create or open my terminal but yeah you can delete this virtual environment if you don't want to use Virtual environment now what I'll do is I'll move on to the next question the next question says that a list contains a multiplication table of seven WR a program to convert it to a vertical string of same numbers and yes this is very important okay okay so let me create a new file 07 p03 py so we have a list let's call it a and we have multiplication table of two say two here and I'll generate multiplication table of two like this I'll say I start two for I in range 1 comma 11 so this is multiplication table of two now what I'll do is I'll simply say for item in a I'll say st+ equals to item plus back sln what am I doing here you must be thinking and I'll explain it to you do not worry so I have a blank string here now what I can do is I can print this SC so this is the program to achieve the same thing so you can see that uh st+ equals to this type error okay so item is actually an integer so I need to convert to Str Str so a lot of learnings from this question so you cannot add a string to an integer you'll have to convert it to string and then only you can add a string to an integer which you want to consider as a string so you'll have to type cast using St Str and this will definitely work so this is the output that we wanted we wanted to create a vertical string and we have done that as you can see um so it was a multiplication table of seven so let me change this to seven because the question demands multiplication table of seven and yes vertically the table of seven has been printed I hope you got the point of the question and I hope you understood the concepts that we applied in this question the next question says that write a program to filter a list of numbers which are divisible by five so what I'll do is I'll create a program and what I'll do is I'll create a method is divisible and and I'll simply say that return if n% 7 equals to equals to0 return true else return false okay and I need to put n uh okay so the number was five and not seven so I'll have to say five now what I'll do is I'll I'll I'll create a list I'll say 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 and 10 okay so there are two numbers which are divisible by five I'll say print list filter the first argument is a function so I'll I'll give is divisible and the second argument is the list and this should print the filtered list so I need to put another bracket because I need to close this as well so I'll run this and you can see 5 comma 10 has been printed so all the numbers which are divisible by five are printed so what if I add 60 here will 60 be printed yes it will be in the list so you can see that 5 60 and 10 all these three elements are there in the list moving on to the next question and the next question says that write a program to find the maximum of the numbers in a list using reduse function now this is once again one of the easiest problems of this practice set I'll import reduce I'll say from fun TOS import reduce and after importing reduce what I'll do is I'll create a list let me add few numbers to this list now what I'll do is I'll create a Max function I'll say def Max I'll say 1 comma 2 three I'll say if not 1 comma 3 I need to put n m comma n I'll say if M greater than n return M lse return n so this is this is the implementation of My Method let me bring this down now what I'll do is I'll simply say Max num is equal to reduce and the first argument is a function and it's going to be Max what is the second argument of reduce the second argument of reduce is the list you want to perform sequential computation on I've already told this in this particular topic map filter and reduce so what I'll do is I'll pass in a and this should give me Max of all these numbers so if I print Max num I should be getting 675 and you can see 675 has been printed what if I make this make this the largest number of the list you'll see this printed on the screen as you can see that double11 has been printed as the maximum number from this list so I hope you got the point and I hope you understood how the Dynamics of these things work so this was about reduce function now the question number six is that one p freeze for the system interpreter take the contents and create a similar virtual environment let me do this for you as well I'll delete this requirements to txt I'll run pip freeze and let me deactivate and why am I deactivating because I'm already inside a virtual environment so this is something that you need to take care of you should not be inside a virtual environment I'll say p freeze requirements.txt and this will create a requirements.txt now I can create a virtual environment by saying python minus MV EnV and I'll simply name it system and if I call it system a virtual environment named system will be created here as you can see now what I'll do is I'll activate system system I'll say system scripts activate. PS1 and this activated my system now I'll say pip install minus r requirements.txt and this command will take all the packages mentioned in requirements.txt and it will start installing all these packages to my virtual environment system I hope that this question is clear to you and you can do the similar thing using some other virtual environment you you can take the contents or other the packages installed in a single virtual environment and install all those to other uh virtual environment so these things can be done very easily using pip freeze command now the next question says that explore the flas module and create a web server using flask and Python and this is really very easy all you need to do is you need to go to Google and you need to say flask minimal app and this will give you a quick start documentation of flask all you need to do is simply copy this and once you copy this all you need to do is you need to run these two commands and this will definitely run your server so let me show you how this is done so I'll simply close all these things and we'll create a new file 10or pr06 dopy so I'm going to do this and also what I'll do is I'll simply say app.run and this will start my development server but before installing uh sorry before starting my development server I should have flask installed so if flask is not installed then you will face some problems so you you need to install flask in your virtual environment or in your system interpreter for this to work so now if I control click this link I'll see Hello word what if I make this hello word to if I make this hello word two and if I save this what will happen is once I restart the server and reload you'll see Hello word to so flask is a framework which is used to create websites in Python and this can be used by looking at the documentation there are lot of concepts of flask so I will cover flask in some other video uh definitely in the future so if you need a flash tutorial just comment below and I'll create a flash tutorial very soon so this was about the chapter 13 practice set I hope you enjoyed chapter 13 practice set I hope you enjoyed the questions the concept of virtual environment and everything let's now look into a third project which is a web framework Jango yes we are going to build a website using this beautiful framework and we are going to understand a lot of things about this Python Programming framework so you can look into this project 3 and it simply says that you need to use Jango to create a website so what we'll do is we'll write Jango docs and let me show you something Jango has a beautiful documentation but more beautiful than that what I feel in my opinion is Chango tutorial and absolutely beautiful tutorial why do I say this because this is beautiful you'll read it and you'll find it out that this documentation or rather Chango tutorial is very very very well organized let's copy this particular thing I'm going to copy this command and I'm going to install Jango and I'm going to use a few best practices for example creation of virtual environments and uh you know separating the concerns let me fire a command python minus M VN EnV and I want to create this EnV environment and activated before I start doing some Jango specific stuff so EnV has been created and what I'll do is I'll simply say EnV scripts activate. pps1 and I'll install Jango inside this but it says no module Jango uh oops I need to I need to install Django first I copied the wrong command so let me simply say pip install Jango pip install Jango and this will install Jango Jango has been installed and now we can start using Jango and hopefully this command will also work and it prints the Jango version as 3.2.5 as you can see so now what we'll do is we'll look into the Django documentation and I'm going to explain everything you need to learn about about Jango so Jango has a concept of creation of project using a utility called Jango admin do not get confused with the code that it's going to generate you simply type jeno admin start project and let us say we are going to create a portfolio website just type the name of a project and it's going to create a folder with that name portfolio in my case and you'll see that it has a bunch of files in fact a lot of files and these files can be used by US to to use Jango framework so let's now look into another thing these people have explained all these files they are saying manage.py is a python utility it's a command line utility and then the inner my side directory is the actual python package let me do one thing what I'll do is I'll CD into this portfolio directory so that I'm inside this directory now and what I'll do is I'll simply do LS and you can see we have a folder called portfolio and a manage.py now I say python manage. pyun server which is a command to start the Chango development server I can use this so let me control click and once I control click you can see that this Jango stter page tells me that the install has worked and this is how I can actually start using Jango so this is not something I want to see because definitely if I'm creating a portfolio website I'll create some of the files of my own I'll write some HTML I'll write some CSS so those things definitely I'll have to write on my own but I'll look into the documentation and keep moving forward you can see that python manage.py run server has been written in the documentation as well and yes you will get this particular prompt you have already got this and it's telling me that run this command and it's asking me to do a lot of stuff but now the next thing that I'm going to do is I'm going to create an application so let me tell you the difference between project and apps so it's telling here what's the difference between an app and a project an app is a web application that does something for example let us say you have a project portfolio now you might also start a merchandise let us say I am a very famous programmer or something and what I want is I want to write a blog I want to write some website content for somebody else and I can call it sponsored guest post and also I want to run a shop on on the same on the same website and I can create three separate applications for this this simply separate Crees the concern of a Blog of a shop and of a portfolio uh sponsored project or something or whatever else I want to do let's say I also want to uh want people to contact me so if I want people to contact me what I can do is I can have a contact application and using that application I can make it easy for people to contact me they can email me or they can send me a text on my phone or they can directly call me on my phone so I can separate this concern to another application so while we are creating an application inside a project we are basically separating the concerns we are separating a Blog from a shop we are separating a contact utility from a shop or from a Blog so the first step that I'm going to create is home uh while we start a project it's highly likely that you'll have only a single application you want your Chango project to do a very basic stuff so in that case what we do is we just name our app as home so I'll simply run this command python manage.py start app home and what this will do is this will simply create a home folder here and this home folder will have this directory structure let's try to understand the directory structure let's try to understand the content of this portfolio home folder and the folders and files inside this home folder so looking at the portfolio this particular folder this is the name of our project portfolio was a name of our project and it will have these files these files have their own purposes but the most important file out of these files is settings.py and settings.py is a file which contains all the global settings for a Jango project so this is the file that we are going to edit a lot then another important file is urls.py this will actually tell my Jango project where to go for what URL and we are going to come back to this in a while let's go to the folder that was created while we created our home app and this has these files init.py tells that this particular folder is a python package another important file is urls.py that we are going to create inside this folder then we have views.py and we have models.py that will hold all the models of ajango application so we'll look into all these files one by one and when we start doing stuff in Jango you'll definitely understand what these files are for manage p is a command line utility db. sqlite is a default database if you don't know sqlite is a database and it's a file based database where all the content is stored in the form of sqlite3 files manage. B is a command line utility you can run manage.py and some command and it'll do something on your Jango project so coming back to ajango project let's start writing our first let us say page so what I'll do is inside portfolio you I'll create a folder called templates and inside the template I I'll create a file called index.html so let me call index.html and I'll close this tb. sqlite I opened it by mistake now what I'll do is I'll put an exclamation mark and I I'll simply say hello Jango now how do I serve this particular file when somebody comes to my homepage so what I'll do is I'll open two files first is the urls.py from my port portfolio which is the name of my project I'll open this urls.py and another file that I'm going to open is urls.py from my home project so I'll create a url.py from my home project it's not there so I'll create urls.py and what I'll do is I'll simply use the comments from this file to create urls.py for my homepage so urls.py for my settings page will tell my project where to go for what so what I'll do is I'll simply write path and I'll I'll include this include as well and I'll use this synex I'll simply say that whenever somebody is trying to access a URL starting from blog you go to blog. URLs that is url. by of my blog folder but in this case what I want to do is when whenever somebody wants to go to uh say any URL I want that person to be sent to home. URLs and what I'll do is inside urls.py of my home let me copy this urls.py here what I'll do is I'll map the URL to a view how do I do that I'll I'll simply map this URL with a function so what I'll do is I'll copy this I'll simply say path whenever somebody comes to this thing you just go to views. home and I'll have to import views so I'll simply import views so let let me import views by saying from home import views and this error will go away let me start my development server and let me see if things work so it says that there is no home function inside my views.py so I'll have to create one I'll simply create my home function using this syntax and what I'll do is I'll return HTTP response and I'll say hey so I'm not using my temp file as of now but we'll be using it very soon I've imported HTTP response let me go to this file and you can see this he has been printed so how does this work how is this he being printed here what happens is my urls.py will start searching for this URL pattern what is the URL pattern URL pattern is the homepage it will say is is this the homepage no it's SL admin is this the homepage yeah it might be homepage let's check home. so it will go to home. URLs that is urls.py of my home folder and it will check for a path that matches a blank because there's nothing after the slash here it's a blank URL so blank URL is being mapped to views. home that is a home function what if I want to create an about page as well I'll add a comma I'll give it a name about I'll give the function name about and I'll also say about like this and I miss spelled about so I'll fix that and what I'll do is I'll create another function and I'll say about I'll save this file and I'll open this file I'll go to slash about and it says that this particular URL is not found we have made some mistake and we are going to fix that so in order to solve this problem what I'll have to do is I'll have to remove the Slash from here which I've already done I wrote slash about but I've changed it to about and let's see if this fixes the problem and yes it does so this particular site is giving me hey and slab is also giving me hey so let's try to change this to about and let's see if we are able to serve this content so yes we have created a website this particular page is giving me this SL about is giving me this and if I want to create another endpoint which might be slash contact so what I'll do is I'll simply put my cursor here and I'll start typing contact and I should get another response called Contact once I write my contact function so I'll finish writing my contact function and once I go to SL contact this will give me contact so we have three pages in our website now the first one is the homepage the next one is the slout and the next one is the homepage okay homepage slab and/ contact now what I'll do is I'll try to map this to a website because this is not serving any HTML I want to serve an HTML using my endpoints so what I'll do is I'll use the render function I'll say return render the first argument is the request and the second one is the name of the template which is index. HTML let's try if this works and yes it's not going to work I'll tell you why so it tells me that template does not exist at slash so basically what happens is when you write return render request index.html it's trying to load the template using the template directory so this particular directory which is/ templates inside this portfolio this is not present in my templates D's variable where is this variable inside settings.py so if you remember I told you that inside settings.py we have all the global settings for a Jango project so if you go and try SE searching for template DS you'll find that this is the variable that we need to edit so if I add templates inside this di then this should fix the problem so if ioad the page you can see Hello Jango how did this happen how did this fix this error so what I've told D Jango is that I have a folder called templates inside the home folder so please try to use the templates inside this folder Whenever I Call render so whenever I use this render method what happens is this particular render method will try looking for this file inside the templates folder so this is a file that it will uh look for this index Ro HTML and where will it do this file for inside the templates folder I hope this story is clear to you and you understood how these things are working together in a very similar way I can create about. HT ML and I can get rid of this HTTP response HTTP response is mostly used when you have a very quick content to serve but in our case we don't have a very quick content to serve rather what we have is an entire HTML file so now what I'll do is I'll add about. HTML and contact. HTML inside my templates directory now ignore this error for now you have it and applied migrations your project may not work properly until you apply the migrations we'll talk about this very soon but let's ignore this for now and this is not going to hamper the progress you are going to make so I have this error even if you have this error this should not bother you okay so we'll come back to this now what I'll do is I'll try to use slash about endpoint and I'll get an error that template does not exist and yes this is right we don't have any template called about. HTML we don't don't have any template called contact. HTML this is true so what do we do how do we solve this problem we'll have to create about and contact HTML templates let's do that let's create an about. HTML file and also let's create a contact. HTML file inside about. HTML I'm going to write about and I'm going to say this is by about page the moment I do this and reload this page you can see the title is updated and the content is also updated to this is my about page I'll do the same thing for contact. HTML as well I'll set the title to contact and I'll set the content to contact us here if I reload this page or rather this page you can see that the title and the content have been updated now this doesn't look good we we don't want to design the entire website from scratch that is going to take an eternity we don't want that you want some quick and easy way to get to a website or rather a clean and responsive website design is there any sh cut to that and yes there is and it's called bootstrap and it's free it's fun we are going to use this so let's copy the starter template from bootstrap and start using it so what we'll do is we'll start with index HTML let me copy the starter template let me paste it and let me say hello Harry and we'll see that once ioad this page hello word is a title and did you see this design being changed yes this is due to bootstrap let's now go to components of bootstrap and let's try to pull the NV bar out of here what I'll do is I'll copy this code and bootstrap is basically copy paste let me put it in very simple and easy words for you it's simp simple copy paste just just copy the starter template and start copying the components and you'll get these components rendered as is let me show this to you so I'll get rid of this hello Harry and I'll paste this navbar component I'll save it and reload my index.html you can see the Navar has been printed so I can also call the title as Harry portfolio Okay or rather Harry's portfolio I do something like this and my title will be updated after the reload so once I reload you can see the title being updated now I can change this content to Harry's portfolio and I can even update the links for example if you look at these links I can say slash and then again for this link I can say about I can say slash about let me get rid of these Allis I don't want these Lis what I mean by allies is a list item it's an HTML tag which is giving us this drop down and disabled I don't need drop down at this point so all I need is home and about and I have put that out there so I can go to about and it will take me to about page I also want to add another Li which will take me to contact page so let me do that as well and all so what I want to do is I want to copy this template to about. HTML and contact. HTML and when I'm in contact. HTML I want to put this area page is area current is equal to page inside contact. HTML so that it is highlighted when we are in contact and also I'll cut this from here and I'll put it inside about and this particular about will be highlighted when we are inside uh about also what I'll do is I'll remove this active class from here and I'll give it to contact also I'll remove this active class from here and give it to about when we are in about what does this do let me reload and show you when I'm in about about is highlighted when I'm in contact contact is highlighted also I want to change the titles when these things are uh updated when when we go to a new page I want my title to get updated as well so I'll say about Harry's portfolio so once I reload you can see we are in contact we are in about we are in home so now what I can do is I can actually implement this search using Jango I can write some logic in Python I can do a lot of things using Jango but for the sake of this tutorial uh I know this is not a Jango tutorial this is a Python tutorial I just want to get you introduced to Jango so what I'll do is I'll simply copy few cards and few components from bootstrap and get you familiar with some of the important components of bootstrap so accordion is one of the components and I like accordion a lot I use it a lot you can copy this code and what you can do is you can put it inside index. HTML so what you can do is you can create a container so I'll say div. container and I'll put it inside this container uh I've saved it I'll reload this and you can see that this accordion has been copied to my website so so this is now a part of my website and I can use this accordion but I want some gap between my Navar and this particular container box so what I'll do is I'll simply put a class My3 and this will add some margin to my container let me show you how so you can see that we have some spacing between our accordian and Navar now is this website responsive oh yes it is let me show you this website is fully responsive you can use it in your phone and this will work as EXP expected so this is the beauty of bootstrap you get a clean design a responsive design all for free and I love bootstrap for that you can even change this nav bar you can change it to dark uh in case you have this question in your mind I'll tell you how to do that you can change this naar light to dark and this BG light to dark and once I reload the page you can see that we have the dark neb bar so in case you are a dark mode fan or dark color fan you can use this Navar and this will not change in contact and about this will change just in this particular page because we have changed it in index. HTML only in a very similar way we can design the contact page I'll revert back to or rather I'll keep it this way in case you want to use a dark nav bar or let me keep it light because I know that you can you can always change this to dark if you have watched the video uh so I I'll rever it back to light now what I'll do is I'll copy a few form syntax inside our contact. HTML and I'll simply create a container here now I'll go back to my forms I'm searching for forms in case you see that just let me know uh why am I not able to find forms so I think they have changed the the uh layout of the website so when the bootstrap was in version 4 forms used to be part of a component but now it's no longer a component they are keeping for form as a separate tab here which is fine we can always copy paste from here and I'll simply copy this form let me copy this form and you can customize this form as per your liking so let me see how the basic form looks like this is how my basic form looks like and I'm going to put a margin once again above and below my container so that we have some space I'll also add an H3 tag and I'll say contact us or me rather because this is a portfolio website I'll reload and you can see this contact me if you need some spacing you can always add a class of my2 My3 or something I'll add my2 this time so that I have some smaller space between my um this thing and this form I hope I have added class is equal to M3 if you want some more Gap you can always go for My3 or mb3 even this will give margin bottom three mt3 will give you margin top three so these are the things you can remember did you see that we just increase the spacing between this heading and this form you can change all these fields as well well you can copy paste you can do whatever you want what I will do is I'll simply copy this let me format the document so that it looks a bit beautiful now what I'll do is I'll copy this div and I'll paste it again and I'll change this to name I'll say name and I'll remove this T I'll say name and then I'll simply call this name again and I'll simply call this ID as name as well and you can see that name email address and you can create as many fields as you want you we have this check box as well we can even submit this form using Jango there is a lot you can do in a very similar way you can customize your about page just like I customized homepage and contact page I want you guys to customize the about page and show me once you customize it and also I want this particular link to go to the homepage so let's do that what I'll do is I will go to my uh Harry's portfolio I'll change the HF to slash once again I'll do the same for contact page where is my Harry's portfolio it's here I'll change this to slash and also I'll change this particular thing to slash so this is how you can use Harry's portfolio as a link now so if I click on Harry's portfolio this is a link this is a link this is a link again this is a link this is a link and you can navigate and our website works so this is an example of a very basic website that we have created using Jango I hope you like this website now we are going to talk about models and no we are not going to talk about any fitness models or music video models we are going to talk about Jango models so before I talk about Jango models I want to do some things I'll close my visual studio code and listen to me very very very carefully when I do this I'll close my visual studio code I'll delete this virtual environment you might think why am I doing that why am I deleting this virtual environment Al together after all we created it to use a Jango project right to use the uh separate environment for ajango application but I'm going to create it inside this portfolio folder so whenever you are creating ajango application what you should do is you should first create a project and then inside that project folder where your manage.py is staying you create your virtual environment so let me show you how this is going to look so I'll simply say python minus M vvn this is going to create an EnV yes it has been created now so let's do one thing uh we are going to Now activate this virtual environment we are going to click here and it is going to detect this virtual environment and if not you just restart your Visual Studio code and it should definitely activate your virtual environment by its own so it is not finding it so let me find it for my python.exe I'll simply select this interpreter and yes so now this particular interpreter is in use so now if I click on new terminal this is actually using my virtual environment let me delete this terminal and let me open this terminal once again and the moment I open this terminal you can see that this environment has been activated and if not you can always manually activate your virtual environment so now that we have this virtual environment activated I'm going to pip install Jango because we haven't installed Chango inside this environment we have created this environment from scratch and now what I'll do is I'll simply run python manage.py run server so python manage.py run server and this will start this server and our website now we are going to talk about models models are nothing but information to create a table in the database what does that mean let us assume that this particular contact me page is actually functional what will I want I will want this contact me responses to be seen by me to be exported by me or to be used by me so that I can know that who has contacted me for what and I should be able to get all these fields so before we create our model what I'll do is I'll come to this contact. HTML let me open this contact. HTML I'll close this one and what I'll do is I'll simply gather name email address and phone number so instead of saying this I'll say phone and inside ID as well I'll say phone type is equal to phone for is equal to phone uh and then what I'll do is I'll do the same thing for I'll remove this check me out uh and that's all what I'll do if I reload you can see name email address phone and definitely if someone is coming to a contact form they will want to write something so I'll simply say text text and I'll simply say description or rather how maybe help you okay we can do something like this let me reload and yes we have an input tag here I want to replace this with text area so I'll say text area and I'll close this text area and now this should look a bit better yes it is looking a bit better so I've made some quick changes to this form let me tell you all those changes I've added a name field so name for the name is name name for the email is email name for the phone is phone and name for the text is text this name is used to identify which field to pick from the form by the backend server we'll look into this very soon another change is the text area and now uh after I change this to method is equal to post and action is equal to/ contact we are actually making post request instead of get request so difference between the post request and get request is that whenever you are sending a get request everything will be visible in the URL we don't want that we want to send some more data as a post request to this URL to this endpoint now let me try to submit some data you can see that I'm trying to submit some data and once I submit it forbids me and we are going to talk about this what is happening here so before I do that let me tell you something that whenever we are submitting this form to SL contact what happens is this will go to this SL contact and we can handle the form here so let me WR handle the form here and what I can do is I can simply say if request. method is post what I want to do is I want to Simply say that when this request method is post just print the request. form okay that's all I want to do but since we have this csrf error we are going to solve this let's go to the Jango documentation and see if they have solved this problem somehow so if you read this documentation it is really very good let me tell you beforehand but again to quickly get hang of the things you should listen to me as well and after you listen to me and read this documentation things are going to get easy but let me see if they have talked about csrf so there's a syntax to add csrf token I'll show you where that syntax is so let me search for csrf here they don't have it here as well I remember on some page they have the csrf token and once you add the csrf token and this is the way to add csrf token what is csrf token by the way let me tell you let me explain what csrf token is but before that I'll simply add this csrf token and this issue will go away csrf token is a security measure which will protect your form from being submitted by Bots from some other Origins so this token actually takes care of the fact that the form is being submitted from the same origin csrf stands for cross-side request forgery and if somebody else is using the form and submitting directly from elsewhere they might do something malicious and we don't want that but for the sake of this tutorial we'll skip the details and let's reload the form first and try to fill the form once again and once I submit it simply says that visy request object has no attribute form so I cannot print request. form so in order to get rid of this error I'll have to say request. poost and I'll enter name attribute of the field that I want to see here so I'll simply print request. poost and name and once I do that let me show you I'll sub submit the form let me reload this form and continue and you'll see this name has been printed here what if I do the same for say uh I'll pull some field out of here I'll do the same for phone and we'll see what can be done let me reload this once again and you'll see that the phone is also being printed so we have all these fields here now we want to save it to some sort of database so we'll look into the models now come to models.py and before I come to models py and start writing the models I want to add my application to the installed apps so this application the name of the application is home is not installed yet so what I'll do is I'll come to go portfolio and I'll open my settings.py and what I'll do is I'll come to the installed apps and I'll add this app to my installed apps which app this particular app so the name of this application is home config so what I'll do is I'll copy this home config and I'll add it to my settings.py right here like this and this is now inside so I'll say home. apps. home config so this is the way to put it inside installed apps and the server is back up running again so this is something that you need to do for all the apps you are installing I'll close settings.py I'll start writing a class I'll I'll say contact and C should be Capital because we want to use Pascal case for the classes now what I'll do is I'll enter these three fields we have name we have phone we have email and then we have description so for for the name what I'll do is before I enter anything I just want to use models do model I want to extend this content class from models. model this is plain and simple Le inheritance and this is pretty straightforward what I'll do now is I'll say models. carefield and I'll simply put some default value I'll say default is is a blank and I'll do the same thing with models. scal field with uh phone I'll say default is equal to none or rather let me put it blank I'll do the same thing for email as well we have some something called an email field so we'll leverage that I'll use this email field and then we'll use a text field for for this description so I'll do this and just simply says that character Fields must Define a max length so I'll have to define a max length for this I'll say 123 characters for name and I'll say 11 characters or 12 characters 12 maximum characters for phone number so I can do this and once I reload this page or click on contact I'll come to this page and I can fill this form yet again I'll submit and once I submit you can see that this and this has been printed but we haven't used a model yet also we don't have any tables created in the database yet let me introduce you to the concept of Jango admin first so this is a schema that we have created this is something which simply defines a contact model model is nothing but some information to create a table in the database now what I'll do is I want you to follow along without asking any question and I want you to type python manage.py create super user you might ask super user for what who is this super user and what are we managing where is the account just don't ask these questions I'm going to explain everything in 5 minutes or so but we are getting this error which says no no such table Au user so to get rid of this error we'll have to run the migrations what are migrations when you say python manage.py make migrations this simply creates migrations for the models so what it basically does is it creates a python file which will be used to create the tables in the database so make migrations will create something called migrations in Jango and migrations are nothing but these python files which contains the information to create a table in the database and the moment I say Von manage.py migrate what it does is it directly creates the tables in the database all these migrations will be run and now I can use my um Jango admin to create a super user so the moment now I say python manage.py create super user to ask me for a username I'll use Harry I'll keep the email address is blank I'll choose password as Harry I'll I'll choose password as Harry again and I'll confirm that I want to bypass password validation now what I'll do is I'll simply start my server by saying python manage.py run server what it will do is start my server now I can go to slash admin and I can log to my admin account the username is Harry and the password is Harry so I'll be able to see all my models here but there is no model contact that we created why is that so I was expecting a model contact here but it's not present why is it not present because we have not registered this model so you will have to come to your admin.py and what you'll have to do is register your model I'll say from home. Models import contact now what I'll do is I'll say admin. site. register contact and what it does is it registers my model now if I reload the page you'll see this contact has been shown here now I can add entries to my contact table so behind the hood everything is contained inside my db. sqlite3 file which is this and all the tables are created inside this file as in when you create the data as you keep creating the data you will see the size of this file growing but Jango very very beautifully manages everything and this this is something that I love about Jango so you can close this admin.py and and you can now come to views.py and what we want to do is we want to import this model right here so what we'll do is we'll say from home. models and we'll import contact and we'll simply say C is equal to contact and we'll we'll use all these things we'll say name is equal to name and then we'll say phone is equal to phone and also DEC is equal to DEC and we have another field here email email is equal to email so this particular object is being created and this is the Constructor which we are calling we are saying the name field is name what is name we'll create this variable we'll say name is equal to this and we'll do the same for email and for the phone and we'll do the same thing for DEC as well so we'll save it and we'll simply say C Dove to save the data into a model so did you see this we have created a name variable which is nothing but the string that is typed by the user here this is also a string which is a entered by the user in the phone field here and DC is the field uh is a string which is entered by the user here okay now what I want to do is I want to submit this form such that it is saved in my database so let me open my Jango admin where is my Jango admin it's here so what I'll do is I'll submit the form here and you'll see the contacts being added here currently if I reload the page there are zero contacts let me try adding a contact and I'll make sure that it doesn't contain any error I'll say hey how are you I'll submit and we have a problem it says multivalue D key error and the problem is that here I'm calling it text but I should call it DEC because I'm using DEC here okay so I'll try again I'll simply say continue it will throw error again so let me fill this form yet again again I'll say hey how are you and this time it should go through and yes it went through let me reload this and yes I have this contact object present here and it has all the fields that I filled inside the form what will happen if I fill this form once again if I say Rohan and I say Rohan gmail.com I simply punch in some random number hey how is everything going if I do something like this and if I submit and if I come back to contacts you'll see another contact object now when you look at this particular list of contact objects you'll see contact object 1 2 3 but can we not change it to something meaningful and yes we can do that we can add a Str Str field to a model I'll show you how come to models and simply Define a dund string method and what you'll have to do is just return something from here so what I I'll do is I'll simply return name uh or rather self. name I'll say self. name so this name will be shown here I'll reload this and show you how so Rohan Harry now I have some idea who has sent this form to me you can also change it to email or write a custom string or something for example if I put an F string like this I'll show you how and didn't close this here and if I give a space and say self. email here here you'll see something like this so whatever you enter here will be displayed here and it will make it easy for you to look into these modeled responses so all these are responses as you keep on adding things here you'll see the model responses here so this is how it works this is how Jango model works and we have a website which is static but also accepts Dynamic form responses you can submit this form and your users will be able to submit information to your form which is created and managed by Jango I hope you like this particular thing about D Jango and uh I personally use Jango a lot when I need some admin panel so this admin panel is not created by me this admin panel is built into Jango and this is the beauty of Jango a lot of people ask me how do I change this particular text and this particular text in this Jango admin panel so simply Google how to change Chango admin text and we'll come to something uh which will tell us hopefully how to do this and yes I can see this let me copy this to my urls.py as this website says and this definitely works I've tried it and I'm telling you this will work so what we'll do is at the end of .p I'll say programming with Harry admin and I'll say pwh admin panel pwh portal let me save this and if I reload you'll see programming with Harry admin welcome to PW portal and I'll show you something else if I log out and if I log in again you'll see programming with Harry admin this is coming from here so you can update all these three variables and you can definitely change the look and feel of this now there are a lot of other ways to change the look and feel of Jango admin but we are not going to go into those features of Jango in this tutorial I hope you understood everything that I told you now we'll talk about static file serving what does it mean static file serving simply means that we are serving some files which are static in nature for example some text files CSS file JavaScript files where do we keep all these files we keep all these files inside a folder and we can serve static files from that folder so let me create a folder called Static and I'll simply create a file called 1.txt inside the static folder so here's my static folder I'll click on it and I'll simply say 1.txt and I'll add two variables to my settings.py one is static URL which is already added another is static files Dr so I I'll say static files dirs if I have spelled it right let me check if I spelled it right I'll look into the Jango documentation to see whether I have spelled it right so static files DS and I'll simply copy this and I'll paste it here so static files DS and what I'll do is I'll simply say uh stat I'll simply add static here so static is a folder and in lower case now what I'll do is I'll use my server and I'll say static SL 1.txt and you can see that 1.txt file is being served let me add something this is a file I have saved this file let me reload this is a file and yes we are able to serve this static file using Jango okay so this was about static files DS you can add multiple directories as well which is why it is a list you can add more than one directory but in most of the cases we use just a single directory to add static file folders to that so what we'll do now is we'll look into template inheritance so let's look into template inheritance in Jango and what we'll do is we'll simply use a concept which can actually help us in repeating ourself or rather I should say that it will avoid us or help us avoid repeating certain things in a website let me explain you what I mean by that so did you see this nvar this nvar is being repeated here here here now let us say I want to make change to this particular part of the NV bar I'll have to make the change in three different pages ideally I want to change a single component but I'll have to do that change in three different pages how do I avoid that to avoid that we use template inheritance and let me explain what it means so what I'll do is I'll create a base. HTML inside my templates folder and what I'll do is I'll simply copy this I'll paste it here so anything that is coming inside the container let me remove this I'll cut it or rather I'll get rid of it the base. HTML will now contain the nav bar and not the body or rather the body of the container the container div it will just contain the NV bar so let me save this file and let me come back to index.html in index.html what I'll do is I'll get rid of this Navar and the boiler plate and once again I'll get rid of this Navar and the boiler plate what I'll do is I'll Simply Save this file and I'll extend this file from the base template so I'll recommend you one extension for Jango I'll simply write Jango here and it's a very beautiful uh extension you can simply use this extension to get the syntax so you can see that I'm getting base. HTML so I'm extending base. HTML now what I'll do is I'll say block body and inside the block what I'll do is I'll put all this content and even in my base. HTML what I'll do is I'll create a block I'll say block body will come here and I'll close the block uh or rather uh to close the block I'll have to say end block body so I've ended this block I've started this block and ended this block so this is how we use block body and and block body will it work will my index.html work let's check and yes it works now what I'll do is instead of writing this navbar again and again I'll extend my template from base. HTML so at the top of every file I'll write this so let me come back to about. HTML so I'll get rid of everything I'll say whatever I want to enter will come here so I'll simply say and blog body okay so this is something that we'll do and after about. HTML what I'll do is I'll do the same thing for contact. HTML as well so so I'll simply paste it here so blog body and block and let's see if the website works so home about contact home about about contact as you can see that we have the same website once again so home about contact and let us say I want to make this contact as contact two I'll have to make the change only here and not to three different pages the moment I make a change here I change this contact to contact to or rather contact me it will be reflected all over the website so this is the usage of template inheritance and template inheritance really helps in doing this thing so I hope you'll use template inheritance in your Jango applications from now onwards also I want to talk about serving static files now let us say I want to create a link here and I want to serve 1.txt so in order to go to 1.txt instead of putting the entire URL for 1.txt what I can do is I can actually load the static file so I'll show that to you so I'll simply Google load static in Jango and I'll get something from the Jango documentation so you can see that I can simply say load static somewhere in my website I'll say it here or rather just above the body you can call load static somewhere and after you call load static you can actually write this syntax and once you write the syntax you can serve your static files so I want to serve my static files here so instead of saying example. jpg I want to serve 1.txt so I'll say one .txt and I'll simply say go to one so once ioad this page what will happen is I'll click on go to one and this is not serving the file so there is some problem I'll have to look into the problem okay so the problem is I've not used percentage I'll have to use percentage sign here and here as well and now it should definitely work so let's see if it works so I'll reload the page and I'll go to one and you can see that I I'm am able to go to 1.txt why is this important why why do we not write the entire URL and use this synex we we are not writing the entire URL because we don't want to change the url in the fature and break this link so let us say I was to change this static into static 2 if I change this to static 2 I'll have to make a change here as well but if I use this syntax it will automatically take the entire URL from my settings.py which is really very beneficial so I hope that this tutorial of Jango gives you a good enough introduction on using Jango if you want to see more of Jango I have another course on D Jango which you should definitely check out I will give you link to my Jango course you can go to my playlist and we have a Jango course here where I have covered everything in great detail I hope you'll love this Jango tutorial now what we'll do is we'll look into the deployment of Jango website I'll quickly tell you how how to deploy a website and then we'll conclude this video now I'm going to talk about how to deploy this Jango website and in order to do that what we are going to do is we'll come to an article that I have written for you and I'm going to find that article uh how to host Jango application using G Unicon and enginex so this is this is a Blog that I've written for you and I'll link this blog in the description and this blog contains all the information that you need to know to deploy your Jango website but in order to deploy a Jango website we need a VPS now what is a VPS VPS stands for virtual private server and in digital lotion it's called a droplet so it's basically a server that you can build what I'll do is I'll build a $5 server so all you need to do is sign up for dat lotion and you will need need a $5 basic droplet and then what you can do is you can choose a data center region and then it asks for an SSH key or you can also use a password if you want to use a password you can create a root password and then you'll be able to log in to your droplet using password but if you want to create it using SSH key you can definitely deploy your SSH key here but if you don't know what SS key is use a password now I want to create one droplet and I'm going to call it PW Jango tutorial or rather let me call it Python tutorial so I'll call python Das pw- tutorial and I'll create a droplet now after creating this droplet what I'll do is I'll log into this droplet and in order to log into this droplet I'll use SSH and these things might sound strange to you at this point but follow along and as and when you keep deploying your websites you'll definitely learn a lot more about all this stuff so I'm waiting for this droplet to be built and once this droplet is built we'll log into the droplet and we'll deploy a Jango application but in the meantime what I'm going to tell you is what a VPS is so VPS is basically a server which is there on the cloud so digital ocean has maintained a plethora of servers for us and they basically manage this server using some sort of computer program or something but but at the end of the day after sshing into this IP address I can go into this computer or rather access the terminal of this computer which has a certain amount of RAM and certain amount of display so this is a virtual computer so the best thing about this computer is that it is open 24/7 so I'll simply say SSH root at the rate of Ip and I'll be able to login after I type yes and I'm able to log in without a password because I used SS Mage key from this machine if you are prompted for a password you should definitely enter your password and you should be good to go now what I'll do is I'll use this blog and I'll step by step install everything that is required so I'll update the package index using this sudo AP update this actually updates the package index so whichever package we are installing inside the server will be latest the next thing we want to do is we want to install python inside the server and engine X inside the server so I'll run this command this will install Python and enginex and it's asking for a prompt so I just entered Y in fact I typed Y and press enter I'm waiting for engine X and python to get installed and in the meantime I'll grab the next command which is creating a virtual environment so you can either install virtual EnV or simply say Python 3 minus M VV and the name of the virtual environment so let me follow this way I'll copy this I'm waiting for this part Python 3 to get installed on this VPS I'm waiting for it I don't want you to think of this VPS as a computer which is there in front of me I am actually using terminal of a cloud computer which is a VPS so VPS stands for virtual private server I hope you understood what a VPS is so we are basically using this server and now I've created in fact not created I've installed a package called virtual EnV which I can always used to create a virtual environment so what I'll do now is I'm creating a directory project Dr and I'm inside this project Dr because I have entered CD project Dr now I'll create a virtual environment called EnV and it has created a virtual environment now what I'll do is I'll activate this virtual environment and then install everything that is needed for this Jango application so let me run this command to activate this virtual environment and this is how you activate a virtual environment in Linux in Windows we use activate. PS1 but in Linux we use the source and followed by EnV /bin activate and after doing this what we'll do is we'll say p install Jango G Unicon so we are basically installing Jango and G unicor inside this virtual environment so let me press enter and pip install Jango G Unicon now what I'll do is I'll simply copy this so what I'm going to do is I'm going to start a project called text utils but let me not do that let me copy my this code to this VPS and how can I do that I'll tell you how to do that so just search for an application called filezilla on the internet so I have actually opened this filezilla app if you don't know what this filezilla is you simply go to the internet and install filezilla I've written blogs on this topic as well but just install files Zilla client and once you install files Zilla client you'll be able to open this enter the host enter the username and leave password as blank so what I'll do is I'll simply use my IP address which is this and I'll put it here then I'll put 22 as the port and I'll press quick connect if you're using a password simply enter your password here now what I'll do is I'll go to this project Dr folder and I'll copy everything from my Jango application accept the virtual environment to this file Zilla so I'm waiting for all the files to get uploaded and once all these files are uploaded what I'll do is I'll simply run other commands so I'm waiting for all these files to get uploaded these are uploaded now now what I'll do is I'll simply run make migrations and migrate so let me me run make migrations so it says permission denied uh project Dr manage.py migrate I am root how can it say permission denied so it says permission denied so what I'll do is I'll simply say Python manage.py and it says no changes detected now once again I'll add python here as well and it says no migrations to apply which means that we don't have any migration to apply because I already pushed db. sqlite so all the migrations are applied all the data is set now what I'll do is I'll run the next command which is opening the port 8,000 so I'm opening this port 8,000 because I want to use this port now I'll try to run this application and it says permission denied once again so I'll add Python and this IP address can now be used to access the Django application so what I'll do is I'll enter this IP address Cod 8,000 and once I press enter it says that you need to add this to allow host let me explain what this is so what you need to do is you need to go to settings so you can do CD and then portfolio and then you can do vim settings.py and go to this allowed host list and you need to add the domain in this case my domain is the IP address so let me press I yes I can insert I can now simply right click to paste the IP address I think I lost my IP address I need to copy this IP address I just copied my IP address and now I'll paste this IP address here and now simply I'll and close it like this now I'll simply say colon WQ and now what I'll do is I'll go back and I'll run the server once again so I'll say python manage.py run server and I've done that now if I reload you can see this particular file has been created so we have home we have about we have contact and we have the static file so as you can see that I have this website hosted and you can also host your website like this but this is not a correct way to host the website so this Jango app works for sure but what we want to do is we want to use engine X to serve this application so that we can use the security features of engine X also we don't want to use development server from Jango it's not safe for production in fact it says itself that this server is not suitable for production it says starting development server at this particular address so we need to find some other way to host or Jango application so if you follow the blog you can simply use this G Unicon command so simply copy this command and paste this command and replace text utils with portfolio because in this case the name of our website is portfolio and not text utils now simply deactivate your virtual environment now G Unicon is working so we'll simply deactivate the virtual environment let me copy this deactivate and let me deactivate my virtual environment all you need to do is just follow this blog and you are good to go now what I'll do is I'll open this and create a file now I'll copy this particular thing in fact I'll simply press copy and I'll paste it here and now I can press Escape colon WQ to save this file now what I'll do is I'll create another file I'll create a service for gunon and inside this what I'll do is I'll simply copy this and I'll paste it here I'll simply change this text you ALS to portfolio I simply need to change this user to root and this is not recommended I'm using root user just for the sake of this tutorial uh it is not recommended to use root and run your application in this case I've I've created a user and I'm using that you can also create a user and you can definitely use that user now it created a Sim link everything is set now I'll copy this particular command and I have created a file called text utils in fact I I should have created portfolio but this is the name of the con file so it doesn't matter but whatever I type in here should match the name of my project so what I'll do is I'll simply go to the server name and I'm going to Simply change the server name to the IP address so I'll copy the IP address and I'll put it here Here and Now what I'll do is I'll copy this command and I'll paste it and I'll not change this text U because the name of my file is text U but change it to portfolio it's good uh do not put it as is now once again I'll restart my engine X and my website should work without the port so I'll remove the port from here and this website should work but it says 5 not too bad gateway we need to find out what's the reason for this bad gateway the reason in fact is that uh inside this file I should have changed this user to root I should say something like this because we are using the root user which is definitely not recommended but we are just using for the sake of this tutorial otherwise I want you to create another user and after creating another user you should use that user to serve your website now once again I get five not to bad gateways is there any other reason I'm getting this so my server name is right the location is right I think I need to change the same thing for this file as well because there's no user called Harry I need to change this to root so I'll change this directory to root I think there is another Harry inside this file I need to change so I'll simply go to this file and I'll change this Harry as well okay so another thing that you need to do is allow engine X because you need to allow Port 80 on your machine so simply run this command sud ufw allow engine X full and Port 80 will be open so another issue is for my case the directory is not slome /root it's /root directly so I'll have to edit these files once again and strongly I suggest you to create a user before you do all these things so let me remove this home from here and I think we are good for this file and also I'll have to edit another file which is here so I'll edit this file as well and instead of Slash home/ root I'll go to slash root and here as well I know it's a lot of work when you're using root user do not use root user simply create a user on your server and if you don't know how to do that simply read my blogs and definitely you will you'll come to know how to do that so I think we'll have to restart everything so I'll restart inex I'll restart gunicorn as well let me run these commands once again and now I think we should be able to access our Jango website and yes we are able to access our Jango website I hope you understood how to access your Jango website using inex and gunicorn and this is one of the best ways to deploy a Jango website because this method is scalable it scales very well this is safe your development server is not safe and it is fun and easy so I'll give you link to this blog and definitely you go check out this blog and follow the steps it is a link to this blog you can simply go to this blog or simply search this title with code with har and you'll get it I hope you like this video I hope you understood everything that has been taught in this course I hope you understood python very well before you go do not forget to download the zip file of all these notes what I'll do is I'll zip all these files and I'll put it somewhere in Google Drive or something I'll give you the link in the description and definitely you can download these notes definitely download these notes do not skip this step because these notes are created by a lot of hard work from my hand and if you download these notes definitely I'll be very happy and I hope I was able to explain you python in a very fun and easy way so that's all for this video thank you so much guys for watching this video and I will see you next time [Music]"
pF3KXOnxqr4,in this video i'll show you how to extract reviews from amazon we will be using python programming language to get this job done videos beautiful soup we will be using request package from python we'll also be using random which is a built-in package in python programming language and we'll be using soaks which is a proxy service capable of providing over 8 million ip addresses which is great we'll be using all these ip addresses to hit amazon.com in order to extract reviews out of amazon if you're confused already don't be because i'm going to take you to my computer screen and show you how all of this is done let's get started so guys we are back so let me open this particular folder in vs code i've created a folder for this entire thing we are going to do the extraction of amazon reviews so let me open this folder in vs code right click shift right click by the way open with code and then i'm going to create a main dot py so let me first take you to soaks.com and show you what soaks.com is all about so soaks.com is a proxy service it's an amazing service i use it all the time and it can actually help you extract out reviews because it can give you anonymous proxies out of the box and they have eight 8.5 million active ip addresses which is amazing let me take you to my account if you haven't already created account on socks.com you'll have to first create an account and then you'll have to copy your account this is my account so what i'll basically do is i'll simply go to this proxy list and i'll choose login and password output format is going to be file and filter is going to be all geo and let me show you what it downloads for me so this is the file it downloads for me and i'm going to use this as a proxy how am i going to do that let me show you so the very first thing if you are starting out from scratch the very first thing you need to do is install python so this is the very basic step you will have to install python and vs don't tell me that you don't have python and vs code installed on your machine you will have to download it okay so install python go to this website download python install vs code go to this website install vs code it's very simple you can install vs code and file just like you install a game on your computer okay so i'm going to say import request and i'm going to say import ps4 or rather from vs4 import beautiful so for those who are beginners and just starting out to use python let me tell you that i'm using a python extension so you can simply go to vs code and you can write python here and you will get this extension okay this is the extension which i'm using now what i'll do is i'll simply import uh what else uh i don't know yeah pandas as pd okay i don't think we need any more packages uh even if we install any more packages uh i'll let you know okay so you can say pip install ps4 and pandas and these two packages will be installed for me both of these packages are already installed so i need not install them again and again okay so let me now import random as well and i'll tell you why we are importing random now since we are extracting amazon reviews i'll simply create a list i'll say review list is equal to a blank list okay so this is a blank list which i'm creating and i will be appending all the reviews inside of this list okay now let me write a function to get a random proxy and what what is random block c in fact what even is a proxy i'm going to tell you just give me a moment so i'll tell you how to use stokes proxy let me specifically mention how using soaks proxy why use soaks proxy first of all because you can get unlimited ip addresses you don't have to hit amazon using a single ip address you need multiple ip addresses if you want to extract all the reviews out of amazon and if you want to extract reviews even in bulk you'll have to keep changing your ip address and hit amazon so i hope that it is clear why we are going to use a proxy in this project now let me show you how to actually use a proxy so we are going to use a request package and i am going to create a proxy like this okay so this is simply uh a dictionary wherein we have http and https we'll be telling python request that hey for http use this proxy for https use this proxy okay now if i want to directly use proxy i can simply say something like this let me copy paste why am i even typing i don't even need to type so we can say something like http and we can copy paste this one and same for https so i can do the same thing with https as well okay but soaks has ports from 9000 to i guess 9000 um i don't even remember so uh just a moment let me check so it has ports from 9000 to 9050 or something i don't even know uh so port number you can change port number i guess up till nine three double zero nine two double line so from nine thousand to nine to double and you can keep changing your ports so what i'm going to do is i'm going to use an f string here and let me copy this one and what i'm going to do is i'm going to say that hey just add and i'm going to do the same thing here as well so let me use multi-cursor functionality of vs code and for you to see what am i typing i want to toggle the screencast mode so i'll use random dot random and we are going to generate a random integer from 0 to 299 okay so this is a random integer which i am going to generate now in order to test this proxy and see what kind of ip address we are having like what is the ip address that we are hitting the request with let me tell you how to do that so soaks gives a checker so there is a link which you can hit and they will tell you what is your ip address and country and city etc etc so i'll simply say resp is equal to requests request dot get and the url is i guess https http checker.com api slash ipinfo and not to forget you have to say proxies is equal to proxy okay now i'll simply print resp dot text okay resp dot text and let me run this and the moment i run this nothing happens because i have not called the function okay so you need to call the function okay and also let me put this review list here okay so if i run it again why is it not printing huh so this is status true reason is something data is something so city is karachi in this case and city is novo kubask i don't even know how to pronounce this so let me run it again and we'll see some other city and country and this is how proxy is going to help us okay so now coming back to extracting reviews we will need to extract reviews from here let me show you where from here okay so since i need to extract reviews from here i will have to first take a product page okay so in order to take a product page i can simply take user input but in this case i'm going to hard code that okay so let me hard code that i'll simply say uh a is equal to or let me even write it properly product url is equal to so this is going to be our product url okay and let me remove this uh this thing okay so if i click this url let me see if we are being taken to this page yes we are now in order to generate the review url uh this url from this let me remove slash ref from here as well so if i want to generate this url from this url all i need to do is replace dp with product reviews very very simple you can see i just need to replace dp with product reviews okay so let me do that i'll come here i'll say review url let me let me zoom in a bit because review rl is equal to and in order to generate the url from product url i'll simply say for url dot replace i want to replace a dp with with what let me check with product reviews okay so let me copy this let me paste this here okay so we have simply replace dp with product reviews okay now what we'll do is we'll also append the page number now you will ask what is page number why are we even interested in appending the page number i'll simply click on next page and you will see that the page number is coming in the url as a get parameter so we'll have to add this parameter in order to mention the page and in order to navigate to the next page so i'll simply say page number is equal to and this is going to be an f string for us and i'll simply say pg pg is the page number okay now i'll also say pg is equal to 1 because uh initially pg is going to be 1 okay now i also need total number of pages okay i'm going to deal with that later but let me tell you we need the total number of pages so that we can know how long to navigate okay now what i'm going to do is i'm going to simply run a for loop and i'm going to extract reviews for every page but in order to extract reviews for every page i'll have to extract reviews for a single page okay so let me write an extract reviews function and extract reviews function is going to take a review url url and it is going to take the page number okay why am i giving it a page number you'll know okay so i'll simply say pg you don't even have to give the page number but i'm just taking it there so that i can have a better idea of what i'm doing okay so i'll say def this thing and i'm going to create a function here okay so now we have the review url we have the page number now we need to extract the reviews out of this page okay now what i'm going to do is i'm going to simply say resp is equal to request dot get request url okay re review url sorry review url and also proxies is equal to get random proxy okay this is a function now inside of this function we were actually printing this okay but i don't want to do this i want to actually return this okay i want to return this proxy i'm not interested in checking the ip address okay i don't want this i simply am interested in getting a random proxy which i've already got okay the response is this i want response.txt and i want to create a soup out of it so inside of beautiful soup you need to mention the text textual form of the html which i'm going to get like this resp dot text text and i am going to mention that this is an html and i want to parse this html using html dot parser okay so this will pass this text as an html okay i hope this is clear for all of you also what i'm going to do now is i'm going to extract all the reviews not just one review all the reviews on the page so we got the page we got the page data we created soup out of the page data but i am not interested in creating just the soup i want the reviews as well so inside of one page in amazon you can count there are 10 reviews one two three four five okay so here we have just five reviews nobody's one two three four five okay if i go to the previous page one two three four five six seven eight nine ten so maximum ten reviews are there okay so let me do one thing let me do one thing i'll come back here and what i'm going to do is i'm going to say reviews is equal to soup dot find all and i'm going to say find all the elements which are div where data hook is review now how do i know this i'll show you how do i know this okay so where data hook is review if i take you to an amazon review and i click inspect you will simply see the data hook is review for a review okay so let me go further up further up further up further up okay so data hook is equal to review so for a review the data focus review so this is a very good target for me to target the review okay so if i mention data hook is equal to review i'm going to get 10 divs and all these 10 devs are going to be reviews okay now i want to extract text out of these reviews so in order to do that i'll simply say for item and reviews okay and for all the items i'm going to generate a review dictionary now inside of my revolutionary i'll have product title product title is something i'm interested in and i can get the product title by saying soup.title.txt.replace why am i replacing i'll show you if i go to view page source and i show you the title you can see that there is this text written just before the product name i need to remove this text let me zoom it for you so this is the review page sorry title of the page not review page let me reset it coming back i'll simply say replace this with nothing i want to replace this with nothing i don't want anything in place of this just remove this okay this is my title okay now what i'm going to do is i'm going to say a review title so this was a product title and let me mention it like this why am i even using the camel case i need not use the camel case so i replaced this with product title review title now what i'm going to do is i'm going to say item dot find i'm going to find all the a's where data hook is review title okay and the process of finding this particular thing is always going to be the same so here data hook is review title how do i know this because i have actually inspected this element wait let me show you which element this element okay and this is the review title let me show you where is review title database review title here okay so this is the review title now i'll place a comma here let me zoom out and show you what we are doing the third thing that i am interested in is reading okay i'll say reading r a t i n g this is the rating and i want to say item dot find find all i's with data hook is review star rating and this can be verified by going to the site okay if you go to this particular stars if you click inspect you'll see review start rating is the data hook for this and the element is i so you get extract like this this is how i have extracted okay now what i'm going to do is i'm going to extract the review body okay review body now review body is a span and the data hook is review body i guess but i'm going to double check i'm going to double check i'm going to double check the data hook for uh for review body yes it's a span and the data is review body so this is how i'm extracting the review body out of this okay now we have the review title we have rating we have review body you can even have the review date if you want okay so the data for review date is review dash date if i'm not wrong you can even have the date okay so you can say review date okay just to better analyze which review was uh written on which date okay so review date i need to oops review date yes so for everybody we have review body we started in review title and product title for this we just replaced the title of the soup note that we are not using item.title because this is the title of the page the very page which we have extracted from the review url okay the page that we got after visiting the review url okay now all i need to do is uh append this to review list i'll simply say list or depend review append this review to the review list okay so this should extract page number one for me let me see if it's even extracting page number one for me and at the end what i'm going to do is i'm going to say df is equal to pd dot data frame data frame and review list okay so i'm going to create a data frame out of review list and i'm going to say df dot 2xl output.xlsx index is equal to false okay let me run this program now so this should extract the reviews out of the first page and they should create a file called output.xlsx and i should be able to see all the uh all the output weight i've made some mistake here so here i'm getting the uh i'm getting the element but i'm not getting the text out of that element so what i need to do is i i should not say just item dot find and data hook is equal to this i should even do dot txt text because i want to extract the text out of it okay and it would be better if i even do strip because if there are any spaces after or before that particular text they will be stripped let's wait for it to finish and let's see if we are on the right track so output output.xlsx it just finished running let me open this and see and there is nothing what's wrong here let me check what's wrong here let me run it once again i don't know what's wrong did i select a text and run it no uh i'm not sure what's happening i simply said item dot find this then dot text dot strip let's see if there is any output oh yes we have 10 um reviews so review title is anyway star ratings out of 5 are this and if you just want the rating you can simply say dot split out and you can simply take three point zero four point zero five point zero out of this entire string okay so this is also possible but reviewed in india on this state this state did that okay so you can you can always strip the text out okay if you want to strip off this particular text you know what to do simply remove this text okay so we have 10 reviews but we are not interested in just 10 reviews we are interested in even more reviews okay so how do we do that let me show you okay so what i'm going to do is i'm simply going to uh find out the total pages so i'll simply write a function to to find total pages okay for a product okay sorry this is going to be review url so you need to give me the review url and after you give me the review url i will be finding the total number of pages inside that review url okay so let me run to resp is equal to request dot get review url and the proxies is going to be get random proxy okay and this is a function of course now what i'll do is i'll simply say soup is equal to beautiful soup and resp dot text html dot parser this is something that we've already discussed now reviews is equal to i'll simply say sub dot find div which div do i need to find where data hook is something i don't know what okay i'm going to find out so what am i interested in let me tell you i'm interested in this number 15 with reviews i'm interested in this number and i can get this number from data who is this okay i can get this number from here so i'll simply say data hook should be data should be this okay and the moment i do this i can actually extract the text out of this so i'll simply say return integer because at the end of the day i need to convert this to integer reviews dot and text dot strip so that i can strip off these pieces which are um which are there okay on the left and on the line of this text and once i strip the text out i'll simply say split and i will split with comma space the moment i split with comma space i get a list with two elements one is this and one is this i'm interested in the second element that is index one so i'll say one okay i'll save one and i hope i'm doing this right one and then i'll say dot split once again and what should i split with this time i'll split for the space and i'll take the first element so if i split this the selected text with a space i will get this 15 this is the number and what is going to be the number of pages the number of pages is going to be um this divided by 10 okay and plus 1 i'll also plus i'll also do plus 1 because this entire number plus 1 or rather i'll say 1 plus this integer okay 1 plus this integer because let us say the number of reviews are 15 we have 10 per pages uh 10 reviews per page the number of pages should be two okay so 15 divided by 10 15 so if i show you the wrapper let me show you python and if i say 15 divided by 10 this is going to give me one so i need to add another one because there will be two pages in that case okay let me exit this having said that what i'll do is i'll simply find out number of pages so i'll say pages is equal to or let me say and pages is equal to uh total pages review url okay this is the review url and the moment i get the total number of pages i will run a for loop and inside of the for loop what i'm going to do is i'm going to simply um i'm going to simply generate this review url okay i'm going to simply generate this review let me copy this review once again so i'll say for i in range and and pages i'll simply say page number is equal to i plus 1 okay so this is going to be i plus 1 page number is going to be i plus 1 because index starts from zero okay and what i'm going to do again is run this extract pages okay oops press the wrong key sorry about that so product url is this review url is this and we have [Music] i hope i'm going in the right direction so i ran the review url is equal to something extract reviews this and also i want to put it inside of try catch because in case my request fails for one url i don't want my entire data to be you know wasted except exception as e and i'll simply print e and let me make it capital e okay now let me delete this output of this xlsx file so i've deleted the output.xlsx file and i'm going to run this program let me see if i have made any mistake or this is going to run properly i don't know so it just ran for all the pages let me see if it extracted all the reviews so we just have 10 reviews why so let me find out values for different so i'll simply print so also running for these many pages and i'll put n pages here and i'll say control d and also running for page i okay let me remove this and let me let me say plus one okay let me run this so it's running for two pages running for page number one and it's running for page number two and done okay let's see if it's able to extract all the reviews or not so yeah it actually extracted all the reviews if you see the count uh the count of these rows is 15. so it extracted 15 reviews amazing great so this is how you extract reviews from amazon and i hope that you were able to you know find out how to extract reviews from amazon but let me improve this program even bit further we don't need this we don't need pg all we need is product url at one place let me now do one thing let me say product url is equal to input okay i'm going to select all this i'll say input enter product url okay let me run this program and what i'm going to do is simply enter product url for some other product okay let me find some other product on amazon let's do for this one okay so i'll simply copy this url and i'll paste it here let me close output at xlsx because if i don't close it i'm going to get an error and i'll press enter so there are uh okay so it says pg is not defined what's wrong okay so pg this should be i plus 1 i don't even know why i've given this pg here we don't need it we don't need it but again let me run the program again place the url and how many pages are there it is only one page for reviews let me check if this is true so there are only 20 ratings so that's fine okay let me open some popular product so that we have a lot of reviews for that product and we can text test okay let me open output.xlsx this is great okay so there are only three reviews with um with review body so it extracted all these okay round hole in the fabric got entirely different color to after two washes the t-shirt is shrunk okay let me let me remove this now what i'm going to do is i'm going to wait i'm going to run the program first and then punch in this url and this has quite a lot of ratings let me check how many 13 000 ratings so i'll scroll down and i'll save you see all reviews okay so we are running into this error because there is a comma in this number and we need to remove all the commas from all the numbers okay so i need to write another line here to remove this comma okay so this is getting interesting now uh let me remove the comma after i take this text okay so i'm going to say end of this no end of not this i'm going to say dot replace the comma with a blank okay now let me run it again and let me see if it's running two five eight six two five nine pages so there are two five nine pages in fact one plus two five nine pages okay so uh it says the total running for two five nine pages okay so we are running for page number eight page number nine so there are a lot of pages so this is going to be a huge file but what i'm going to do is in order to make you understand how all this works i'm going to leave it and i'm going to come back when it finishes so finally it has gotten completed and let me show you the output.xlsx there are a lot of reviews let me see how many of these there are 2171 reviews and it indeed missed some of the reviews so as part of uh homework what you can do is you can wrap this particular thing inside of a retry loop so the moment something fails you're going to retry it okay and you need to keep retrying it for at least say 10-20 times and once you have got the reviews out of that page then you should be good to go but again this is amazing we had around 2200 and something reviews i don't remember but we have got almost all of those okay this is a lot of data and amazon is not going to give you all this data and soaks is a very nice easy and sweet way to extract this data out of amazon try it out for other products make some changes make some tweaks try it out for other website soaks is amazing you can expect a lot of data from a lot of websites thank you so much guys for watching this video and i will see you next time [Music] you
ZzkeHroO56c,alright guys so welcome back and in this video what we'll do is we'll take this mountain coders block forward so far what we have done is we have created a scanner and using all these wheels so what I'll do now is I'll say Python Manny start py Python manage dot py run server and this will start my development server and as you can see that this is home and if I say slash about I think there's no about there is a block and there is let me see my URL store py so in order to find out the endpoints so what I do is I will go to my mounting codons you I'll store py which is my projects you all start beware and as you can see that all the URLs are being passed to blog dot you alls for further parsing ok so what I'll do is I'll go to blogs you all start py and if somebody enters blog in the URL they'll be seeing this video and if somebody enters slash blog post slash something they'll be seeing this one and then once again contact will render this view ok so what I'll do is instead of about L say contact and you can see that contact is here at this point what I'll do is I'll go to get bootstrap calm and I'll go to documentation and I'll simply copy the starter template now that we know about the templates we know how template works a lot ways further time into explaining you what template is and how to render it because we have already finished one project and at this point you must be knowing what template is so if you haven't already access this playlist I want you guys to access it as soon as possible because this is the place where I have explained you everything about templates how to use a template and we have created a very simple project now is the time that we further hone our skills and move towards another project which is this blog so what I'll do is I'll copy this starter template and I'll paste this inside my I think I've already imported render so no need to render import render once again okay so what I'll do here is I'll create a folder called templates and I'll create another folder called static so inside templates what I'll do is I'll say index dot HTML then I have a blog home dot HTML and then I have blog post or HTML and then contact dot HTML I think I created this blog post outside templates so you need to make sure that all the templates are inside a template folder ok so what I'll do is I'll click this templates once again and I'll say contact not HTML so I have these four HTML files inside my templates folder what I'll do at this point is I'll copy this into index dot HTML and we'll definitely be using the concept of template inheritance but at this point what I'll do is I'll simply test this website whether this works perfectly or not so I'll visit my home page this doesn't work because I haven't yet integrated my template with my views so what I'll do is I'll simply go to my views dot py and instead of saying HTTP response what I'll do is in fact I'll simply remove this instead of commenting out because you guys at this point know what HTTP responses and what render is so I'll set it turn a render and inside render the first argument is going to be request and the second argument is going to be the name of the template okay so the name of my template is index dot HTML let me save it and let me see if it works it doesn't work it's a set template does not exist and the reason for this error is that we haven't yet told Django where my templates are so in order to tell Django where my templates are what I'll do is I'll go to my I'll go to my project and I'll go to settings start py off my project and inside the setting start py what I'll do is I'll go to my templates and I'll tell Django that hey Django my templates folder is here and please look into this folder so I'll simply search for templates and inside di yards I'll simply set templates and once I do that in my server reloads you can see that it works why does it work it works because I have told Jango I have entered this templates inside my dir Celestin settings or py telling Jango that hey Jango my templates are inside my templates folder so please look into that folder sharing I will say ok I'll look into that folder and if the template is found you are lucky and you can see that return render request index dot HTML will return the template and you will see the template rendered here obviously I'll be using the concept of template inheritance in Jango but at this point I want to copy this index dot HTML everywhere and we can simply have the same template in about we can have the same template in our say contact or whatever page we are creating inside the blog but at this point what I'll do is I'll simply create a base template which will host my base template code I just want to close the settings of view and inside my templates what I'll do is I'll say base dot HTML and inside my paste or HTML what I'll do is I'll copy this code which was previously in the siding inside index dot HTML and this will contain my base code and what is that base quote going to be that base code is going to be a navbar it'll be a footer there will be some sort of say navigation menu inside my header I don't know I'll just simply place this tag here I think I haven't yet enabled my Django extension so let me do that I'll go to my extensions and I'll enable my Django extension so I'll simply write Django and this extension is now enabled globally now that this extension is enabled globally I will close this one and I'll simply save this based on HTML and now you can see that if I write block I'll have this recommendation I'll say blog title and since this is a very small block I want to have this block in a one-line in a single I in fact I will be having all the blocks on the speech in a single line because this is the base template okay so I'll simply save it and at the same time what I'll do is I'll I'll create another block called block body and I'll save it and I like all of my block cents a one line because it looks clean okay so I'll remove this h1 and instead of this h1 what I'll do is I'll put my navigation bar so I'll go to components I'll go to nav bar and I'll copy a nav bar from there so I'll copy a nav bar and I'll paste this number here ctrl s to save and our I'll do is I'll simply make this doc so instead of light I'll make it dark I like when I bar a stock I don't know if you like the same thing or not but I like my nav bars dark so I have simply changed my based or HTML but my index dot HTML has not been changed what I'll do at this point is as I say extends and I'll say base dot HTML and I'll say blog body should contain this is my index page ok so if I reload this page you can see this is my index pages here now what I can do is I can simply come to my base dot HTML and I can simply change all these things for example I can call this mount a encoders I can save this one I can come here home and then I can call this one blog this will display the blog home and once again I can remove this one because I don't want these anymore and I don't want this disabled one as well and I can have this contact ctrl s to save and hrf will be blog and contact respectively so I'll jablow and this one week on that let me make this one as slash blog and as you can see I have this blog I have this contact I have the home air controllers to save and let me see how it looks so Mountain coders home blog contact if I click on blog I can go to blog if I click contact I'll be taking new contact and I hope you understood how these things are structured now what I'll do is I'll go to base to HTML and I'll simply add some sort of footer or maybe I'll do that later and too lazy to add a footer I'll simply ctrl s to save and what I'll do at this point is I'll go to my contact and I'll copy this one so I'll copy the same thing and instead of saying this is my index page I will say this is my contact page and we're not going to keep this all the time this is simply to see whether this works or not so I just want to write this contact here so that I can simply click on my header I can click on contact and I can see my page going to contact dot HTML and once again when I click on blog I want myself to be taken to blog page and so on ok so what I'll do is I'll simply come to blog home dot HTML and I'll say this is my blog page so I have saved everything I will reload this home ok so it doesn't work because I haven't changed these things in my this thing blog view so it's a blog I don't want to install any format at this point so I'll cancel that one maybe later or let me install it after all it's insisting me so much so let me install it contact dot HTML and ctrl s to save and once I reload this one you can see that contact ok so it says blog dot HTML is not I think its blog home it's start block so it's flog home as you can see here there's no blog here this blog home so I think I need to have blah oh man okay and we'll come back to this blog post I will show you how to render your blog posts inside the template but at this point what I'll do is I'll simply reload this one home blog contact mountain coders okay so clicking on mountain qoodles doesn't take me to my home page I need to fix this one so what I'll do is I'll go to mine now bar where's my navbar where's my nav bar it said ok so what I'll do is I'll say it's a little slash so this one will take me to the home page when clicked so I'll reload this and you can see when I click on mountain coders I'm being taken to the home page home blog contact maybe we can have a search page as well so let us create that search page as well so I'll since search results dot HTML or search dot HTML just to keep it simple and what I'll do is copy this paste it here and I'll say here are your search results ok so what I'll do now is I'll go to my based on HTML and once I once I have this search dot HTML page I can simply connect my search button to search for HTML page what I mean by that is I can have this form to be posted to search toward HTML so what I'll do is I'll say action is equal to post and then sorry action is equal to slash search and Method is equal to post because I want this to to be a post request when I'm when I'm taking this input from here to my search endpoint I want it to be passed as a part of post request or you and simply have get requests as well because this is a very simple form and this is not a login form but if you have a login form or a signup form where the details of the users are important and they can get in those cases you might want to use post but in this case I'm using get so what I'm doing is I'm saying whenever somebody is taking to /search with a get request and with this text what I want is I simply want that user to be shown the search results whichever are matching with his query so at this point what I'll do is I'll simply call this search search dot HTML and we'll see how we structure this one but at this point what we want is we simply want this page to just exist so what I'll do is I'll load this if I enter something search ok so it's telling me that slash search is not found so I think I'm I'm making a mistake here what is my mistake ok search search dot HTML is there so it's saying that slash search it does not exist ok so I need to add my slash search to you all start be here so what I'll do is I'll say whenever somebody searches something what I need to do is I need to redirect him to sorts search view but no less so save and if I reload this page you can see here are your search results so if I start something I click search here are your search results and ok so home blog contact it works so home button is not working so I need to make this working as well so what I'll do is inside my base dot HTML I haven't entered anything in href of this of this anchor tag which has this home so now my home will work as well so you can see that all the buttons work and if I saw something say I want to search for Python so it says here are your search results obviously we need to write a lot of code to make this work and also we need to connect it to a model which will host all the C blog post all the contact details and whatever we want to store in the database so what we'll do is we'll come back to this blog and we create a model and we'll see how we'll render all these blog post in the blog post page and we'll also see how a user can come log in to the dashboard and add more and more blog posts to the block but at this point I want you guys to access playlists if you haven't already done that and also if you haven't already shared this place I want you guys to share this playlist if you share this playlist with your friends I'll be able to make videos very quickly for you so please don't forget to like this video and thank you so much guys for watching this video I'll see you next time [Music]
JO58rTZI3ak,guys previous video was fun we actually added tiny mce to a django blog without having to do many things and it was really fun to see this bold italic underline and all these options inside tinymce but do you know that we can see more options and we can get more customization from tiny mce by going to the documentation let's find out i'll simply search for tinymce and i'll go to the documentation i think here is the demo for tiny mce and they actually tell you a lot of things about tiny mce how you can add these options if you see we don't get these options so if you click at this preview you are seeing the preview here but for our case we are not seeing any preview and we would definitely love to see this preview button inside the django entering a blog okay the admin part of django blog at the same time it would be amazing to set the height of this box to something say seventy percent of the viewport height or maybe even bigger than that but definitely not this small okay so we'll see how we can customize all those things now there are a lot of plugins and people will make a lot of plugins in the future the main thing the main skill that you can learn is to look into the documentation and find out how to customize your say tiny mce or whatever software you are using as for your needs so what i'll do is i'll go and see what kind of customizations are provided by tinymce and it's showing me this javascript for this one so what i have done is i have simply added javascript which is a three line javascript i have just told that the selector is id underscore content and i want to select this but if you look into this one they are saying that we are using this we are using this we are using this a lot of options so let's see if we can grab all these options let me copy this code and let me paste it as it is so i'll get rid of my tiny mce dot init and i'll use this but at the same time i'll ensure that the selector i'm using is correct so i'll paste it here and let me see if it changes anything for me or it produces an error we'll have to ensure that it doesn't produce an error so i'll simply get rid of this one but this has definitely spoiled things for us so there are two errors it's saying that we cannot uh reference this thing we cannot so so there are some problems let's see what those problems are so they are saying mention selector mentions fetch so let me remove all these things so they are saying that tiny drive token provider i don't want to use dynee drive let me get rid of this one i just want to use these plugins i do not want to use the menu bar toolbar okay let me keep this at the same time i'll remove all these things i don't even know what these things are i just copied all the things from tinymce website so i'll remove this one and let me see if it works i just want to get it to work i don't want to dive deeper into tiny mce documentation and once again we see all these plug-in um messages that you don't have these plugins by an api key and this is really annoying who will see all these things but i think this this is really great and this is amazing and you might as well go to the website sign up for a free api key and i think if you get this api key you'll you'll see all these options and these are a lot of options i don't even know what these options are we can start exploring one by one let me select this text and this is the indentation nice what is this let me select some text and add this one okay so this is unordered list ordered list and this is an ordered list okay looks good okay looks good if i press enter another thing another thing wow this is amazing this is really amazing okay so we can choose some colors as well let me see if i can change the color nice and they have a color picker as well so you can choose any color of your choice this is really amazing and what is this page break okay so you can give a page break as well what is this oh this is a set of special symbols so you get a lot of things i'm really impressed with tiny mc while they have emojis as well i use them a lot i use them a lot while talking to friends or whenever i want to express something while i'm writing a blog they come really very handy so i'm really impressed with what tinymce has done and i can go to full screen as well this is really amazing i cannot appreciate it much preview wow this is good i think we have landed our blog to the right place and we can start writing amazing blog posts now starting my story once upon a time on new lists for dates new table so these are some templates that they have created i think you can also create some templates uh what is this insert link so if i want to link this to some uh okay so this this is insert template this is the link so i can say google.com and this is the link this this goes to google.com you can change the link as well you can ask it to open in a new tab or window wow this is amazing and what is this right to left okay or you want to go left to right insert edit code sample okay so you can add code as well this is something that i want this is something that i want because i write a lot of code and i really like inserting code and this will really come handy for me whenever i'm writing programming articles let me grab some python code from somewhere let me go to django documentation let me go to this thing and let me see if i can find out some python code from somewhere okay so i can copy this python code uh models.pv let's let's copy this and let's see how this looks here so i'll simply copy this save wow i'm really impressed by the way and this is amazing i should say and let me save this and see how my blog looks so i've saved this i'll reload this page another one and this is how it looks and yes you can customize your code by writing javascript and all those kind of stuff we'll see all these things in a future video sometime but this stuff is impressive and we can start writing amazing posts from now okay so one thing that we create problems for you is whenever you open something this tiny mce will start loading and you'll see whole bunch of these domain is not registered plug-in is not enabled all these things okay so let me see if i can remove some plugins that i'm not using that i don't want uh what is this linked list image list i don't even know what these things are let me start removing them one by one and probably i'll play around with this thing and i'll definitely learn what these things are but i think for now this is amazing and i really appreciate it a lot so if i remove all these things let me see what all options do i see i think i have made some mistake in the code i should make sure that this remains valid from code perspective so i can remove these templates i don't want these templates import css append i don't know what it is i'll remove all these things i'll remove this as well i'll remove this as well and let me keep these things only so let me save reload and the number of warnings that i'm seeing should reduce but looks like they haven't so i think we need to go and we need to start creating the free api keys whenever possible but for now what i'll do is i'll remove all the plugins that i don't need and i i'll start removing these menus as well title tiny comments at comment show comment delete all conversations what is that okay so there are some menus that can be created here they have a lot of stuff i think this is really very impressive so we can in the future play around with this and definitely we'll learn how to use this for now this has some steep learning curve uh you will have to write at least five to ten articles in order to find out how to optimally write your articles using this but this is going to be fun and also we'll have to go through the documentation and spend some time in order to find out what all options we should be using and what all options are free and we should be enabling in order to see no warnings or whatsoever so i'll leave that on you for now what i'll do is i will simply reduce the number of options in the toolbar and i'll also remove this menu i don't even know what these are doing here i have used tinymce in the past i have been using it for some time but i think i don't enable a lot of options and i don't even enable all these plugins uh plugins i'll remove this plugin and i'll also remove all these plugins i don't want to use all these plugins so i'll simply remove all the plugins and let me see how it looks and i think this is good to start with so all these are premium plugins actually i'll remove all the plugins i don't want any plugin so let me get rid of all these plugins and i think if i get rid of all the plugins this looks good to me okay so we can start with this and if we like maybe in the future if we want we can sign up for a free api key and even if we have to pay and if we start earning say three thousand dollars a month which is a lot of money if at all we are earning this amount of money in the future probably we can start giving some money to tiny mce as well i don't even know what the price of tiny mce is is there any um is there any option to see where the pricing and all those things are listed i don't know i can't find the pricing page where is the pricing page is it paid it it definitely is paid but i am not sure where pricing page is anyways okay so here is the pricing let us quickly look at the pricing so they are charging 25 dollars a month which is a lot of money community is free forever so you can use open source editor you know and love free forever and ready for commercial use so you can use this editor which is a good thing but i think the cloud plans are paid so we can use this um open source editor uh as and when required but the plugins are paid for sure so i think that is fine and we'll wrap this tiny mce but what i wanted to address through this video was i wanted to remove this paragraph tag the br tag because it doesn't look good there are two ways to remove this first way is to have a short description column here so if i add a short description column here i'll see that short description here but again you don't want to write the short description again and again you would want this chart description to be generated automatically okay so in order to do that what you can do is you can start looking into this uh whatever the html is being fetched from the database and you can analyze that html using javascript and generate the text automatically now since this is not a javascript tutorial i'll not do that because this will uh confuse you a lot if i start writing javascript so what i'll do is i'll add a short description field there so let us come back to models.py and inside the blog what i'll do is i'll say short underscore desc and i'll say models.carfield and i'll say max length is equal to how many characters should we add 300 i don't remember how many characters we added inside the blog home template so i think i have added around 200 or something i don't remember 245 so let me make it 250 okay so i'll say okay max length is 250 or maybe 300 and whenever i cross more than say 245 and that will automatically get truncated so that is totally fine with me i'll save this i'll stop the server i'll say python manage dot py make my questions [Applause] so this will make migrations i'll say uh it's saying that there is no default for this thing so what i'll do is i'll quit and add a default as well because it doesn't have a default so i'll say default is equal to none so it has added this short dse to block now i'll restart my server once again and i'll go back to my models and it is saying that no such column blog blog.desc so i think there is some problems okay so the problem is i just ran make migrations i should migrate as well because make migrations will just create the files for migration and migrate is the command which will actually do the magic of writing into the database so now the database has been changed and we'll get rid of this error hopefully so let me reload this page oh yes we have removed the error now what i'll do is i'll copy this and i'll add it to the short description and save now if i reload this still i'm seeing this thing because i am not pointing to the short underscore desc in my blog home template so i should say that i don't want blog dot content i want blog.esc and i want to slice it to 245 characters reload and this is what we see but once again we'll have to add short description to all the articles so i think it sounds like a good plan to add short description to all the articles ctrl c ctrl v and save once again i'll do the same with this article as well now you might want to go to tinymce and sign up for a free key the key is free i'm not doing it to save some time you can sign up with them and once you get the tiny mce key you can simply insert the key by looking into the documentation and if you do not want to do that that's totally fine i have ran a website without having to add the api key for like nine months i was too lazy i'm sorry but i think you should definitely add the tiny mce key it's worth it believe me learn javascript i'll add the chart description to this one as well copy paste save let me reload this yes this looks good this really looks good now the blog is looking so clean and we have this rich text editor as well i think this is the time you can take this block to production but again we have to fix some more things for example we have not added height to this one and once again we have not yet added uh static images to our to our homepage because if you don't use starting images your website is going to be slow because unsplash api is not going to give you images with that amount of speed which you can achieve using your own website using your own server so we'll come back and we'll make all these changes the home page looks good to me i think i think this looks good no problems whatsoever in my home page no problems whatsoever in the blog page except i need to add some height i need to add a form inside contact as well so we'll make sure that we have a contact page as well and once again we should have an about page as well which will tell about how mountain coders started and what kind of service mount encoders is is it uh is it a course website is it a website which will feature a lot of programming articles we will make sure we add that as well because people who are visiting the blog who are reading the articles they'll definitely want to know what you are about and what your website is about so they might come to the about page so it's a good idea to design an about page but i'll save time here because this is not a bootstrap tutorial i'll make a bootstrap tutorial if you post a comment please give us good start tutorials if if if i get say 100 comments i'll definitely make a bootstrap tool let's close the deal here 100 comments and you'll get a bootstrap tutorials on programming with harry so let me see if i get 100 comments on bootstrap tutorials and i'll show you how bootstrap 5 works in fact bootstrap 5 has come bootstrap 5 it has arrived uh let me open the documentation of bootstrap 5 alpha release and believe me bootstrap 5 is amazing i had a look at bootstrap 5 and i tried it out i don't know where the link to bootstrap 5 is ok so it's here v5 v5.getbootstrap.com and i liked it they removed jquery and they they are now using vanilla javascript this is amazing so you might want to have a look at mozart 5 but again we'll leave that to some other video i hope you're liking these django videos if you want me to continue this channel series i want you to share this playlist please because i need a lot of support on this channel i hope you guys will share this playlist with your friends and also if you haven't liked these videos i want you guys to like each and every video thank you so much guys for watching this video and i will see you next time you
7Z_ZTsop7qQ,on it against the mountain coders looked like this at this point and it is really amazing to see that we were able to create a blog of this quality in such a short span of time and it really looks good but now is the time to move towards deployment of this blog now why is deployment important when you are creating a blog with Django or some other website it is because this is how you get on boarded this is how your business gets on board if you are creating an e-commerce website or even a blog for that matter it is really important for you to get the deployment right otherwise your users will see severe downtime which might affect you indirectly or directly so let's see how we can move towards the deployment we have already seen how we structure this how we create the blog how we add the post now is the time to deploy this blog so let's get started so what I'll do is I'll click on blog and I just want to fix few things before we move towards the deployment and those things are I just want to add some minimum height I think I've already done that in contact page so let's see how we have done that so I just want to add the style to all the pages I want to have this container to have a minimum height of 90 viewport height so VH is a unit which stands for viewport height so let's add the same thing to our blog post page as well so I think we need to add it inside a blog CSS I like to call it more CSS so that it is very clear where I'm adding the CSS might even call your blog with whatever name you want so I am calling my block as CSS I'm calling this blog as block active so that's your choice okay so I think this will fix this hide issues let me reload this and yes it indeed fixes this height issue most of the time the content of a blog is going to get past this 100 VH limit so will not see any issues if we deploy it as is without adding this style but I think if we add this style it's better for us ok enough of talks I can see this none - here I think I have added some print statements which is not a good practice by the way so let me come back to views and let me see if I can get rid of these print statements here so I've printed this previous and next I should get rid of them I don't want to see any nasty statements here I don't want to see anything strange in my logs later okay so I think I have fixed that it has not yet no lead okay it has loaded now so let me reload this and let me see if it's gone yes it is so let us create a virtual environment now what is a virtual environment virtual environment is an isolated environment for your app so let us say you were deploying your Jango app in a VM inside that VM you might do something else with Python 3.8 let us say and let us say this Jango block is deployed using Python 3.5 now Python 3.5 doesn't support have strings and Python 3.8 supports have strings let us say you want to use F strings in some other project and you install Python 3.8 for that now what will happen if you upgrade your Python 23.8 this app will stop working why now let us assume there is a feature which is present in Python 3.5 but it is not present in Python 3 point unit has been deprecated you will face some issues so how do you isolate all the Python packages and create a new environment a separate environment just for this Jango app it is achieved using virtual environment so let us see you how much your environment works if you haven't accessed my Python playlist I think you should do that if you don't know what your environment and you want to learn by them I have I have talked about virtual environments if I'm not wrong I have talked about virtual environment in some of these videos you'd have to find it it's watch it from the starting this is a Python course you should definitely be accessing and let us now come back to our terminal though I am using git bash ok and I use git bash on windows because it gives me look and feel of Windows terminal I'm sorry Linux terminal so if you're already on Linux then you will definitely be seeing some other terminal you will see the Staller but if you're using Windows PowerShell there is this minor change that I'll be telling you but let us start installing virtual env so you can say pip install virtual environment I think it's virtually and V if I'm not wrong I think it's virtual env yes it is virtually env so it's already there for me but it will install for you if it's not there for you now you can say virtual env and I like to call my virtual environments as my project env then call it whatever you want you can call it Hari you can call it a Sam you can call it a Rohan you can call it whatever you want I'm calling it my project env for no good reason I'm just calling it I'm just choosing a random name and calling it as my project env as soon as you fire this command what happens is a project gets created here my project env and this is your Python environment which is isolated from your C global Python interpreter or some other virtual environment from some other project what I mean by this is my project env is a Python interpreter which I have spawned off my systems interpreter and now I'm going to use this my project env as a virtual environment this is a separate environment for this app even if I install Jango from my say base Python interpreter which is on my local disk C and Python 3.8 even if I uninstalled tryingo from there it is not going to affect me in any way because I am using a virtual environment which is isolated so let us see how to activate this virtual environment because I am still using my system interpreter so I need to tell my terminal hey terminal I want to use this my project env I no longer want to use my global Python interpreter switch settings such that whenever I say pip install you should install to this my project env so for that you say source my project env scripts and activate this will activate your virtual environment now I am using git bash okay make sure you have good bash if you are firing this command but if you are on PowerShell then you should be using a command like this my project env and then scripts and then activate dot ps1 this is the command for activating a virtual environment inside your windows powershell so if you're not using powershell and you are using git bash you can follow me but but if you are using windows powershell this is the command okay this is the command for windows powershell make sure and you then note that there is no source here okay let me press control C now I already have my my project env environment activated how do I know this I know this because I see this my project env written inside the parentheses here okay alright so far so good let us now start firing clip install Chango because we don't have django installed inside this my project env my django has started installing but at the same time what i'll do is i'll create a new file called the requirements dot txt what is requirements dot txt and why did I create this I created this requirements dot txt so that I can know what all these packages inside this requirements dot txt and in the future if at all I want to replicate this environment if I want to create this virtual environment once again I know which packages were installed inside this virtual environment and I can refer to this requirements dot txt there is a command as well which will install all the packages from a given requirements dot txt we talked about that let it install so it is installed Chango so I'll simply say Django but at the same time I'll also note down the version of Django that I installed so I'll say double equals two and then I'll go down the version of Django which is three point zero point eight so I'm saying install Django version number three point zero point eight is there anything else that I need to install let me peek into my views dot py I don't think I have use any other package so if you're using any external package like pandas numpy let us assume we are using pandas I'm not using it but let us assume we are using it and simply say pip install pandas so it is installing pandas let it install pandas will give it this time and once pandas is installed you will note down the version of pandas that it is installed so come on come on come on I don't know why it's so slow it used to install very fast previously I don't know why it's getting slow I think my machine is getting slower day by day I need to upgrade maybe ok so let me find out the version of pandas so it's 1 point 0.5 I'll simply say double equals 2 and I'll paste the version number okay now we have these two packages inside inside our virtual environment now if you want to get out of your virtual environment you can use this deactivate command and this will take you out of your virtual environment now why did I make this requirement start exe you must be thinking why did we note these packages we noted this packages so that we can recreate this my project env are you getting it let us say I delete this and I'm pressing delete you must be thinking hey don't do that but no on deleting it I deleted it ok as you saw I deleted my project E and V so if I try to activate this it will not activate it'll say there is no directly called my project env so what I'll do is I'll recreate this my project yeah me now you don't have to do it you don't have to delete it I deleted it just to show you how we can quickly recreate the environment with the same packages using the acquirements dot txt so we have this my project env back now what I'll do is I'll say pip install - R - R means installed from this file take all the packages which are there inside this file and simply install them one by one so if I press ENTER you collect all these packages from requirements dot txt file and you'll start installing it in wherever environment you are if you are inside your virtual environment start installing these packages in your virtual environment if you are in your system interpreter it will install all these packages inside your system interpreter so it depends upon where you are so it is installing these packages for me I hope I activated my virtual environment I didn't activate my virtual environments my bad I should have activated my virtual environment so this is a mistake I made by the way I fired this command without activating the virtual environment so it's actually installing all these packages in Mike Lowell system interpreter but that's why I let it do it let it do it what I'll do is I'll simply go to my command history and I'll activate this virtual environment now if I install pip install - our requirements dot txt once I fire this command now all these packages will be installed in this environment previously I didn't had this environment activated so it installed all the packages from requirements dot txt on my system interpreter okay so let us wait for these packages to install and once these packages are installed we have on my project env ready and once we activate all my project env we can start using our django app we can start firing python managed or py run server it will definitely create a server for us and we will look into all these things so I'm just waiting for this to finish come on come on come on and what I'll do is I already have this my project env activated I will simply fire Python manage dot py or run server and it will start a development server at 8000 ok now it is about to be finished I think I should pause the video and come back once it is finished I don't know why but it really took some time for it to complete I think my PC has gotten very slow if you have some good hardware configuration maybe you'll be able to install it very fast at least faster than me now what I do is I have this project my project env activated what I'll do is I'll save Python manage dot py run server and it'll start the development server so let me click on this and let me click on blog contact home blog contact it works as expected I just want to make a change I want to change this color - BTN primary so I want to come back to my templates based on HTML and this one replaces the success with primary control is to save and let me reload this and yes it looks fine I think I should not make it outline I should make it darker version of this so instead of BD an outline primary these are all bootstrap classes by the way we have talked a lot about bootstrap so I think it should not be a problem for you at this point I'll come back to blog and now the color of a blog is kind of blueish so it looks fine having it looks way better than before and I think it is ready for deployment now let us go back to our terminal and see how we are going to deploy this okay so the very first step that you should be taking before deploying is pushing your blog to get now git is something that makes a lot of developers uncomfortable but people who really know how to use git they really love kit and I personally really love kid I don't know how I would have managed had there been no gate so create a file called dot git ignore if you don't know what it is no need to worry seriously it's super simple I'll show you how simple it is so you just have to say dot git ignore and I'll put in the name of the folders that I want to ignore my project env is something I want to ignore I don't want to use this my project env inside my repository because I know that I can create this huge folder anytime using this requirements dot txt file so I don't want to push it at the same time I don't want to push this DV dot sequel i3 because it's going to grow with time and I don't want to push it I want to use first of all I'll be using another database that I'll show you very soon but once again I just want to put this TB dot sequel id3 [Applause] ctrl s to save I don't want to push this TV dots equal I'd three to my gate is there anything else that I wanna ignore yes I wanna ignore this dot vs code because this is a folder created by Visual Studio code and why would I push this as a part of this project definitely not I'm not going to push this to github okay I'll see and once I save this what I'll do is I'll simply initialize this project so I'll say get in it now you don't have to use gate but I just want to initialize this as a git repository and push it to get if you are getting uncomfortable I just want to stop and not use git because you might get uncomfortable and thing why would I teach get inside a Chango project but believe me it is super simple so let us just initialize the repository and I will explain you what it will do so once you say get in it it will initialize this repository as a git repository and you are just saying that this folder is now a git repository can you see this my project E and V and DV dot C collide three greyed out this simply means that these two folders are inside git ignore and get is not tracking them okay once you change any file they'll be tracked by git so you can keep changing the files and all the changes will be tracked and you can roll back and it's really an awesome tool will come up get in some other video someday but at this point just fire two commands blindly get ad dot will add all the files to staging area and git commit minus M initial commit this will create a commit and why I'm using gate here I'm using it just to track my project with time I'll be changing my files a lot and I want them to be tracked by git this is because I don't want to see anything wrong happening while I'm coding and deploying things okay so this is something that I want to do and I think this is it for now I will come back in the next video and show you how to deploy this Django blog inside a VM I hope you got the concept of virtual environment and it is really super simple to use a virtual environment in my opinion if you haven't already accessed my Django playlist I think you should definitely access it because this is a place where I've added all the videos and this is a place where I have step-by-step explained you all the things we have created project in increasing level of difficulty so I hope you will enjoy if you access this playlist so if you haven't already like this video I want you guys to like this video please and thank you so much guys for watching this video and I will see you next time [Music]
ig532b4WkQc,alright guys now is the time that we move on to our next project and this project is going to be a blog this is because most of you guys wanted me to create a blog so I will create a blog so in order to create a new Django project what I'll do is I'll simply open Django documentation so I'll say in Django tutorial and this is the Django documentation so as you can see I have opened this page and to be very honest I remember all the commands at this point but maybe in the future say one year down the line I might not remember all the commands so what I do is I strongly recommend this website you open this web page and copy this command Django admin start project my site or whatever the name of the site whatever the name of your site is so what I'll do is I'll simply right-click and shift right link and open partial window here if you are on Ubuntu or Mac OS or some other operating system you might want to open terminal in your operating system and what I'll do is I'll simply piece this Django admin start project my side in my case what I'll do is I'll say my blog so in my case the name of my website is going to be my blog ok and I'll give it an interesting name so a name that comes to my mind at this point is mount team mountain Poulos so this is a name that I'm choosing randomly feel free to choose your name and I'll press Enter key and this will create a project a Django project for me the name of the project is mountain kudus ok and this vlog is going to contain some sort of blog post I should be having an admin panel where I can add a lot of blog posts so this is the project that I created so what I'll do now is I'll open this particular folder envious code so I'll right-click and click open with code as you can see this mountain coders folder has been opened at this point and what I'll do now is I click on terminal and new terminal and I'll have my terminal over here so I can create a lot of apps inside this a particular folder I have discussed about the difference between app and a project and you should be knowing a lot about apps and projects and what the difference between two is at this point if you have watched this playlist if you haven't already access this playlist I want you guys to access this playlist click here to bookmark it and click here to save it so that you can make this playlist yours and you can get the best out of this playlist so what I'll do now is I'll open the Django documentation and I'll find the command to create a new app so our project on itself cannot have views so what we need to do is we need to create some apps in order to give it a view in order to have some pages and in order to make our block functional okay so what I'll do is I'll copy this Python manage store people star a polls from here and I'll paste it here and in order to make a blog what I'll do is I'll call my app as blog so I want a block folder here so I'll say okay Python management people start a blog so mounting qoodles is a project and blog is an app what I'll do at this point is I'll come to you all start py off mountain coders and I'll select a Python interpreter here if you haven't already selected it shows me this sort of error all the time because I have multiple versions of Python installed maybe you'll not see this error so I'll do is I'll create a new URL I'll say ok do one thing whenever somebody comes with a blank URL pattern you do one thing you redirect that person to you all start be my off blog so it'll send the request to you I'll store py off blog so what I'll do is I'll simply copy this one and I'll paste it here so everything has already been done for me they have already given me all the commands and I can easily copy paste all these commands so they really make it very easy for a person to create a blog and create pages like this so what I'll do is I'll import included as well so I'll say Django dot Ewell's import path and include because I'm using this include and I want to switch to blog Turtles now fortunately this blog and this blog is same for me but if you are calling your app with some other name you might want to write the name of your app over here and do not write blog always blog is not a convention I hope it is very clear this is not blog this is the name of this app whatever the name of your app is will be coming here okay now what will happen is I'll change this one so whenever somebody comes with some URL pad and if I say take me to say Mountain chorus calm slash home what this ul pattern will do is it will say okay you are saying home it doesn't matches this one this is a blank so what I'll do is I'll send your request to blocks you all start py now will come to blocks you all start py which is definitely not present at this point so I'll create a new file called you all start py inside my blog ok and what I'll do now is I'll copy this one and I will paste it here and I'll remove everything from here and what I'll do is I'll say ok if something matches home you do one thing you redirect that person and show him the view what I mean by this is if the string which matches is nothing that means somebody has visited Mountain chorus calm you might want him to see home function from view store py so what I'll do is I'll come to my view start py and I'll say def home request and I'll simply say ok I want to return her simply input this one HTTP response steeply response this is home now this HTTP response is really very useful if you want to create some sort of skeleton so what I am doing at this point is I'm creating and a skeleton for my Jango app so I've created this home function and also I have created this UN pattern wherein I'm saying that whenever somebody visits the home page of my website he should be directed to Rios dot home in order to use this views I need to import it so I'll say from blog import views so it will go to this blog folder and it will import views from this blog I'll ctrl s to save and I'll say Python man you should not be my run server if you don't remember this command what you can do is you can always come here and you can copy this command from here and paste it so if you don't spend much time working with Django you might forget all the commands in that case feel free to use this as a reference page and copy and paste the commands from here so what I'll do now is I'll open this 127.0.0.1 and I will press my ctrl and click it and as you can see I'm seeing this this is home here so this is my home page now what I want is whenever somebody clicks on blog he should be redirected to my blog home so I also want to create another endpoint and the name of that endpoint should be long so I'll save use dot blog and I'll see if somebody matches blog then you need to take him to view start blog and I need to create this function as well I don't have a blog function so what I'll do is I'll create this blog function I'll say def blog and this is blog so if somebody comes to my website slash blog he sees this as blog I might also want to have a contact because if something goes wrong in my blog I want people to contact me through this page so I'll say okay if you want to contact me you can simply use this slash contact endpoint and you can contact me and let me know whatever the problem in my blog is or whatever the problem you are facing or something else you want to tell me so if I go to slash contact you can see this page this is basically this view this is not a plain text this is this view and saying that return HTTP response with this string as part of this view so whenever somebody executes this contact we he'll see this is contact on the screen I might also render a template I'm not doing that at this point but I might do that and I will do that in the future but at this point I want to create bare-minimum blog I want to create my blog with bare minimum end points with zero design and then as a part of my next step I'll add the design to this blog okay so what I'll do now is I'll create another end point and I'll call this end point as the most important and point of the blog and it is the main page of the blog so if I have some blog post inside my blog let us say the title of my blog post is Django crash course so what I've warned is whenever somebody visits my slash blog post slash Django tutorial he should be shown the page containing the Django tutorial note this is a part which we haven't yet discussed so what I'll do is I'll create this end point and you'll understand everything so I'll simply say blog post and it will take a parameter which is called slug and another one is this the request and what I'll do is I'll say a return HTTP response and after HTTP response I'll say you are viewing and then I'll say slug and this will contain the slug it might be Django tutorial or C tutorial or whatever the slug off my blog post is now if you don't know what slug is I'll show you an example so we'll go to some blog over the Internet and we'll look into the example of slug so as you can see that there is this blog and if I open this article from this blog and this article from this blog then you see this thing this is the slug story slash this dot HTML is the slug story slash this dot HTML is the slug and in some of the blogs what you'll see is this love is some sort of a text so as you can see let me open this watch blog if I open one page from this watch and another from this word you can see this is the slug this is what I'm talking about this is the slug so this is some sort of text which shows up in the URL and at the same time this uniquely corresponds to a post so you can uniquely define a post using this text so this is the slug so what I do is I'll pull this slug from the database and I'll pull the corresponding block from the database and I'll populate a template but that thing is something which will be done in the future at this point I just want to have a function I just want to have this slug and I want to render this slug inside this as this string inside this HTTP response so in order to do that what I'll do is I'll say okay if somebody comes to blog post and slash some sort of string and I'm calling that string slug you need to take him to views dot blog post okay and this is the view start blog post and if I go to blog post slash say Django if I go to blog post slash Django it is saying got multiple values for argument slug let me see what the problem is so it's saying that blog post got multiple values for argument slug okay so I need to have this request first and slug later and now I should be able to view this so it's saying you are viewing Django if I say Django tutorials you can see you are viewing triangle tutorials so what I'm basically doing is I am parsing the URL entered by the user and this parameter after the blog post can be stored inside a variable called slug and I'll have this variable available inside my views so what I didn't do is send my views is I can have some sort of database queries which will execute during the runtime and find out whether there is some sort of post with this slug inside my mount in CODIS database or not now at this point this might sound really very confusing but bear with me this is going to be the page which will they in the blogpost this is going to be the blog page this is going to be the informative page which will contain all the information about a particular blog post so what we'll do is inside the blog we'll add a lot of blog posts and whenever somebody wants to read a blog post he need to visit this view in order to read that particular blog post so so a slug will map to some sort of blog inside the database and I can dynamically extract that blog out using the slug so I'll have this slug and I can use the slug to dynamically query my database and extract out all the information corresponding to that slug and the blog post so if the slug is say let me have an example from this divorce com if the slug is Facebook group recommendation update less moderators what I'll do is I'll go to my database I will query my database for the slug and I'll fetch all this title this particular thing there's text or the images and whatever is being shown up inside the speech can be queried from the database and this template can be populated if you can see this page and compare it with this page you will see that they have populated some sort of template so this is some sort of template being populated with different titles you can see the title here is different and the title here is different but the overall design remains the same so what they are doing is they're using some sort of template inheritance I'm just guessing it they are using some sort of template inheritance and they are populating only the parts which are variable in the template now this website might not be built using trying to be very honest but if this is built using Django then this is a variable this is a variable and all this is a variable we'll see how we structure a Django blog with these concepts okay so what I'll do now is and simply leave this as is and in my upcoming videos I will tell you how we can replace all these things with the template and how we'll create a model such tab you can pull the content for a particular blog post from our database okay so at this point I want you guys to access this playlist if you haven't already and please show me some support on this course so that I can upload the videos quickly and make sure you like this video guys thank you so much guys for watching this video and I will see you next time [Music]
79RPkGS7IPs,alright guys so so far we talked about a lot of projects we did to-do lists we talked about a lot of Django concepts we created models we saw admins we saw how to add apps to install apps now we'll get into user authentication using Django now what is user authentication you must be thinking who why is this topic even important whenever you are creating an app of say some sort of complexity you will definitely have a love-in system at place ok so whenever your app needs to authenticate users you might have to write user stable users and then you might have to write some sort of Python scripts in order to handle that login that we call it handle login so the thing is that this user authentication is so common thing that Django guys don't want you to do this they say that we have it you can simply use an authentication system and customize it as per your needs so we'll use Django's user authentication system so why use Django is user authentication system so the reason for using Django sort integration system is that it's better it's evolved over the period of years it is better to use existing tools which are already evolved which people have already tested and it's always better not to reinvent the wheel ok until unless you want to learn something you might want to reinvent something but if you are working on some project and you have strict deadlines you will definitely not want to reinvent the wheel ok so this is one of the reasons why we use Django's user authentication system another reason to use Django's user authentication system is its robustness it is really very robust it's a very very robust and it is really very easy to use you you can plug it into any of your apps and it will work just fine ok so we will use the Django authentication system to create users who can join and use the - dues list up so we will do that in the later videos or rather we'll create some other app if that is required we'll you what we'll do but this is doable we can simply add authentication system toward to do this tap ok so Django the authentication system handles both authentication and authorization now I want to emphasize on this thing because this in a CAD mix is asked a lot this question is really very important when it is asked from an interview point of view authentication and authorization are two different terms with different meanings we'll see what these things mean so authentication means how to verify a user who he claims to be an authorization means is this user authorized to do something or not now you must be thinking that I have already used a term in the definition but let me explain this authentication means that my email ID is Harry at the rate programming with Harry calm my password is H a at the rate R R star star and if I enter this user ID and password am I allowed to access facebook.com/ or not if the details are correct I will be authenticated I will be logged into the system but once I am logged into the system authorization determines so what I can do can I change Mark Zuckerburg profile inside Facebook after logging into Facebook obviously not I'm not allowed to do that that comes under authorization so what you're allowed to do is authorization and whether you are in or not is called authentication so usually this authentication term is used to refer both of these tasks but will simply use authentication in our later videos I just wanted to emphasize on this fact because this is something which is asked when somebody takes interviews in big companies and all so this is something which is emphasized upon so I just wanted to tell you ok so let's see what it provides now the auth system consists of users permissions groups and a password hashing system and a pluggable back-end system having said that you can always customize your Chango app to write on top of this authentication system now what does this if you have the password hashing system if you have some system at place which is able to say store user models and all the profiles all the emails passwords and all those things you can always customize a Django authentication model the Django auth model and you can add some more things if you want for instance if I'm making any commerce application I can simply add the shipping address inside the user profile but does it provide shipping editors by default into authentication system obviously not because there might be somebody who will never use this shipping address as a part of Django's authentication system if you are making a to-do list what does shipping address even mean introduced is definitely nothing so what Django says is we'll give you a generic system some sort of values like user username user email user password all these things will be the fields which would be used by almost all the backend systems all the authentication back-end systems and then if you need something else you can write on top of this you can customize the existing Django user authentication system okay now let us see what it provides so the authentication system consists of users it is a person who is trying to log in and then permissions what that user is allowed to do and then there is something called groups in the authentication system groups means you can simply group people and give them some sort of permissions so that is called group and then a password hashing system now if you don't know what hashing is I'll give you a very quick and brief overview if you stole users username say Harry and let us say my password is H a at the rate for let us say this is my password and let us say you were storing this username and password into the users table if somehow your users table is stolen listen to me very carefully if somehow you user's table is stolen let me call this table as users so this is user stable or model or whatever you want to call it this is users table in the database if at all this user stable is stolen by some hacker he can simply access my username and password go to the website homepage and he can login and provide a lot of damage to me I don't want that okay so if you want to escape from this damage what you can do is you can hash the password now what is hash hash is a one-way system hash is a function you can give it password it will give you hash let me call it hash function if you input password into the hash function it will give you hash when we call it password hash but if you go to the hash function and ask him the password corresponding to a hash it will say now hash is a one-way function I can't give you the password so what we do is we go to this hash function we calculate hash of a password and store the hash instead of password so we don't sort password we store the password hash hash is a one-way function so let us say my password is H a at the rate for the password hash will look something like one BCD seven nine something something something a very very long string and I'll store this very long string into the database okay now once I do that once I store the password hash into the database now listen to me very carefully if at all my user stable is stolen and a hacker has access to my username and password he will not be able to login through this website why will he not be able to login he'll not be able to login and because he doesn't have the password he has the password hash if you enter password hash in place of say password the hash will be converted to another hash which will be hash of hash and will not match the hash and hence your user will not be hacked I hope I explained this so if you store username and password it is a bit risky if you stood username and password hash so whenever users are signing up you can simply say that okay give me your password calculate the hash and store the hash instead of password and when somebody's trying to log in you say give me a username and give me your password so you match the username from here and then you calculate the hash of the inputted password dynamically and then you match the hash with the hash which is already there in the table okay so this way you can protect your users so this is a configurable password hashing system the best part about Django or the indication system is that it automatically handles all all these things for you so you already have the hashing system at place you already have the crooks read place permission binaries that place username stable at place everything is there you have a pluggable back-end system we already saw Django admin and how awesome it is so these kind of awesome things make Django more awesome okay now there are something called forms and view tools that we'll look into we can restrict particular user from accessing something and we can do a lot of customization that we'll definitely see in the future videos now let's talk about what's not included what is included is good we already talked about it but what is not included is equally important so authentication system in Django aims to be very generic so as I told you that shipping address is not there in the user authentication system because shipping address is not generic it's specific to e-commerce websites but if you want to say an authentication to your to do list you'll definitely want to have some sort of generic authentication system so that it is lightweight and easy to use at the same time so Django is generic and the authentication system of Django is generic and it doesn't provide some features commonly found in web authentication systems now what are those features which can be included in the Django authentication system but they are not by default included I'll talk about those features one of the features is password strength checking if you try to input password say admin I think it checks for length it's very basic password strength checking in Django but there's no advanced password strength checking they don't tell you whether your password is weak moderate or very strong so this is something where Django doesn't shine somebody might come sign up with a very weak password and simply he might get hacked because of this but again you can encourage your users to use very strong passwords depending upon the sensitivity of the data that you are storing in the application also you can add this as another layer inside your views not py file and you can simply do that by checking the password string using if and you can say if the password is not say 8 characters long you can simply get back to user and say hey please we need a stronger password sorry about that ok you can ask him to the enter a new password now throttling of login attempt so what is this this is simply blocking users who are trying to hack the database blocking hackers who are trying to access the website if somebody comes to my website okay somebody comes to my website he enters username Harry and let us say password 1 2 3 ok it fails now he tries to enter at the same time he tries to enter 7 7 2 now at the same time he tries to enter Harry password now again he tries to enter admin what is he trying to do he's trying to hack the system he's trying to get into the system now Django has nothing at place to check for this if somebody is trying to say login 400 times in the last 1 hour we should be blocking that person but Django doesn't do that by default this is called throttling of login attempts throttling is a concept which is very broadly used in api's if you want to overuse some sort of API it will throttle it will say hey you have been using me for the last say 1 hour or 2 hours and you have been making a lot of requests lately you are not allowed now for some time say for 24 hours or say 10 hours so you can throttle the login attempt so you can block the user from accessing the account for 1 hour 2 hours or depending upon the sensitivity even for eight nine hours okay so if we use an Android phone let me know if you use an Android phone if you use an Android phone and you try to get into somebody's phone utley throttle say hey now try after two minutes you have been trying a lot you have tried a lot of patterns the phone has not opened yet which means that you might be a hacker and you are you might want to try all the possible patterns and get into the phone you are not allowed for two minutes three minutes or whatever the throttling configuration is okay so this is called throttling of login items which Django doesn't come with but you can definitely write some sort of custom back-end to handle this thing now authentication against third parties let us say login by a Google login by a facebook login via some other company which might get famous in the future so all those things are not included and it really makes sense to me to not include all those things in such a lightweight authentication system okay now object level permissions these are some sort of specific permissions that you might want to add so any kind of permission you want to add you can simply include it as part of user profile or as part of some other model which has one-to-one relation with user profile now these things might sound haunting to you at first but we'll look into the authentication system we'll code we'll see how to create a user how to create choose a password and once we do all those things you'll definitely appreciate these concepts so I hope you understood the Django authentication system I just told you the theory we will definitely talk about all these things in code and we'll code all these things we design an app which will use Django authentication system so stay tuned for that and if you haven't already accessed this playlist I want you guys to access this playlist at this point you can click here to bookmark and click here to save this playlist and I'll get back and create an app using Django authentication system very very soon in this playlist so if you haven't already liked the video please make sure to like it and also subscribe to the channel if you haven't already thank you so much guys for watching this video and I will see next time [Music]
DR0Kbx1N1TU,alright guys so thanks for all the love and support you guys have been showing to this Chango playlist so if you haven't already access this django course i want you guys to do this immediately because this is going to be the place where and i'll upload all the videos and even if i come up with some new projects you'll find them here so it's a good idea to access this django playlist having said that what i'll do is i'll fire python manage dot P Vai run server and once I do this my development server will be started and as you can see that we had this hello form submitted false but it was kind of not looking very nice but we can make it even better so I want you guys to listen to me for some time and let's talk about Django template language this part might get a little boring but this is the most important part if you are going to work with Django templates in the future so the Django has a documentation page on Django template language and loading the page and once it opens I will show you so this Django template language is basically the kind of logic and all the manipulation with the data and that you can do inside the template so for instance I will show you something so let us say I want to add a task I want to say go to the shop ok please go and meet the tailor at the shop ok and I'll say submit so form submit it true as you can see it's showing me form has been submitted and once I reload this page you can see form submitted false so basically in my index dot HTML the value of this success is either true or false now in HTML you cannot handle if else else if these kind of logics you cannot even write loops inside HTML but Django powers this HTML with some sort of logic so using DTL which is Django template language you can inject the logic inside the HTML temple so I can basically say if so what I'll do is I'll remove the success just see what i'm doing here i'm removing this variable which is success and i'm saying that only if success is to show this alert okay so i'll say if and once i type if you can see this extension that i installed is suggesting me this thing so i'll say if success if success means if success is to and once I press tab please listen to me very carefully this part is really very important might get confusing for beginners that's why I'm asking you to listen to me really very carefully so I said if success and I pressed my tab key on my keyboard now I can press ENTER and I can basically move this and if downwards you might as well copy/paste or if you are on some other code editor you can type this somehow you don't have to install this Django HTML extension this is not a necessity it's just the utility that you can use to type faster okay so I hope you got that now once I select this and press tab I can basically get this ending and what I'm saying here is I'm saying if success only if success is true if I'm visiting the page with the get request success is false only if I am submitting the form and was ending the page using post request success is going to be true okay so since success is false by default if I go to my home I'll not see any alert now I'll say jQuery tutorial for beginners let's learn jQuery and if I submit you guys can see it shows me hello form submitted so what I'm basically doing is I am saying if this variable is true show me this thing or basically show this thing whatever it is in this case it is an alert in your case it might be something else we can use the same kind of logic in future I can also write elsif along with this if but it's not my use case at this point so I'm saying if success show this alert so basically I'll say success and then I'll say your task has been added to the list and once I do that I'll show you guys I'll reload this I'll say tasks I'll say tasks is that you have to eat some food okay submit and suckss your task has been added to the list and you can also dismiss this and this is powered by bootstrap as I already told you if you have access to spillage you know what I'm talking about all right guys so we are pretty much done with our adding tasks but we need to dive deeper into the TPL which is Django template language so as you guys can see that this extending of templates and template inheritance is also not HTML feature this is also being powered by Django templates if you remember I told you what template inheritance in Django is and you guys now know how to extend templates from a base template and then add the HTML of your choice on top of that base template okay now if you guys want to truncate words you can use something called template filters okay so if I search Jango tags and filters you'll get a list of built in tags and filters now what is this built-in tag or built-in filter basically you get some sort of these things you can enclose your text with these things and if you for instance in close your let us say I copy this and then close some sort of text with this I'll paste so this is basically a comment comment means that it will not be processed further we know that we have HTML comments as well but if you want to have comments within DTL you can put your comments the difference between DTL comment and an HTML comment is that your HTML comment will show up when somebody goes to your page sorts so if I save this I'll show you guys I'll save this and I'll go to right click view page source and if I search this particular thing let me write something unique here paddy is good okay so I'm typing this if I search this here it will not be found it says it's not found zero out of zero matches but but but if I rather say use HTML template not HTML template I mean HTML comment so she will come and look something like this and then you need to do something like this so if I save this then you will see that I can see this inside I'll say continue and I'll say ctrl F and Harry is good is here so you can see the HTML comments in your page source but you cannot see Django comments in your page source the reason is the Django template is dynamically processed and this is processed when you inject some sort of data from views to HTML and then it basically converts it to one single HTML page and while it does that it doesn't take this comment into account the Django template language comment into account so this is basically how you can add some sort of logic and you can add some sort of filters we'll explore these template tags and filter in the future but I'll show you something I'll simply say I will create a variable basically I'll say name then I'll say Harry okay so I'm basically adding a name Harry and I'm passing this context so if I visit this page I should be having this name Harry inside my index dot HTML so I'll say welcome to those lists and then I'll say comma name and this will basically show Harry if I reload this you can see it's showing me Harry because I'm using this name name is Harry inside my context at the same time I want to point out something right here you can see that I didn't enclose this success with these the braces do you know why because we already have this block so according to detail syntax when you want to reference a variable you can simply say double curly braces and name of the variable and this will actually indicate that you are going to use this name variable and you don't mean name by this so you're telling with Django template hey Django template you know what I want to use the same variable I don't want to enter name I want to use the name variable but inside if Django already knows that you're writing DTL because you have enclosed this F with these things percent curly brace so basically you are already inside details index so you don't have to enclose it with curly braces this is something that you need to keep in your mind okay now what I want to show you is if I use a template tag if I say name length I can use this template tag and I can reload and you can see it's showing me five so there are a lot of template tags and filters and if I show you another one it will be I will randomly pick something I think one is called uppercase or something it's called upper so basically when you install this Django extension you'll not have to remember all these filters you just type upper press ENTER and you'll get the required filter so if I make it upper you can see that let me reload this this is converted to uppercase okay similarly we have lower as well so if I say lower or not load it's called over and let me create this as capital H because you know what if this is already in lowercase there's no use of this filter so what I'm going to do here is I want to convert this name to partial uppercase easily I am capitalizing this name and if I reload this you'll see that it has been converted to all uppercase okay so if you want to convert something to uppercase or lowercase you can use upper or lower filter okay so I hope this thing is clear and I this thing to the description and if I forget to link this in the description please let me know in the comment also you will simply search this Django template tags and filters and once you do that you can simply open this django page whatever the stable version is three point one three point zero three point zero one the versioning doesn't usually matter a lot at this point the stable version is 3.0 but it might get to a point where you'll have three point one the stable version is actually three point one at this time it's preview release and it'll be released very soon but i have come across many people who come to me who say hey Harry you know what your tutorials are in Django three point one and Django three point two has come and you know what they are now useless I want to tell you it's not useless at all if you go from three point one to three point two there is a minor change the change will not even matter to you you'll not even know what the change is the change will be to the advanced feature basics remains the same most of the times okay so make sure that even if you are following this tutorial and the Django version goes to three point eight or four point one it should not matter much okay so once we have this thing I think we are good I don't want to include this name Luber I'll simply remove this one this was just for you know I just wanted to show you something so I'll remove this or rather what I'll do is for code sake I'll comment this and this also demonstrate the use of comment so I've commented this line out and I'll simply say I don't need this kinda less to save I don't need the comma as well now if I reload this I think we are good the next step now for me is to pull my tasks from the database and the database is this one it's the sequel light I'm using the sequel light database in Django under the hood is managing all the crud operations crud operations mean create read update and delete all the killed operations are being handled by Django okay so I hope you guys understood what I wanted to tell you in the next videos what we'll do is we create the pipeline for patching all the data from models and I want you guys to explore these tablet text and filters please and let me know in the comments if you will do that or not I really like it when people comment on my videos so please drop a comment and if you haven't accessed this playlist please make sure to access this playlist and also like this video this also makes me a lot happier so that's it for now guys thank you so much you guys for watching this video and I will see you next time [Music]
GkJgDfI17ec,alright guys so to-do list app looks awesome at this point let me find a Python managed or py run server viton managed or py hood run server and once I fire this command I'll be able to start my development server before I start the server before I go to the link with my app is started I want you guys to access this playlist if you haven't already done that I want you guys to bookmark it and save it so that you can have it and watch the videos that you want if you want to come for a quick revision or whether you want to look for some syntax or something you should have this playlist at your disposal having said that I'll start my website which is a to do list app and we saw that we can add this is the ESC and once I submit it has been added and it reflects here so I would like to talk about some of the customizations that is possible inside the students list app firstly we don't have a foot on here so what we can do is we can add a footer so in order to add the footer what I'll do is I'll certainly come to my index dot HTML and I'll add a footer in order to add the footer I'll simply say footer and I'll simply say copyright 2020 and then I'll say all rights reserved or something reserved and you can simply say P dot text Center if you say P door text Center what actually happens is you can use this bootstrap class to Center everything and you can basically bring everything to the center so let me show you how this looks so if I reload this page you can see everything is at the center of the page in order to make it look a little more better I can simply say BG dark and this will look duh but in order to make this visible I'll have to make the color of this text white so what I'll do is I'll say text like so in bootstrap white is called light so I'll reload this page and you can see that I have this footer then there is something called I think the name of the glass is sticky footer if I'm not wrong now there are some of the classes which are difficult to remember so I'll simply say sticky footer bootstrap I think it's put a bottom or something I'm not sure what it is called so in order to search for that class let me look for that class okay so the class is called fixed bottom so what I'll do is I'll add this fixed bottom class it's not sticky footer my bad it's fixed bottom and you don't have to remember all these classes believe me you can simply look into some sort of you know you can simply Google search or you can look into some sort of cheat sheet or something when at this point we'll simply save this and I'll see whether this works and I can see that it has reached the bottom of the page but I can see some margin here let me see where this margin is coming from this margin is coming from this paragraph so if I add margin bottom or say if I add margin zero margin becomes zero so I can simply say my0 or mb0 but at the same time i want to add some padding so what I'll do is I'll say set margin to zero but set padding to three so this will basically add some padding and it will increase the size of my footer as you can see so these are some ways to get this text at the center of the page and design your footer accordingly there are a lot of other ways to design the footer but since the footer was missing from the speech I just wanted to design it at the same time what I'll do is I'll copy this footer and simply paste it inside my task dot HTML so let me do that as well and you can see that we have this footer inside at a store HTML as well so copyright when you ID all rights reserved you can change the text you can change how this looks there are a lot of ways you can customize you can simply add at the rate I think it's copy let me try so you noted the rate it's ampersand copy semicolon and this inserts a copyright symbol yes it so you can simply search HTML symbols and you can get a lot of these symbols so there are a lot of reference websites this being one of those and there are a lot of symbols that you can use and copyright was just one of those so I use this one ampersand copy you can use ampersand reg you know trade Larr then a lot of other HTML symbols so you can simply look for these HTML symbols and you can use those in your website so the to-do list looks amazing to me at this point you can add some JavaScript if you want you can add some sort of event listener if you know what an event listener is event listener will simply listen for change event inside this textbox so so this is an input with type is equal to text and if you add something inside this input tag let us say I add a angle I would want this Jango to come up and I don't want this to show up this to show up or anything which doesn't contain Jango to show up this should show up and once again this should show up and anything which contains Jango in title or description should show up so I can simply add some sort of bootstrap or C CSS class and I can say that the visibility of that particular row is hidden hide that true or maybe make it none make the display of that particular Road none and show only those rows which contain this thing so if you want to search for something inside your tasks and then you can do that very efficiently similarly inside an ideal to do list app you will need a delete button as well because if you don't have your delete button your list will keep going keep going keep going and it will keep going at the point when it will be very very difficult for you to scroll down so you need a delete button you need an update button you can add those end point so I want to give you a quiz at this point I want you guys to add an update button here and it we button here and once somebody clicks on the delete button this app should actually make requests to an end point so you can create an end one call delete and update and once you do that you should be able to delete or update the item of your choice okay so let me tell you how you can do that you can simply have an endpoint slash delete if this doesn't look idle to you if this looks haunting to you then I want you guys to watch this playlist till the end and you will get an idea of how to do that because there are a lot of other concepts that we'll just explore further since this is a to-do list app I just wanted to tell you how this can be customized further and how can this be made better so these are some of the ways you can make this to-do list better and the same thing what you can do is you can simply add some sort of vacuum images here those will look definitely good and you can remove this search bar from here because it doesn't make any sense to keep a search bar here so let me do it right away so I'll go to my index dot HTML and what I'll do is I'll simply remove this search part from the nav so here is my navigation I'll remove this form and I'll save this so once I do that you can see this search has been removed from here but I want to keep it inside my tasks you might as well move this search from here to here so once you have this search from here to here it'd look good so another thing I want to talk about is data tables now you might think what is stated APIs if you know what jQuery is if you want some jQuery plug-in to take care of your pagination stuff you can use data tables data tables is a very amazing tool you all you need to do is you need to include CSS upgraded tables you need to include JavaScript of little tables and you need to include jQuery obviously and then after that you can simply add the ID of your table and you can copy this thing and your table will look like so if you have say thousand entries inside your table this speech will become very very huge and your users will not have a good experience navigating through the entire page so in order to solve the problem you can use this plugin and you can simply you know add this thing and you will have this kind of navigation and it really looks very clean and this will give you a free search bar as well so if I say Mykel Mykel and you can have whatever matches okay so this is amazing tool we'll see how to use it I just wanted to call this out because you might want to finish this to-do list app right away so you can use this as well so these were some of the ways which you can use to customize your to-do list application you might as well add some of the about services or maybe authentication inside the entire app but we haven't talked about authentication just yet so what we'll do is we'll talk about all these concepts in our further videos so I want you guys to access this playlist as soon as possible if you haven't done that already I want you guys to bookmark this at the same time if you haven't already liked this video please make sure to like this video it gives me a lot of confidence and I'll come up with more and more awesome videos like these in the future so that's all about this video guys thank you so much guys for watching this video and I will see you next time [Music]
CuKsIVwZPXw,all right guys in our previous video we created this app so what i'll do at this point is i'll say python manage dot p by run server and it will start the server and in the mean time i'll show you my django playlist wherein i've showed you everything related to django so you guys must be accessing this playlist at this point if you haven't already accessed this playlist i want you guys to click here and make this playlist yours so what you can do is you can click here to bookmark it or click here to save it if you're watching on a mobile phone so what i'll do is i'll open this website and we created a dummy form where we can enter task title and task description okay so if you enter task title here task description here and submit you expect this app to actually write to the database and when you click on this tasks you expect this app to show the list of tasks what i'll do at this point is i'll say okay so when i come to home i see this home highlighted but when i come to this tasks i don't see the stars highlighted so what i'll do is i'll come to this task.html and i'll say don't make this one active but rather what you do is make this one active because this is something which is active when i come to task so home task it looks good at this point okay so when i come to home i'll update the title i'll enter some sort of description and i'll click submit and i'll then expect the app to enter some amount of information to the database okay so what i'll do is i'll come to my models.py and i'll simply create a model so inside the home app i'll say models.py i'll create a class i'll say class and let's stop here let's take a break here and install something which is called django extension and this is a beautiful extension you must have this extension if you haven't already downloaded it i want you to download it and enable it i'm enabling it and ideally you should be enabling it in your workspace i have now enabled it globally if you enable it globally it will be active in all your vs code projects which sometimes get annoying if you are working on javascript or say something else but if you are working on say only django projects then this is a very nice tool at your disposal okay so we have enabled this extension i'll come back to my models and i'll say task okay i'll say task and i'll import it from models dot model okay and you guys must be thinking how do i remember all these things the fact is you don't have to remember the things you can simply say django models and something will show up you can open this documentation you can open this page and you can simply copy paste believe me this will work you don't have to remember all the codes so since i've pasted it from um django website there is a high chance that there will be no syntax error so what i want to do is i want to say okay i need a task title and i need a task description and at the same time i also want a time okay so i want a time i want to store the time at which this task was last saved or the point when it was last created so whenever somebody created creator so whenever somebody creates a task i expect this time to be the current time stem so you can say models dot uh date time date time field and then you can say now auto now auto add now is equal to true okay so what this will do is whenever you create a new task your time will actually update to the time whenever the task is being created okay so i want this task description to be little longer than three 30 characters so i'll make it 300 characters and or rather let's make it text field so text field is something which can store greater amount of data so if you have some paragraph or something to store you can simply create a text field and if you want to have some limited number of characters to store you can use the scatter field but whatever you use both of these should work fine for simple apps okay so we created this model and we need to enable the app as well so you can come to your settings and you can simply uh add your app to install apps so what i'll do is i'll say home since i want to add this home app to my installed apps and at the same time what i want to do is i want to register my models because if i don't register this model i will not see this model in django admin and i don't want that so what i'll do is i'll come to my um admin dot py and i'll say from firstly what i'll do is i'll say from home dot models import or what was the name of my model it was task and then i'll say admin dot side dot register now you guys must be thinking hey how do you remember all the syntax the answer is i've been coding django since a very very long time and if you don't remember this index all you have to do is come here and you just have to type uh how to register or say register models in django that's about it and simply come here and you'll find something believe me you'll find something in the docs django docs are amazing okay coming back to this you can always refer to my code or you can always refer to these videos and what i'll do is i'll say task and my task model is already registered now okay i don't have to worry about anything else now i'll close this thing and at the same time i close settings or let me open keep the settings open what i'll do is i'll create a new tab and what i'll do is i'll say python manage dot py create super user i'll create a super user but it's a good idea to stop the server while you are creating super user or you are making migrations it's not a good idea to keep the server running so i'll create a super user first but i cannot create a super user because it's saying that hey you want to create a super user you haven't run the migrations yet and you are saying you want to create a super user so we need to say python manage dot py manage dot py make migrations [Applause] and python manage dot py migrate this will create all the tables that are required in the database make migrations will not create any tables in the database make migration will not touch your database but your python managed viewer migrate will create uh this thing tables in your database so i'm reading this it's showing me some sort of warnings it's saying that url namespace admin isn't unique you may not be able to reverse all urls in this namespace so it's showing me some sort of error and why is it telling me this i think i have used admin twice is it yes i have used it twice i need to remove this so what i'll do is i'll say python manage dot py migrate now and it's writing into the table whatever fields are required it's doing all the work i don't have to worry about this now what i'll do is i'll start my server but i need to create a super user right so let's come back to this command and i'll create a user called admin password is also admin it's not a good idea to keep your password this simple but since i am creating a video i think that will work and i'm not going to host this up with this password in the new near future and don't even expect me to do that because i'll not keep such a simple password i don't want to be hacked by you guys okay so having said that i've started my server and once i start my server i can reload this and let me go to the admin and let me see if things work so if i go to my django admin i can log in using admin admin okay okay so i can see this task and if i say this this is desc and let me try to create this task oh yes it works so it's saying that okay your task title and task desc works okay so you can edit it anytime you can come back to task and i don't like this task object i want to see the title here so as i told you in my previous videos you can simply create a function you can say str and don't forget to put a self here because we are inside a class and simply say return task title so self dot task title that's it and if you reload this now you'll see that this is being shown up the title of the task is being shown up now and this is what i want all right so far so good it looks good to me but what doesn't look good to me is this hello world so i'll change the title of my index.html and as you can see the extension has been changed to or rather the icon has been changed to django dj and you can also see this django admin here so you can simply change this to html if you want to use amit or if you want to do something which is html specific like formatting the html code and all those things but since we are working on django i'll keep this as django html and why this is helpful if you say load it will simply load static it will show you all the suggestions this is awesome this intellisense tool is awesome you can install this extension and you can enable this extension wherever you have django projects okay so i was about to change the title and i got distracted so what i'll do is i'll say to those list and what i'll do here is i'll say to do's list but i'll not say to do's list directly i'll say task to-do's list and here i'll say home [Applause] to-do's list okay so home task all right so if i reload this page i'll see the and title updated same time i'll see the title updated here now what i have to do is i have to create my task programmatically so when somebody comes to urls.py so what i'll do is or rather py i'll say okay whenever somebody is at home we want to show him this index.html but if he's submitting a post request i would expect something else to happen and what is that something else it is handling of the form which the user is submitting let me explain it to you when you come here when you come to this form you can see that there is no action here firstly i'll add action is equal to and i'll say slash and at the same time i'll say method is equal to post because i want to use a post request here and as you can see that i have this placeholder is equal to search i think i added this thing to wrong form i accidentally added it to this form so my bad i need to come here i need to come to the form where i have this thing so i'll say action is equal to slash and method is equal to post and i think we are good we can simply leave it like this and let me see what the name of this field is so i want to keep the name of this field as title and id is also title and name is also title and at the same time you can change the name of this one to desc and similarly name is equal to desc and id is equal to desc so i have the name i have the id and i have the label for this text area as desc now what i can do is i can come back to my form i can reload this page and whenever i type something whenever i type something and if i click submit you can see that it's saying csrf verification field csrf means cross site request forgery this protects you from attackers who might try to send post requests to your website and this is basically saying that hey we cannot verify whether this post request is coming from the same domain or not so we need a token we need a csrf token so this is kind of something which protects you from getting hacked you can take it this way at this point and if you don't understand what csrf is as a beginner i would suggest don't get too much into the nitty gritties of csrf it's totally fine at this point so simply all you have to do is you can simply type csrf and it will suggest you csrf token and once you click this this is the beauty of this extension which we installed by the way simply you click this and you get the csrf token now if you try to submit this form remember that we are not handling the form yet we haven't written the script for handling the form just yet so it will definitely throw us some sort of error it will tell us something and by no means it will write to this database so let me try to submit this form and see what happens nothing happens so so it's basically saying that okay let me submit this data to home and once it reaches this thing it's rendering the same thing so it's doing nothing so all i have to do now is i'll say if request dot method oops is equal to post i'll do something else i'll do something else i'll submit the form or write to the database whatever i want to do i can do inside this and if somebody comes to my home without this post which means that the person coming to my website is using get request then i'll simply say that okay take this html template and this is your website okay so basically what i'm saying is if somebody's submitting the form will do some sort of thing so let me write it down handle the form okay and if somebody is not coming to this website with the post request i'll simply render this okay so how do i handle this i'll simply say the title is equal to request dot form dot get or rather it's request dot post in django uh yes it's request dot post in django uh you can simply say title and at the same time desc would be the esc so if i save this and if i say okay print this for me title the esc so as you can see that this title and desc is being printed uh it's not yet printed it will be printed so if i submit the form you can see that it's being printed whatever i write so since it is printed we are ready to save these values into the database so at the top of my script what i'll do is i'll say from home.models import task okay and what i'll do is i'll say instance is equal to ins is equal to task which is a new task instance and i'll say title is equal to title and description is equal to description what's it called in my models dot view let me check okay it's called tax title and task desc so oops not here it should be here okay similarly task d esc so when we are using this task to create a new instance we need to supply these values from the model because these are the value corresponding to which this title and desc will be saved and don't forget to run this ins dot save now what i'll do is i'll tell my index.html that we have saved this thing okay so i'll say success is equal to true okay now you guys must be thinking what is the success is equal to true and let me do something here what i'll do is i'll create a python dictionary and i'll call it context because we can pass a dictionary to render and not a single variable we can pass a dictionary so i'll say the key is success and the value is true and at the same time what i'll do is i'll say context here and this success true will be given to my index.html and all i can do here is i can create an alert telling the person that your form has been saved and you are good so what i'll do is i'll say if i can write an if statement here and what i can do is i can say okay if this is true then we can simply show the user that okay your uh this thing has been saved to the database and you are good to go so let me do one thing here let me try to print success so i'll say success simply success nothing else so i'll say success is success okay so if i reload this page or rather click on home it's saying context reference before assignment okay so it's basically saying that you created the context only when the request dot method is post but you are saying that context success true when the request method is get you are saying that pass this to render so if request method is not post this thing will not be executed so it's basically saying that what is context in order to solve the problem what i'll do is i'll say okay by default the context is successful i'll say by default the context is successful and if at all the request method is post then we'll say okay now context is success true okay so if i reload this page success is false at this point so if i say this is a task title and something and i click submit and let me check if this appears here this is a test title okay and if i say let's learn django and if i say django is the best submit and if i come back to task let's learn django jango is the best this works okay i'm able to save my data to the database but but but whenever user comes to your website and he saves some title and description to the database he doesn't know whether this form has been saved or not he might think that what just happened did i accidentally reload the page or did they not submit the values that i entered so he should be given some sort of alert telling him that hey we guys acknowledge your message and it has been saved for the database so in order to do that what i'll do is i'll go to getbootstrap.com i'll go to the documentation i'll go to components i'll come to alerts and what i'll do is i'll use this dismissible alert this is the best alert in my opinion of course and then i'll come to index.html and i'll simply say hey if at all success is true if at all success is true show this to the user show this to the user or don't show this to the user okay so at this point what i'll do is i'll simply say [Applause] success and we will see whether it's true or false so what i'll do is form submit it and then i'll say true or false okay and then i'll say hello here and this is not the best way to do this i'll tell you what is the best way to do this but for now i just want to tell you that you can simply see the values there so if i show you this thing and if i click on home it's saying hello form submitted false i'll say submit this form and then say form is good submit it's saying hey hello form submitted true but this is not the way to talk to your users your users will be like hey what is this true and false what is this so this is not professional okay so we'll see what professionalism is in the next video we'll see how we can show users a better form of alert when we'll show them alerts only when the form is submitted so at this point what i'll do is i'll make it green and we'll then end this video and we'll come back in the next video and fix the things that are important so i'll say success so if you make it alert success the color will change to green okay so if you want to show this alert only when somebody submits a form you can use conditionals and this is going to be the topic of next video so at this point if you haven't liked this video please make sure to give me

KaJBkELJ5n0,all it gets in a previous video we saw how we can add these things to produce lists we added comments to reduce lists we saw how we can use Django template language and simplify Python manage toward py run server and once I fired this command my development server we get started and before we go to our to-do lists website I want you guys to access this Django play list if you haven't already done that I want you to bookmark this playlist and save this playlist this is going to be the place where I'll teach you entire Django you can see I have started it from the very beginning and we are gradually going deeper into the concepts ok so what I'll do now is I'll open this development server and you can see that I have this to-do list add a task headline and then once again I can add any tasks and once I submit it it tells me that sucks as your task has been added to the list and I can check this thing in Django admin that this has been added so let's learn Django add any task has been added but how can a user see the task if you go to our tasks page it is not complete at all so to start with what I'll do is I will simply create a simple table I will say ok serial number and tossed idle in then task description so let me come to this tasks template and I'll come to this table I'll say number then I'll say title then simply I'll say description or rather let me call it task title and task description I hope this is visible I'll simply move it down and I will collapse this as well and you can see task description I will remove this handle now what I'll do is I'll simply say ok so these were our table headings now what we'll do is we'll add some table data ok so let me remove all this dummy data from here ctrl s to save and we have one two three columns one of them is a rose so this th scope is equal to row will actually make it look something like this so it's basically saying that this is representing the end so what I'll do is I'll keep it as it is and what I'll do is I'll run a for loop let me write it here I'll say a run a for loop here and what I'll do is I'll say you run a for loop and it read through all the and it read through all deep tasks now where is your task we don't have all the tasks fetched from the database so we'll have to fetch all the tasks from the database so what I'll do is I'll say so this tasks this function will say that okay all tasks is equal to and I'll use this model which is tasks and say tasks god objects oops objects dot all this will fetch all the tasks from my task model okay so control SC I'll say context is equal to and say it's a dictionary and tasks is all tasks okay and I'll pass this context to my template serve contacts ctrl s to save now what I can do is I can reference this variable I can reference this tasks variable and it will contain all the tasks which is written by tasks don't object dot all so if I print all tasks let me show you if I print all tasks and if I run this thing if I reload this page you can see that I have all the tasks here so tasks they start this is a test idle so all these things are returned by Django in the form of a query set and you can use a for loop we treat this query set okay so if I say that for item inquiry set I get it trade through all these items let me show you I'll say for item in all tasks and I'll say print item not I think it was title let me check my model it was star slightly and then task DSC I'll say let me pray in task title now if I reload this page this function will get involved and you can see it's showing me the title for all of these task objects okay similarly what I can do is I can make it task de SC and if I hit this endpoint now I will see all the task descriptions being printed you can see all the task descriptions are being printed similarly I can use any of these model fields and I can print it inside my tasks function okay but this is not what I want I don't want to print my tasks I don't want to iterate through my tasks here what I actually want to do is I want to go to the template and show all the tasks there in order to do that I will run this for loop and say okay so far now this is the magic of this extension that we installed I am getting the suggestion if I click this I'll say tasks then I'll press tab and then for tasks in tasks once again I'll press tab key and it will automatically take the cursor to the desired position press ENTER once again and let me fix this I miss a spell task and what you can do is you can move this thing you can cut this and move it inside or you can use your alt key and down arrow key to move this you can use alt and down arrow key inside of Visual Studio code to move a line so if you want to move on line like this you can do that or if you're using some other text editor like brackets or sublime or anything else I'm totally fine with that I have no problems whatsoever with people using sublime text or any text editor of their choice okay but in place of Mark what I want to do is I want to say task dot I think it was stars title if I'm not wrong yes it was stars title and then I'll copy this thing and say in place of Auto I want to print task D ESC and I'll remove this third one okay so in place of serial number I'll say for loop dot counter now for loop dot counter will actually print the counter one two three four let me see how it looks so if I reload this page you can see that one two three four five six this counter is being displayed so I can have the number the serial number of the item being iterated inside the for loop here in order to refer this I just have to write for loop dot counter and then task title is here I can display it here and then task description is here so if I keep on adding my tasks it will keep on iterating the tasks variable and I'll see all my tasks on this page okay now one thing is bothering me a bit which is the padding above and below this so what I'll do is I'll come from a template I'll say hey class is Tech Center totally fine I want to add some padding here and it would be great if it's py three I need some space and I think this looks perfect at this point so here is the list of your tasks this doesn't look professional at all you can change this you can change this to all tasks or you can say to-do list altas so this is the place where you see all the tasks exelon Django add any tasks everything is being displayed here I think a wrap is almost complete now now there's a lot of revamp work that you can do and you can make it a whole lot beautiful you can add a lot of JavaScript on this page and you can simply say whenever somebody types this this can get filtered there are just endless possibilities to the amount of customization that you can bring it to this to-do list app but at this point I would like to tell you that this is almost complete let's see if we add a new task whether it gets showed in our tasks page or not so if I say this is the best title all somebody said this is the best title and also it is is the best description submit it tells me your task has been added to the list let me see if it's shoes of hair this is the worst title this is the best description it is being shown okay now there are a lot of variations of Tours list app you can simply create an actions button here and actions column and inside the column you can add and delete and update all sort of those actions and you can use JavaScript and view of the Django endpoints to delete this row or say update this row or there are a whole lot of things that you can do like searching and you can also do some sort of rearrangement or something like submit this form can be dragged to this location so there are a lot of things I mean to say that there are a lot of customization possible inside this app but the good news is that we have covered all the Django specific stuff that was required by to-do list in fact if not all most of the Django specific stuff has been covered so at this point if you haven't liked this video guys please like this video and at the same time if you haven't already accessed this playlist make sure to hit this bookmark button and bookmark this playlist and if you can save this playlist it would be great for you you'll have this playlist available and thank you so much guys for watching this video and I will see you next time [Music]
wN9ukxl0Z6A,🚨 Error: 'text'
gw-hKVt71A8,because in our previous videos we saw a lot of things regarding Django admin we customized Django admin interface we saw how static files work how to serve static files in this video we'll see how template inheritance works and why we should be using template inheritance in order to demonstrate template inheritance what I'll do is I'll first start my server Python managed or py run server honestly speaking guys I was thinking of demonstrating template inheritance using some other project but this is the best project to demonstrate template inheritance I'll tell you why firstly it has only four pages and it really gets very simple for me to explain you what name that inheritance is when the website is small so what I'll do is I'll tell you why we should be using template inheritance let us say you have this website and you are very happy with this website and start my server and show you how absolutely looks so my server is already started as you can see I am at home I can come to about projects contact me now let us say I want to add a new tab called hire me here if I want to add such kind of tab I'll have to add this tab inside contact me inside projects inside about inside home so I'll have to repeat myself four times but if you have ever heard of dry principal it says do not repeat yourself and when you are programming in django it is really important for you not to repeat yourself so how to get around this I'll tell you how you can get around adding the content in the four files separately so in order to get started with template inheritance what I'll do is I'll create a base dot HTML file and I want you guys to listen to me very very carefully because this is really very important so what I'll do is I'll create a based on HTML and this will be a base template which we'll use to extend all these four templates okay so our home or projects are about and of our contact dot HTML will be inheriting from this paste or HTML so what I'll do is I'll copy this home and I have entirely copied my home page so in order to create a template what I'll do is I'll say okay I need navbar all the pages do I need alert on all the pages yes I need alert on all the pages as well do I need this container filled on all the pages no this is specific to whom this content the slider and I'll show you what these me at-a-glance cards all these things are specific to home page so what I'll do is I'll exclude this and I'll even exclude this container but footer is something that I need and I wanted I want this footer to be shown in all the pages so if I want this footer to appear across all the pages what I'll do is I'll keep it here as well as I'll keep all this JavaScript and all this bootstrap CSS stuff alright guys so what I'll do now is I will say whatever I want to insert here should be called block body okay so I'm saying I'm defining a new block it's called body okay now what is a block I'll tell you what a block is I'm saying block body and then I'll say end block body so whenever I'm inheriting this template inside my home dot HTML I will say I want to extend from this template and I want to add some content to the block body okay if that makes sense so what I'll do is I'll say okay this thing is already there in my template I'll remove this then I'll say okay this thing is also already there in my template and in fact the navbar and alert are also there in my template so let me get rid of this and I need to have node static because I'm using static on this page so what I'll do is I'll keep just enough amount of HTML that I need to need to add to this place or HTML okay so what I'll do now is I'll say I want to extend I want to extend from base or HTML so I'll say extends this is Django template language so you need to have this index also extends base dot HTML and I'll say person and I'll complete the syntax now I'm extending from this paste or again let me keep this load starting at the top I'm using this load study because I have some static files which I'm using and this is required tag for that okay now I'm saying I'm extending from base dot HTML and I want to add the content which I am further writing inside my blog body okay so I'll say block body and I'll say and block body let me zoom it out and block body so if I show you my home page I'll show you my home page okay so it's telling me that there is some template syntax error it's saying extend notes be stored HTML must be a first template in the tag okay so it's saying you need to add this at the very top all right no problem so I'll add it at the very top and this works now okay so basically what i'm doing here is i'm saying that i have this based on HTML which contains required information to generate this home load HTML all i need to do is inject some content inside the body ok and what am i injecting i'm injecting this thing inside the body and the header and footer is common to all the pages all these home projects about in contact pages i hope you guys are clear with this similarly just like I changed my home dot HTML I'll go to my projects dot HTML and I'll use the same syntax I'll copy this and I'll remove this footer and I'll come to the top and I will remove this thing as well I'll paste it and I'm now saying that I need I don't need a nav bar I just want to start from the container because this is something that I want to add here inside this block body ok now I don't need starting on this page or do I know I don't and I'll come here copy this one come at the end and then peace this one control is to see once again and remove this footer control V and once again I'll copy this thing this extend send blog body and we add this here as well we move this this thing which is already present in my header and then once again I'll paste this here as well and you guys got the point what I'm doing here so simply paste this and then n block and blog body control V and once again if I save this and if I reload this page it works just as expected similarly for about as well and then for projects as well and then contact me as well now you guys must be seeing that I have this footer I think I forgot to remove the footer from my contact page yes I forgot to remove the footer let me remove the footer mm-hmm okay so you guys must be thinking how to get around this now in order to solve this what I'll do is I'll simply add some sort of content between this form and the footer or what I can do is I'll come to my be stored HTML and I can change this footer to have fixed bottom so I can save this and if I reload this it'll have fixed bottom so I can come to contact projects about and you can see that the space looks just fine so this is the end of our website I hope you guys understood what template inheritance is now if I'm only change the footer and say change the date or the year or whatever I want to I can simply come back to my base dot HTML and I can simply make some changes if I want to add another tab called hire me I'll add it to my base not HTML inside the navigation bar so if I say hire me and if I reload this page you can see that Jaime comes up here then about then projects some contact then hire me one thing that you can see is whenever I come to my contact me my home is being highlighted and if I come to projects then also my home is being highlighted so in order to solve this problem what I can do is I can add more blocks but at this point I don't want to add blocks because I want you guys to understand how this template inheritance is working even if you look at the title it's home on all the pages see even if I come to contact page this is showing home if I come to projects page this is showing a best home which is not what I want okay so what I'll do is I'll add another block but before that I'll give you a quick revision on how all these things work and and also remove this load static because I don't want it I have already added load static here if I'm not wrong yes I have so control is to save and then if I reload this this works so now I'll remove this hire me because I just wanted to show you that you can add as many list items as you want so I'll remove this Hayami this is not at all required what I'll do at this point as I'll explain you how this template inheritance works so you have a base template you have a template which you are using to inherit from your base template so you are saying that I want to use base or HTML use based on HTML but do one thing add this load static as well as add this content inside the block body so here I can see an empty block body what it'll do is it will take all this content and it will literally paste it inside this block body so if I have multiple blocks say if I have a block title so I can have another block called block title so I can have a block title like this and I can say end block title and block in fact an block title is not required you can even say an block but I prefer adding this title and block title because this makes it clear which block is ending there so what you can do is you can fill this title block as well you can say my title should be home here and then my title should be I'll make it one line of I think it'll look good you can keep it whatever way you feel like so I'll copy this all pieces here I'll say the title for the space should be projects kanessa save ctrl s to save and then once again well say about ctrl s to save once again i'll add this title inside my contact as well okay so if I reload this page here I'll come back here you can see that the title has been changed to contact similarly if I come to projects the title has been changed to projects about and we just have one more problem to solve which is if I come to about I want about to highlight it not home to highlight and in order to solve this problem what I'll do is I'll come back to my base dot HTML and I'll add a block called active so I'll say whenever home is active I want this thing to be active right whenever home is that if I want to add an active class to my li I'll say this will not be active the class name will be home active so home active means whether I want this home active to be active or not so whenever I want this home to highlight I'll set the value of home active as active okay and whenever I want about to highlight I'll set the value of about active as active I hope you're getting the point so I'll call it about that similarly I'll call this one projects active so projects active and similarly this one will be called contact active contact active and now what I'll do is I'll simply add active here so I'll say add an active class to home to this thing this Li home element and then once again I'll say that add this active to projects project active let me see if it's called project active or something else yes it's called project active so I need to change this as well copy oops copy paste copy paste copy paste so I'll copy this one and then I'll basted hair projects Octavius is a active candle SSA and then once again copy and I will come back to my contact I'll say active ctrl s to save ctrl s to save and then inside my about as well I have added this block active no I haven't done that I need to do that so I'll say if I want to add active to about I need to have this active here so if I reload this page and show you you can see that about this being highlighted now projects is being highlighted here and contact me is being highlighted here so this really gives a clean design to a website I hope you guys understood how I did all these things and also you guys like this video so if you like this website this project is almost complete let me know in the comment section below how you like this project and if you guys want me to do something else with this project please give some suggestions even if I switch to some other project I want you guys to drop some comments in the comment section below and tell me how this website can be further improved so I hope you guys like this video if you haven't already accessed my Chango playlist please make sure to access it you can click here to bookmark it and you can click here to save it that way this playlist will be all yours and I hope that this video was really helpful for you if it was please let me know in the comments below so you guys can see that I've added this alert to all the pages you can add the seller to some specific pages as well just using template inheritance and this is really an amazing concept in Django because you don't have to repeat yourself again and again so I hope you liked this video give me a thumbs up thank you so much guys for watching this video and I will see you next time [Music]
G-kdYhufgDo,because in our previous videos we saw a lot of things we covered the entire Django admin interface and it was amazing and we also saw how to customize the admin interface so you guys must now be thinking how to serve static files which is the point of this video so what I'll do is I'll show you why we should be using static files and what's the use of static files and then we'll take things forward from there so as you can see you are using the bootstrap framework we have been fetching all the files from a CDN CDN stands for content delivery network so all these files are being fetched from the network from the internet as you can see we are using the HTTP protocol and this is the server which is hosting the file and we are getting these files from that server what if we want to hold all these files on our server and serve these files from here in that case we need some files that we can publicly allow users to access in order to do that Django has a setting called static files di yards so what we do here is we create a static directory and it can be anywhere I am creating the static directory here outside my project root and as you can see this static directory hair can be used to serve static files so how does it work I want you guys to add a setting in your Django settings dot py which is obviously inside the project folder which is portfolio you can add something like static files dirs and in case you forget this thing you might not remember this thing in the future so you can simply search something like static files TI ours and you'll find this Django documentation and if you search static files file D yards so static files dir so there's no underscore so there's no point in remembering all these setting names because you have this Django documentation at your disposal anytime you have any doubt you can simply come to this dog in addition and you can get things done okay so having said that what I'll do now is I'll add the setting and what I'll do is I'll say okay so this is a list which contains the directory where Django will look for the static files so if you say I want to access slider one dot jpg so what it will do is it will look for slider wonder'd jpg inside starting so what I'll do is I'll say my slider one dot jpg is inside static so if somebody comes to your project wrote let me fire Python menu list or py runs server and once I do that I'll open my website and I'll say slash static slash slider one dot jpg and as you can see that I am now able to use the slash static slash slider one dot jpg so I am able to use this file because my static folder contains this file and I'm using this static folder here but it's always a good practice to append base dir now what does it mean to say that append base dir when I am in my local environment what I'm doing is my present working directory is this directory via static file is so if I refer to static folder what did he do is it will by default open this folder but if by any chance I go to some other directory anyhow I don't know how if I change the directory then this static folder will be looked into that directory and I'll get into troubles in order to make this path as absolute path what I'll do is I'll say base di yar and I'll add it using OS module so what I'll do is I'll say o s dot path dot join and I'll say join the path base dir and static what this will do is it will produce an absolute path instead of a relative path which was static so relative path is a folder inside the present directory and an absolute path is /c / something something something entire directory so you are giving the entire address in case of absolute hot but if you are giving a relative path you just referred to some folder and you say that from here you can refer to this folder so we want to make it as absolute path instead of a relative path so I hope that makes sense and that changes nothing obviously you see the slider one if you refresh this page but in order to be safe we do this okay so I hope you understood how to serve static files in Django now what we can do is we can simply come to our home dot HTML and we can change all the files that we want so instead of referring to this image from unsplash what we'll do is we'll change this path which was previously coming from unsplash to slash static and then slash slider one dot jpg so what I'm saying is I'm saying load this image from a static file from a static directory I'll copy this path and I'll simply paste this part to my IMG SRC is equal to this one which is the second slide of my carousal and similarly I change my third slide of the growl and obviously I'll add slider two and slider three so these are the images that I want to show so if I open my website once again if I copy this one and I paste this you can see that slider one is being loaded and then slider two is being loaded and then slider three image is being loaded so slider three is this Apple MacBook image if I change this to slider three you can see that this is the image which is kept inside my static directory okay now it is a good practice to add all these images to a common directory called IMG so let me create this common directory called IMG and I'll move all these images to my IMG so you can see that I have an IMG directory inside my static and I have these slider 1 to 3 inside that IMG directory so in order to make this work by the way this will not work now because I have to refer slash static slash I am the instead of slash static so I'll come here and reload it'll say image is not found so in order to make this work what I'll do is I'll change this to slash I am G slash and this page will start working so as you can see that this page starts working just like before and if I change this /img you can see that I can refer to the image inside the static folder and inside the static folder I have this IMG folder we'll chose my website sorry which was my image so as you guys can see that we can keep these static files inside a static folder we can also add a new folder called j/s so you can create a new folder called GS and we can keep all sort of JavaScript inside that folder make sure that you are creating the folder correctly you might mistakenly add this GS folder inside IMG so in order to check that you can open this in Explorer if you're on a Mac you can go to finder if you are on Windows you can just right click here if you are in Visual Studio code and you can click this reveal in file explorer and it opens an explorer window I'm not doing that at this point but you can always check the directory structure by going to the actual location from File Explorer I hope this is very clear to you and you were able to understand how to use static files in Jango alright so now you know how to use static folder how to use static endpoint and how to serve static files from Jango now you might be thinking that is it all the static files no I'll give you something I'll ask you a question and you tell me how to solve the problem let us say you have 1 million pages ok you have 1 million pages all see hundred thousand pages on your website and now all of a sudden your static file then it tree is changed or say you want to change it for some reason because of some URL structure or for some internal reasons you want to change it now you have two options first option is to change all the static references from all your templates to the new URL you cannot get around it you will have to do that but in order to solve this problem Jango gives you another method do the same problem let me explain you can use a load static template tag so if I write load static like this this is by the way Django template language so this has nothing to do with HTML and CSS at the top you can write something like load static and what it does is it loads static files for you now once you write this load static you can refer to your static files using static template tag I'll show you how so I am finding my slider image so you can say something like this you can say okay I want to refer to static and then space and the file that you want to access so let me keep it this way and then this is a Django template language by the way so static IMG / slider 1 dot jpg let me see if it works so let us check it so if I go to slider 1 dot jpg it definitely works so what we can do is instead of writing slash static / IMG slider 2 we can refer to this static tag and we are basically saying that wherever our static folder is and whatever our static URL is just pull this file just pull this file from a static folder that way even if you change the name of this folder or name of this static URL in the future this thing will automatically be handled by Django how cool is this so what I'll do now is I'll copy this and since this is the most recommended way of doing this I'll use this instead of writing slash static sly something but behind the hood this thing is also generating the same URL so you must be knowing all these things now what I'll do is control is to save and I'll reload this and I'll check the same for slider two as well it works fine it looks good to me so if I reload this page my website works just fine as you can see all the images are being loaded just like before so our developer website looks really very cool and I really like it I want to add a copyright icon here HTML copyright symbol and you can see it's ampersand copy in HTML so what you can do is you can add this footer 2022 and then all rights reserved let me see how it looks now we have around one two three four four pages in our website and there is only one place where we have this copyright footer I would love to see this copyright footer on all the pages but at this point I don't have it so isn't it a pain in the neck to copy this footer to entire web site to all the pages of the website about projects contact me it's definitely a hectic thing to do but I'll tell you in the upcoming videos a shortcut way to do this and an optimal way to do this when you have huge website how to manage this kind of thing so what I'll do right now is also copyright when you're going to all rights reserved I'll probably use a - this doesn't look good to me for some reason I'll simply use a - and I'll copy this footer I'll save this I'll copy this footer and I'll paste this put inside my about inside my projects and inside my contact me so where is my footer this is my footer and contact so what I'll do is I'll paste this right after my div container and let me see how this looks this is not looking as expected so in order to solve this problem what I'll do is I'll add position:absolute so I'll save position:absolute and there is a class called fixed bottom in bootstrap if you don't know which is there to solve this problem as you can see that my footer goes to the bottom once I add these classes similarly I can copy the same footer and I should be pasting the same footer inside my home and inside my projects as well so if I go to the bottom I'll paste footer I'll simply format document in order to make it look good then we have home contact about at the have not had a footer to about all have I know I have not I should be replacing this footer once I reload this page you can see that I have this footer so this is creating some problems here I don't know why let me see what the problem is so basically I have this iframe overflowing the page so this container is actually overflowing oh this is not looking good okay so I should be adding position:relative I'm sorry I've added it absolute relative control is to see now if you don't know what position absolute position relative is just bear with me at this point I don't want you to know a lot of things in such a short span of time ctrl V to paste and then once again inside the home as well I'll paste this and this should do it for all the pages so I have this footer I have this footer here as well and then I have this footer at the bottom here as well so just for quickly getting around this what I'll do is I'll add this position absolute position absolute to my to my projects and contact so if I go to my project so I'll add position absolute absolute and then once again to contact I can add position absolute absolute we can get around this thing by adding a min height to our body but let's solve it this way for the time being so we have this salt it looks good you can add some video description also if you want to change the aspect ratio of this video to boots drop video embed okay so if I say embeds let me see which class works good for me so if I add this four by three so if I say four by three let me change this to four by three where is my about it's here four by three okay so if I change this to four by three let me see how this looks and if I reload this page yes I am able to see everything at this point so as you can see that taken and aspect ratio of four by three and if I remove this class if I say just embed responsive and reload this it doesn't embed the video at all so I think I need to have this embed response a four by three class let me change it so sixteen by nine I think sixteen by nine will look just fine for this video so if I reload this page so sixteen by nine looks just fine and I think it's fine it looks good to me sixteen by nine you can change this text as required you can change it you can add some headings you can add some collapsibles whatever you want you can even add some sort of margin to to make it look little bit more compact but I leave that on you you can simply go to bootstrap documentation you can use all these utilities and components and that should do the trick for you so I guess this was it for this video I hope you guys liked this video this pretty much ends the portfolio website I think this looks pretty clean to me and you can make it more cleaner as for your requirements and has per your liking so obviously I added a video here you might as well add some sort of photos or you can add some designs some custom CSS JavaScript whatever you want to add and then you can add your projects here just like I have added and you can link these buttons to your project demos so that when somebody clicks on this click for demo they should be taken to your project demo so this website really looks good to me we have the contact form which works we have projects about home damn we started this with nothing and we are here so I want all of you to write congratulations in the comment section below that will make me really very happy if you do that and once again if you like this video please give me a thumbs up and if you haven't subscribed

iC7rc7LQFRc,gasps previous video was fun in that video we saw how to create models and how to create migrations and we also saw how we can connect our website to a database we saw how to connect our application to a sequel database sequel Lite database so you can see that the default database that I have selected here is sequel I'd in the future we will see how to change this database but for now let's stick the sequel Lite let's stick to what Django gives us by default alpha our Python managed dot py runs server and this will start a development server as you can see and I can visit this server and I can see my website as you can see it looks pretty clean it looks pretty good and I really love this image this image looks good so if you like any of the images you can simply right-click save the image and you can load the image from your image directory in order to show you how to do that what I'll do is I'll right-click save image as and what I'll do is I'll simply go to the place where I want to save it and I'm opening my project folder and inside this folder I'm creating another folder called static and I'm saving this file inside the static folder so I'll say slider 1 dot jpg so I've saved this file as slider 1 dot jpg I'll save this file as slider to dot jpg slider to dot jpg and if I find any other interesting picture what I'll do is I'll save that picture as slider 3 so let me save this one as slider 3 dot jpg now you guys must be thinking how to load this image from static folder so you must have seen that I created a static folder here and I saved all these images inside the static folder in my future videos I'll show you how to load these images but for now I'm just saving it because I like these so in this video I'll show you what is Django admin so we saw that this contact me works we saw that if we put something over here it simply submits it to the database and you can see that the data has been written to the DB but how do I confirm that the data has been written to the DB this is the biggest question and I'm going to be answering this question in this video so what I'll do right now is I'll go to my models and the name of Marlys contact if you look into this home app you'll see there is this admin dot py and that is this app store py now what I'm about to tell you might raise some confusion in your head but bear with me please what I'll do is I will register the model now you must be thinking what is this registering a model mean so registering a model means that I want to see this model in saud mind Chango admin now what is this chang wetland we look in just a moment but before that I want you guys to register the model in order to register the model you need to go to admin dot py and this is a step to see the models inside Django admin so all you have to do is you have to go your admin dot py and you have to say admin dot side dot and then register and then you have to write the name of the model that you want to register and contact is a model inside models file so I will say from home LOD models import contact okay so what I've done here is average it stirred this model registering a model means that I want to see this model inside Django admin so far so good what I'll do is you must be thinking what is Django admin we haven't even done anything we haven't even seen what Django admin is is it something that we are going to code this is the beauty of Django we don't have to code Chango admin in case of Django but rather what we do is we leverage the Django admin which comes with Django which automatically ships with Django so I advise you to stop the server at this point and fire python manage dart py and create super user what is this create super user create super user is what it says it creates a super user what is the super user if you have worked on Linux you must be knowing what a super user is super user has more power than regular users so in order to create a super user what I'll do is I'll simply say Python managed or py create super user and I'll say the username I want to choose is admin and I don't want to give an email address at this point and password is admin and password I am giving once again admin and it's warning me that he is is saying that hey Harry your password is really very common it's too short you might get hacked I'm saying okay let me get hacked yes I want to choose this password now I'm not going to use this password if I am in any production server I'm choosing this password because this is an app I'm showing you guys to teach Django and this is something that anyway I'm going to delete now we have created a super user called admin the password is admin what I'll do is I'll fire Python manage tour be my run server and I'm using my up and down arrow key to switch between these commands as you can see python managed not py run server and once I do that I can log into my Django admin where is Django admin in order to go to Django admin you have to open this one to 7.0 point oh point one slash admin remember this admin path we put inside our URL patterns inside the URL store py file this is to access this Django admin I didn't write this code Django administration this is not written by me this design is not written by me this is something that ships with Django and it is awesome so what I'll do is I'll enter username is admin and I'll add my password as admin and I'll press Enter key as you can see that I am logged in and I can see this interface this interface was never created by me but rather it ships with Django and this is the beauty of Django I just love Django because of this you can simply create a website and you automatically by default you have this back-end which is your Django admin situation and you can simply browse all the models all the entries everything that you have added as you can see that there is contact object one and this is something that I added this is something that I recently added let us add add another entry and see whether this works so you can go to this view site and this will take you to the site so let me open this side in a new tab and if i refresh this you can see that there are only two contact objects at this point I'll go to contact me and I'll simply say name is Harry and see Harry and Harry dot-com and phone number is 7 8 7 8 7 8 I'm just putting a random number please don't call this number and then what I'll do is I'll explain the concern I am testing Django admin and I am very happy to see that Django admin is awesome ok I'll submit this and if I reload this you can see that there is a new contact object 3 let me zoom this for you so that you can see this clearly contact object 3 means that this is a contact object this is an entry that I added through this form and this is the object which got saved here if you go to wheels what peeve I remember we saved this instance of contact I may also call it contact just for choosing a baton name sake ctrl s to save contact is equal to contact name is single name email is equal to email I don't want to install auto pepid at this point it's prompting me to install something your source code editor might prompt you to install certain things but at this point I'm not interested in anything all I want to do is focus on Django so contact is equal to this thing contact dot save I can simply add another entry and I'll simply say dj khaled another one submit and I'll go to contacts and you can see contact object for as you can see that name rohana true and website.com the email that i choose and this number that i chose and then DJ khaled another one I wrote this just randomly please don't focus on that now port fully website is almost complete I hope you understood what models are what registering models mean I just want to take a moment and tell you that if I don't register this model what will happen if I if I don't register this model and try to access my Django admin you can see that there is no contacts model so in order for that's model to appear here what I'll do is and register my contact model so now if I reload this page you can see contacts is here one more interesting thing that you might notice is that contact here was singular in my model start py but hell it made it plural plural why did you do that it did that because the objects inside model will be plural so if I say that I have a contact model that is singular but if I have a list of a lot of contact instances it will be plural so if the name of your model is fruit this will show fruits because if you click this link you'll see a lot of fruits similarly since the name of this model is contact and this contains a lot of contact so it's calling it contact so there's nothing much to it you must be thinking that why this contact model is showing up as s so if I name a contact s contacts it shows it as contacts and another s so it is not smart enough to detect the S so it will say contact s s so it'll append an extra s here and you should not have any problem with that I'm just telling you because you might think that why is my model name not showing up correctly it is actually showing up correctly it is the dashboard the inbuilt Django admin dashboard which is doing this for you alright guys so we have seen a lot of things we made a contact model work we created this form bootstrap looks nice everything looks nice the portfolio looks nice and hello visited I am looking for a full-time job you might also want to change the color of this thing to green only if you want to do that you can simply come to home dot about dot HTML and you can simply change this warning so yellow color in bootstrap is warning I think it was home dot HTML yes so you can change this morning to success so bootstrap calls green color as success it calls yellow color as warning and there are two more colors I think there are many more colors light is white dark is black and the primary is blue so you can see all these colors inside bootstrap documentation at this point I'll just reload this page and green looks cool to me because this should give positive vibes when I'm telling a visitor today please hire me I'm looking for a job so he should get some sort of positive vibes so in order to ensure that I'm just saying that okay let me color this as green okay so there are many more things that you can do you can add a footer you can simply go to get bootstrap comm oops you get bootstrap comm and this website hosts a lot of components I'd really love this website I can't tell you how much I love this website you can go to collapse carousal I've already used a causal by the way you can go to forms you get a whole bunch of beautiful components I really love this website I can't even express how much I love this website spin us spin us is something that I really love if you if you go to write HTML CSS in JavaScript for spin us no doubt you can do that but again quickly copying this and pasting it in getting a spinner is you know it really feels good and it saves a lot of time and efforts believe me so this was about Django admin in our future videos we'll see how to change this text because many people they come to me they tell me that hey I have a freelance client and I want to pretend that I have created this dashboard in order to show some work and they come to me and they say that hey Harry can you please tell me how to change this Django administration and once you log out let me log it out log in again they want to change this text as well they say that how to change this text how to change this text so I'll show you how to change this text and it's really very super easy to change the text you'll really appreciate Django admin after that now what I'll do is I'll simply enter my admin had been ignored this Harry which was prefilled inside this field because in my previous videos I have created some Django websites and in those videos I used that Harry username so you can ignore it I'll simply log in and I am logged in to my Chango admin - what it really looks awesome I have this model and contact contact I can simply add more contact instances using this form and it really looks amazing so I hope you guys liked this video and if you haven't already access this playlist please access this right now because I'm going to be add adding a lot of videos to this playlist and this playlist is going to be the place where I'm adding all the videos all the projects any advanced stuff on Django I'm I'm going to tell in the future will be added to this playlist so I think you should be accessing this playlist and bookmarking it at this point right now and also you can save this playlist by clicking here I hope you guys will give me a thumbs up please give me a thumbs up that way I come to know that you guys are liking this video you are liking this series I'm going to be adding a lot of projects in this particular course so make sure that you like this video thank you so much guys for watching this video and I will see you next time [Music]
nIMYRqwFpVM,"alright guys so in our previous videos we saw how to add our models to Django admin we saw what Django admin is how to log in how to create a user how to create a regular user you can actually create a regular user using Django admin so what I'll do now is fire this Python managed dot premarin server which will actually start the development server this development server is not fit for production I'm just adding this here because you might think that if you're going to some production server and you want to host your Django website you cannot do this at this point I'm emphasizing on this so much because you might go to some sort of web server and find this come on in the background this is not a good practice this way you cannot leverage the advantage of scalability with that said what I'll do is I will come to my google chrome and if you haven't already access this playlist I want you guys to access this playlist and click here to bookmark click here to save and also give me a like on this video so that I feel confident that you guys are actually liking the videos and I'm creating what I'll do is I'll simply go to 127.0.0.1 colon 8,000 acres can see this perfect looks really cool at this point we saw how to fill the contact form we also saw how to customize things and add bootstrap widgets and all those things I'll simply log in to admin I'm already logged in by the way so you can come to contacts and you can also add manual contacts here so if I say Harry manual I can say Harry manual add Gmail and then it it it it it it it it something ok now I can say this is a manually added feel okay and I'll click Save to save I can also add it a field I can simply say editing this and I can save so I hope you guys have already explored this but again I just want to show you some how-to if you want to edit it you can do that now this doesn't look good at all contact object 5 this actually doesn't tell me anything about the object how would be if it shows me something like Harry at this point added this contact object you guys know what I mean so in order to display Harry or say Harry manual in place of this contact object for or contact object five for that matter I can come back to my model and inside this model store py and more specifically inside this contact class I can add a dunder method call STR and all you have to do is simply add this method and you can say return self dot name self dot name will actually return the name of the contact object so if the name of this contact object is Harry it will show Harry so whatever you return here will be displayed here so if I reload this page it says that takes zero positional arguments but one was given there is some sort of issue with my STR okay I need to give itself my bad you need to add self here and if you reload this you can see that Harry Manuel named Harry or whatever the name is is being shown up in place of my contact object one contact object to and those kind of contact object three stuff I don't want those kind of ugly stuffs I want something meaningful here and I'm getting that something meaningful at this point you can also add email you can concatenate two strings you can simply say self plus self dot email if I do this and if I go to contacts you can say Harry Manuel and then the email ID so if you want to see something like this or I would also want to add a dash here whatever you return will be shown here so if this is something that tells you more about this object you can use this so you can use whatever you want let us say you have a lot of contact objects a lot of people are contacting you on your developer portfolio what is the most important information that you want to see you can simply say that I want to see the name of that person and the email ID of that person maybe somebody from Google is contacting you maybe somebody from Facebook is contacting you the demon ID will contain facebook.com/ so you can simply open your contact page where all the objects of contact class are being shown up and you can simply fire a control F and you can check if that anybody from Facebook contacted you you can say Facebook and this is just an example I just want to emphasize upon the fact that seeing contact object 1 2 3 4 is not good compared to seeing this you can customize this as per your needs as I told you so this is one customization that you can do to Django admin interface and if I come to my home once again I can add as many models as I born by registering them using admin dot site dot register if I register this model I'll simply see this model hit OK we'll see in a future videos some advanced customization of Django admin for now I just want to focus upon the basic customization another type of customization that I'm going to talk about is changing this Django administration and changing the heading which shows up when I log in so what I'll do is I'll come to my URL start py the projects you all dot py in my case this is portfolio so I'll double click this you all start py and what I'll do is I'll close all the other files because I don't want to open a lot of files here this is something that I recommend because once you start working with Django there are just a whole bunch of files which will get opened up you need to close all those files in order to have a very clean view of your project dashboard ok now what I'll do is I'll simply add some customizations here so I have already imported admin I'll say Django oops I'll say Django admin customization and to be more specific I'll say Django admin header customization and in order to do this kind of customization what I'll do is I'll add some text I'll say admin dot side dot header is equal to developer Harry okay I'll say admin dot site dot sight underscore title is equal to I'll say welcome to Harry's dashboard and then once again I'll say admin dot sight dot index underscore title I'll say welcome to this portal okay I'll show you where all these things are appearing what I'll do is I'll come to my admin and I'll reload it okay so once I reload this nothing happens I need to check why nothing happens I think I need to restart my server once I restart my server and I reload this you can see that my title shows welcome to Harry's dashboard why don't this change I don't know let me check if I have done any mistake okay so this needs to be sight and disco header and now you'll see developer Harry in place of this Django administration so if I reload you see developer Harry I might also say log into developer Harry okay and you can see welcome to Harry's - put in the title so whatever shows up here is the site title as you can see the site title is welcome to the Harry's - put the header is something which shows up here and once I log in I'll show you admin admin once I log in you'll see that this log in to developer Harry this thing is being hewn up here and you can see that welcome to this portal is being shown up here I think I have misspelled welcome em e kinda lets the save and if I reload this will change so it is very easy to change this log into the developer Harry welcome to this portal and the title and the heading text all those things it's super easy to change it you can customize it to your needs also you can change these model titles if you want you can add as many models as you want by clicking this add contact button and our website looks super cool you can open this view site in a new tab and my website there really looks awesome to me right now now you can go to get bootstrap calm at any point and you can pick up some components of your choice and add it to your website the best part about Django and bootstrap is that you can customize it as per your needs you can simply copy paste up from get bootstrap comm and it's simply free of cost you don't have to pay anything plus it's simple copy/paste and we all are PhDs and copy paste buttons and I'm just thinking of adding some good stuff a media object media object is this thing and you can copy this and you can add it below this me at a glance and what I'll do is I'll come to this home dot HTML I'll zoom out and I'll add another container maybe I'll say div dot container and I'll say that I want to add this media object inside this container now if I come back to my website and I reload you can see that this media object has been added you can use some image from your fun splash or from static folder we'll see how to load images and other media from static folder but for now I'll ignore this image you can simply add some image from one splash and you can further customize your website okay so I hope this video was helpful to you I'll simply remove this heading this media object and I just wanted to show you that you can add as many things as you want and I'll simply say footer and I'll say copyright all rights reserved okay and I'll say copyright 2022 all rights reserved I will load this and you'll see copyright when you go into all rights reserved I can add some sort of padding here and say py 3 and also I'll say P dot X Center just to Center the text and honestly speaking you need some sort of practice in order to get these things done as you can see I have very easily added this and I've sent our date and you guys might be thinking how did I do this so fast and I get a lot of comments people asking me how am I so efficient and fast with this and honestly speaking it's all practice I have treated a lot of websites I have spent a lot of time with Python and Django so it's really crystal clear for me and when I'm teaching you guys Django I keep these things in my mind and I understand I take a moment and understand that you guys are beginners and I need to take everyone add an optimal pace so what I'll do is P class is equal to Tech Center and I'll say background is say dark and I'll say it next next white I think it's not white it's light and you can refer to bootstraps documentation for colors I don't discourage that so a very beautiful dashboard add a footer here you can right click in stat in order to see what's going on so I can see that there is some spacing here I'll just see what the spacing is so the footer by default has some sort of margin I don't need any margin so what I can do is I can remove the margin from footer so okay so I need to add this BG darken text slide to footers so that it is the footer which gets darker and gets the padding so if I reload this page I think this looks pretty good this looks okay to me and you can introduce the padding if you want to you can simply say I don't need the padding you can simply say py one or two or something whatever feels good to you but this is about the customizations now you can see that it's not vertically aligned so what I'll do is I'll align it to the middle by adding padding to paragraph so if I add padding to paragraph instead of adding this padding to footer you can see that it creates some problem I'll increase this I'll say P by three and you can have a lot of iterations of it in trial and get this done so I can see that I need to add margin bottom zero so I will say my zero I don't need any margin for my paragraph and I think this is done we have a very beautiful vertically aligned footer you can add as many things as you wish to to the footer and you can also make some beautiful photo using some social media icons you can look into libraries or you can download the images from the internet and display them here spend some time and this will really look better if you spend more time for now I'm just having this footer which looks just basic just okay and also I can reduce this padding if you think this padding is too much so all the customizations are in your hand you can customize the website as you wish to simply copy this stuff from get bootstrap combatable you want to copy and simply you can add all the things that you want and your website will look amazing for sure so we have this projects page we have this home page we have this about page we have just contact me and if you see this website from the point of view of your first website in Django I think this is amazing this is truly amazing so tell me in the comment section below how you like this website do you think it is amazing this is actually very beautiful website because if you are creating this website as your first website just imagine after you create 10 to 20 websites how your websites will look like I mean just think about it so at this point you know what Django admin is you know how to create models you know how to save data to the database you know how to use unsplash api you know a lot of stuff and you already know a lot of Django at this point I recommend you to go and try out some other projects some of the static websites you can also freelance you can also go to freelancing websites and pick up some projects but make sure you can do them so there are many people hosting a lot of ads on these social media websites and these freelancing websites they ask people to get their static sites done and you can actually sign up to those freelancing websites and start cheap and once you start cheap and create websites you need two birds with one stone firstly you learn a lot of things secondly you will earn a lot of money but at this point don't run behind money you can simply brush up your skills by creating some sample projects and posting those projects to get up but you know a lot of things at this point so if you haven't already access this yet I want you guys to do that please access this playlist click here to bookmark click here to save this page should be all yours in the meantime you can talk me a comment and give me a like this really helps me a lot I want you guys to comment and give me a like give me a thumbs up that way I will know that you are liking the videos that I'm making thank you so much guys for watching this video and I will see you next time [Music]"
_CZ3J7J36kk,🚨 Error: 'text'
LQLg-Gvioes,in our previous videos we talked about what views are we created a very basic UN structure for a portfolio website in this video I'll talk about templates and templates is a very important concept in Django so you need to listen to this lecture very very carefully and I'll try to make it as friendly as possible so to start with what I'll do is I'll open my Django tutorial for beginners playlist and I want you to access this playlist as soon as possible because this is a place where I'll uploading all the videos so you should be accessing the playlist if you haven't already done that and you can bookmark it and you can save it by the time you see this playlist you will see a whole lot of videos already uploaded inside this playlist so what I'll do now is I'll see Python manage dot py the run server ok and this is a command that you can memorize because if you are working with Django and if you want to be a Django developer this is the command that you'll be firing all the time so what I'll do is I'll control it click this and you can see that this is my home page and if I could about this my about if I go to say contact I think I made a contact endpoint as well I'll go to my contact endpoint and you can create as many call endpoints as possible for this project I've created only for endpoints if I'm not wrong let me check it I've created it for endpoints inside my homes you all start py and the best part about Visual Studio code is that you can see home written here so you know that this you else not be wise coming from my home folder and I don't we get confused with the UL stood P when inside my portfolio folder so this is one of the best parts that I like a lot about Visual Studio code and that's why I've chosen it as source code editor another part that I like about Visual Studio code is that I can directly edit HTML templates there and I don't have to you know we use any other editor to edit the templates so it includes intelligence which is the suggestion of all the HTML tags it includes Emmet which is I'll show you what I'm it is when we create our HTML template as you can see that I have this home and I have this portfolio folder now portfolio is the name of our project and if I open this pod settings don't pee when side portfolio this contains all the project configuration okay I can edit all these variables called secret key debug allowed us all apps and all these bunch of things but at this point I'm interested in AB D IRS okay you can see that there is something called templates here and there is something called back-end dirs AB D ayahs there are a lot of things inside the settings store for you and you don't have to understand all these things in the very beginning ok so what I'll do is I'll tell you about the IRS so as we already talked about Django it is it follows MVD pattern ok so once we have this view start PIV returned HTTP response but this is not a website so if i go to source code of this website view page source you'll see you'll say what is this this is not even valid HTML you want to put some valid HTML in there and this by no means is a valid HTML file so what I'll do is I want this content to be coming from an HTML file and for that what I'll do is I'll return a template what do I mean by returning a template I have two options I can either write my entire HTML like this HTML head but just think about it if I do if I write all this HTML I'll show you some website give me a moment google.com and view page source view page source do you expect me to write all this inside this without any automatic suggestions or emmett ideally we can do that it's possible to do that but that might not be the best way to develop django website what i do is i will render a template and what I'll do is I'll comment this out and I'll rather include return the render now render is a function that is by default imported in our view store py if you have noticed a there from Django or shortcuts import render and insight render the first argument is a request now you might get confused why request here and y equals here but for now just bear with me right request here and here as well in all the views okay the next argument is the name of the template what I'll do is I'll say the name of my template is say home dot HTML where is this home good HTML we didn't see this home dot HTML and if I try to even open web site at this point I'll see the error in the error we clearly say that where is hope not HTML you talking about home load HTML where is it I don't find any home dot HTML so I'm very sorry I need to show this error to you what do you want to do is you want to go to your settings start for you I find this dirs and add a folder templates just add a folder you can add folder with any name believe me it can be anything I have named it templates because I think this is what it is so I have call it templates and I want to call it templates you can call it whatever you want but it's a good idea to call it templates so let's stick to that after I make a templates folder here what I'll do is I'll create home dot HTML and I'll use Emmet if you put an exclamation mark and enter it will give you this boilerplate and what I'll do is I'll write home and I'll say this is my home with HTML and I have messed things up here this is my home with HTML and if I load this at this point I will find that I have this is my home with HTML but there is something interesting happening here if i refresh this source page you'll find that there is HTML insider I am actually refreshing the contact source what I'll do is I'll go to view page source and you can see clearly that I have some HTML inside my page this is the ideal way to do this now I can change my home dot HTML and I'll see that everything is being reflected here this is the best way to do this and I can keep on changing this home dot HTML about dot HTML content dot HTML everything dot HTML whatever pages I have and I we come here and I can change and edit this template and I can see the change in reflected in my page so this sounds really very good so what I'll do at this point is I'll comment all of these HTTP response lines out and I will copy this one and I'll say I don't want to use this HTTP response anymore but rather what I'll do is I'll use this render and instead of rendering home dot HTML at all four places what I'll do is I'll render about dot HTML projects dot HTML and contact dot HTML so what i've done is i've saved this file and i need to have all these templates inside my templates directory so I already have home dot HTML and create my about dot HTML and I'll use Emmet I'll say about Allen to be typing really very fast at this point because I don't want to waste your time as if this is about I don't want to spend a lot of time in something which is not very concept driven so contact not HTML and what was the another one projects dot HTML so projects toward HTML so I have these four files I'll quickly use Amit and say this is my projects dot HTML and I'll say this is my about I already said that he'll use Emmet I'll say this is my contact contact dot HTML projects about contact home via all good I'll reload this page I'll go to about now about about about this is about contact this is my contact oops I I pulled this window out accidentally anyways so contact here and then projects so all the HTML pages are working very fine and if you check view page source by right-clicking you will find that it now contains HTML so what I can do now is I can simply type some gibberish and I see page not found if I say about slash gibberish once again it's telling me that this ul pattern is not matching with anything so you ought to type something which exists so if I say about I find this this is about this HTML template looks good but not as good as I want it to look like so what I'll do in the next video I'll tell you what bootstrap framework is we'll come back to these templates and we'll customize these templates based on our needs but before that I want you to understand one more concept so let me close all these templates and let me close all these you all-star team as well or I'll Park them aside now as you can see views dot P Y has this render request home dot HTML what if I want to pass some variable to home dot HTML is it possible yes it is possible so what I'll do is I'll pass a context to homegrown HTML and a context is named 'harry and I'll say course Chango okay so this is the context and this is simply a Python dictionary I don't think you will have any problem with this context is simply a Python dictionary nothing more than that what I'll do is I'll pass this python dictionary to my render as a third argument I'll save this once I save this I can use name and course as variables head so Django has something called Django template language DTL so I'll write here DTL can render variables from views ok and what I'll do is I'll wrap this up inside a heading and I'll say this is a video prom and I'll put these curly braces and what I'll do is I'll type how what does that let me see it was named and say okay name and once again what I'll do is I'll say this is a video from name and he will teach you I'll say let me put this here and I'll say P enter he will be teaching you and once again I'll put this double curly braces and what I'll do is I'll type Corsair so I'm typing the keys of this context dictionary now if I open my website you'll see that I have this is a video from Harry and he'll be teaching you Django where is this Harry coming from this is coming from the stationery I want you to pause for a moment and see how this is working I have passed a Python dictionary to home dot HTML and once I pass this python dictionary to home dot HTML this Python dictionary can be used like this here so inside double curly braces I can use the keys of the stationery and I'll find the corresponding value rendered inside my template okay so this is how it works we can even use for loops inside a template we can even use if conditions inside a template there are lot more things to this but this is the simplest way to render a variable inside our template so I want you to pause for a moment look into this and maybe pass another context stationary if I change my context stationery to something like this say name pawan and course Python if I reload this you can say he this is a video from Pawan he will be teaching you Python now I might as well change this he to name once again so it will look something like Pawan will be teaching you Python so this is a video from Pavan Pavan will be teaching you Python so this is how this was you can pass a context to your templates and your context will be rendered as you want inside your templates so I can put a double curly brackets it's actually braces so double curly braces and I can type the name of the variable inside double curly braces and you'll see that it is rendered like is inside your template so this was about template but there is more to this concept so at this point I want you to pause for a moment and try to create these templates just like I created these I want you to change the name of this folder and see if it works so if I change the name of this folder to template one template two and change the name of this folder as well template so on tablets 2 whatever the name of my this folder is I'll find no problems with my project whatsoever but it's always a good practice to name your folders and files very meaningfully if you give your folders and files a meaningful name you will understand what's going on and it's really important for you to do that so whatever project you are writing beta Java project beta JavaScript project media Python project we do machine learning project beta Django project you need to name your variables very very meaningfully so with that said we'll stop for this video and I want you to understand how these things are working we will not be using HTTP response very often in our further videos but we'll use render first argument to render is requests second argument is the name of the template and third argument is the context if at all we are passing any context and if we are not passing any context there will be no third argument I hope this is really very clear to you and I expect you to give me a like to this video if you enjoyed this video and if you're liking this course already please let me know that you liking this course because if you type a comment down below it really gives me a lot of confidence if you want me to drop in more videos and add more videos to this playlist I'll be very happy to see your comment and if you access this playlist and bookmark this it will be very convenient for you to follow my course with that said thank you so much you guys for watching this video and I will see you next time [Music]
ESky4QTOVZo,in a previous video we created this portfolio website negated some pages in this portfolio website and also we looked into the bootstrap framework now what I'll do is I'll open get bootstrap dot-com once again and after opening this get bootstrap com what I'll do is I'll further continue on developing my Django application so what I lose I'll say python many start py run server and it will start the development server and once I click this I will be able to see my Django app here ok so these are some of the pictures that you'll see and since I have only three images in my slider I'm seeing three images but if you have some more images in your slider maybe you will see some more images now I will tell you something maybe you might want to have an image slider which covers the entire width of the screen in that case what you can do is you can replace this container with container fluid so if I make it container fluid what will do is it will take the entire width of the page so as you can see it's taking the entire width of the page now and it kind of looks good so if you want to remove these margins and the margin at the top what you can do is you can say MT zero margin top zero and at the same time MX 0 so margin at left and right should also be zero so I think this doesn't work so inside the container I am saying MX zero I think this carousal is adding some sort of margin so I'll add this MX zero inside this carousal as well so what I am trying to tell my bootstrap is that I don't need this margin or padding whatever it is and let me see what it is I think this is some sort of padding so for padding you need to write px 0 so what I'll do is I'll say px 0 and I don't need any padding so what I'll do is I'll remove this free X 0 from here I'll just say margin top 0 for container fluid and px 0 for container fit so once I reload this page you can see that I see the expected screen here now you might want to add some of your developer projects here but the first thing that I'm going to do right now is I'm going to decrease the height of this image so what I'll do is I'll simply say instead of 700 give me 500 so I'd say 1900 into 500 so this will reduce the height of this image since I want little lesser heights on my images now what I'll do is I'll create another container since this container contains Mike arousal I'll create another container and inside that container I'll put all of the details so I'll say they've got container and I'll say it's to about me ctrl s to save and you know put something about yourself here so this is just a simple website which will contain some things about you or maybe you can say something like me in five me at a glance me at a glance so if somebody wants to have a quick glance at who you are as a developer they can see this portfolio website and you can add some content here before adding some content what I'll do is I'll say my three so I need some margin at the top and I added my three for that and me at a glance and I might as well add some sort of cards or some sort of jumbotron or whatever you like is appropriate we are not designing the websites here whatever we are trying to learn is Django so if you want to you know make some sort of designs which looks good you can look into HTML CSS JavaScript frameworks like bootstrap and you can master them and you can look into all these components spend some time on building designs see creating the design is one thing and implementing that design as an HTML CSS in JavaScript code is another thing so first you need to draw a design and then you might want to write the same design into HTML CSS and JavaScript code so what I'll do is I'll add three cards from here I will say okay give me a card I'll copy this and I'll simply paste this card inside my container I'll say div dot row let me tell you that row is a class inside bootstrap which helps you to keep things in a row now in place of this SRC what I'll do is I'll write something like so start unsplash.com and I'll choose the height and width accordingly so for this one I'll choose my height and width as 500 500 and let me see how this looks once I reload this you can see that me at a glance the height is little bit more so what I'll do is I'll reduce this I'll try to make it four of three and it crossed 500 let me see how this looks I think I need to change the other one so I need to make it 500 crossed 300 so in order to implement this I'll simply save this or I'll load this and I should be all set as you can see that I'm all set in got title and you can change the car title accordingly as well as you can change the entire website as per your liking but for now what I'll do is I'll simply add some me at a glance in 3 more cards I think that should be enough for now what I'll do is I'll simply copy this row or rather card inside the row and I'll add two more cards so if I replicate these cards I'll simply say ok I need two more cards and if I reload this page you can see that we have three cards here and you can write something whatever you want there and now in order to send to this what I'll do is I'll simply go to my code and I'll add a class inside the card I will say ok before I write card I'll say dev dot call m.d. and I'll say for now call md 4 as per the bootstraps grid system will contain three items by default if the row is of 12 greats now this might get a little bit confusing here so what I want you to do is if you don't know bootstrap simply copy/paste what I'm doing you don't have to remember all these classes bootstrap has a very nice documentation you can refer that documentation wherever you want but for now all you have to do is you need to wrap this card inside this call md4 class so we can quickly wrap our card inside call md4 and I will simply ctrl s to save then I'll say format document and my document is formatted in a very nice manner ctrl s to see once again if I reload this page you can see that these cards are rendered in a very beautiful manner now what I'll do is I'll simply Center this me at a glance because it doesn't look very good to me if I don't send to this so what I'll do is I'll go at the top and find this me and a glance I'll add a class called class is equal to I'll say take Center and this will centre align the text for me and I think this should be about it this should be all if you want to add some sort of my 3 it will add some margin if i refresh this this'll add some margin at the top you can even add some more if you want some more you can add some padding as well you can say PU y 3 and this will add some padding as well so if I reload this it'll have a lot of space around it in the y axis okay so I think this looks pretty good instead of card title and say designer and here I will say that I am a designer then I'll say developer then I'll say entertainer that I am an entertainer as well so if there are a lot of people working in your company and you want somebody to entertain all of us I can do that job so what I'm doing is I'm reloading the page right now and you can see that I have oh D is si si there's an interesting spelling of designer right turtle s to save and once I reload designer developer and 13 nerd not in 13 and 13 door and what I'll do I'll replace Python and I'll write Java and I think this is good if I reload this page now I'll see different images here and I think this method looks pretty cool now what I'll do now is I'll go to a bar and I'll copy paste the same thing because you know you can go to get bootstrap comm anytime and you can you can copy images of your choice so that's on you you can simply copy finish the components and you can design the website spend some more time and your website will look better far far better than mine through this video I want to focus more on Django concepts I can make this website even better but I don't want to do that at this point because I want to focus on Django concepts more whether it's said I'll simply go to about and I'll copy the same thing inside about because I know you can customize your About section as per your likings I'll copy this container I'll go to about and I'll add this container after nav so if you want to add some more components feel free to do that for now I'm adding me at a glance or here I'll simply say about me about me ctrl s to save and I'll go to projects you can mention all the projects that you have done you can use the same card for that I'll I'm simply using the cards that I've built for my project speech for my home page and for my about page well simply piece this card and instead of about me and say projects and instead of go somewhere and say demo I'll say click for demo so if you want to show some demo of your project you can say okay so you want to see the demo of my project click here and you'll see the demo so you can do something of this sort as well so since I'm writing click for demo here I need to write this here as well because it's not looking symmetrical I'll simply copy this click for demo and I'll replace go somewhere with click for demo ctrl V to paste I hope I did that correct once I reload you can see that my projects will show something like this so I'll say my project instead of projects so this is a very basic developer portfolio you can customize this portfolio using the bootstrap components you can go to Jumbotron you can add some sort of buttons button groups you can add some forms as per your likings you can also add some alerts for example if I want to add a dismissable alert like this one I'll copy this I'll say I'm looking for jobs or something like that assembly at home say after the navigation bar L say hey I'm looking for job can you hire me please something like that so if I paste this and say hello visitor I am looking for a job you can say something like this I am looking for a full-time job feel free to contact me if you're if you like my profile if you like my profile ok so once I save this and I go to home you can see that hello visitor I'm looking for a full-time job now I see this white strip here I can remove this white strip but before that I need to know that Y this Y strip is appearing here what is this white strip Mons ok so there is a margin bottom on my alert so I'll add a margin bottom zero inside my alert once I reload this this is gone so you can see hello visit I'm looking for a full time job feel free to contact me if you like my profile and your visitor might as well dismiss this notification if he doesn't like it so you can simply create this developer portfolio of yours about will contain something about me you can add some you can embed some YouTube videos I'll show you YouTube videos so you can embed some YouTube videos as well I'll show you an example so this is an example I guess I don't know why there is no example being shown for embedding YouTube videos so while some research on Google YouTube videos how to embed Plus bootstrap okay YouTube videos plus our remembered Plus bootstrap I hope I get something okay so we can use this one I think we can use this one I'll simply see inside about that okay this is a container and inside this container I'll say h1 dot or simply h1 I'll say my dance video if you are making something like developer portfolio you'll not add this dance video for sure but I'm just giving an example you can add some coding lecture my coding video my coding video and this is sixteen by nine you might as well choose some other aspect ratio like 21 by nine or four by three or one by one let me see four by three works better than sixteen by nine and simply save and reload the page let me reload the page I think it doesn't make much of a difference four by three and 16 by 9 is exactly the same thing four by three sixteen by nine twenty one minor let me try it 21 by nine twenty one nine control as to see and once I reload it changes okay so this looks pretty clean at least cleaner than it was before so my coding video and I might as well have something called class is equal to my four so I will have a class and a margin in the y-axis above and below my coding video okay so this will make it look little more better so this was just an example so if I was to make a coding profile I can say something like they say this is my coding video I can change the video ID I can go to programming with the Harry Channel and I can add my videos so what I'll do is I'll add my Django playlist I'll simply say this is my first video of Django copy link address I'll paste it and I'll just grab the video ID this is the video ID after we equal to and I'll paste it here so what I'll do is ups I will replace this video ID with mine and if I reload this you can see that my video is embedded here but there is a problem the problem is that there is some issue with the video it's it's overflowing the body I don't know why it's overflowing the body let me look into this one h1 dev iframe I don't know what's wrong with this I'll simply right-click I'll say inspect and let me see where this is mm their ID is equal to player okay so there is an iframe embedded here and I think it's seeking a lot of space so what I'll do here is I'll simply add some be ours or I can tackle the same thing using CSS in a better way as well but I'll just get around this by adding some P arts I think if I add some BS I'll have some space here or I can add some footer if I want so instead of be ours I can add some footer I'll say footer footer and I'll say copyright programming with Harry and I'll say all rights reserved okay so I'll reload this you can see copyright programming with Harry alright scissored I can add some class here I can say class is equal to Tech Center and they should bring it at the center of the page you might as well design it you can say X Center and next talk I think tech stock would make it black text light will make it white and PG dark will make it darker in backgrounds so this is how it looks when I add these classes I can also say py for it'll give it some padding and it will explain like this now this doesn't look like a very clean footer but again I just wanted to show you something so I just create this photo you can add some other photo of your choice or you can get rid of the footer altogether but what I'll do right now is I'll simply remove this py4 it doesn't look very good to me I'll save this and I'll reload and after the loading I think this should be fine and I'll say my three here as well my three so this will give some sort of margin at the y-axis and I might as well add some paragraph after the embed I can say lorem 34 and lorem 34 we'll add some dummy text inside my HTML code if I reload this this is about my video I can say something about my video this is a video that I created during this time and this this is a story of this video I hope you like this video and all that you can do all those things okay so this is about me page inside project speech I have three cards I just want to end this project as soon as possible because we are going to make some more exciting websites so I want to give you an exercise now I want you to change all of this code to make this website more exciting I think this already looks very clean this website is looking very good to me you can even right click inspect and see the mobile view and the mobile view will also look very good but once again this can get a lot lot better and I want you to make it better so your quiz and your exercise is that you have to make this website better and then what you have to do is you have to post your get up link in the comments below I'll look into all the projects I want you to do this and I know you will do this and I will check all the comments all the critic profiles that improve this project and I will have a look into your improved project okay so home about project and then we have this contact me we have this contact form and once somebody fills in this contact form we would expect Django to add this to the database but where is Django's database and what is the database we talked about sequel light we saw that setting star py contains something like CQ light what is that do we even need that where will the secret file be saved we saw that there is a file called DB dot C colon created here but what is the use of this file we'll look into all these questions in our upcoming videos and upcoming videos to answer all these questions so we'll create some models we'll create some database tables and we'll see how we can store the contact information inside those tables so if you haven't already accessed my playlist I want you guys to access

next time [Music]
46QEz7g9esc,in this video I'm going to be explaining you all the concepts of Django and we'll lay the pipeline of the first website that we'll build using Django so what I want you to do at this point is access my Django playlist if you haven't already you can click here to bookmark it and you can click here to save it I am saying this again and again because I get a lot of comments in my videos that you haven't started the course from the beginning so I actually have started the course from the beginning and there is a course playlist and the link is in the description so I want everyone to access the playlist as soon as possible now what I'll do is I'll move on to Visual Studio code and what I'll do is I'll create a new project after creating a new project what I'll do is I'll lay the UL store py file I'll tell you what will be the end points of a portfolio website so let's go to the folder where we'll be creating our first django app now as you can see that I already have a pwh tutorials django app already here what I'll do is I'll press shift in my Windows machine and I'll click I'll actually right-click and then I'll say open partial window here now what I can do is I can save Django admin and if I just say Django admin it'll tell me all the commands that I can run along with this now what I'll do is I'll say Django admin start app and then I'll say sorry start project not start app so I want to use this one start project I'll start a new project and I will call my project portfolio this will be my develop a portfolio which will host all the details of the project that I've built so far and you can use this template as well you can use this django application and you can showcase your skills so what I'll do is I'll press Enter key and as you can see that I already have this portfolio folder created now inside this portfolio folder I have another portfolio folder which contains the configuration of my Django application managed or py is my Python utility which I'll be using to you know give some commands like start app or run server make migrations we'll see what migrations are but for now I want you to shift or click open with code and you'll see that this folder will be open in Visual Studio code what I'll do is I'll close my pwace tutorials folder and I'll maximize this one and what I'll do is I'll open a new terminal once I open my terminal I can see that I can type Python manage dot P why start up here and again pretty much add any kind of command I can execute it and I can run and produce the same result that I would have produced using the terminal so this is the integrated terminal inside Visual Studio code and it is really very helpful and I use it very very often now what I'll do is also python managed not preview I start at home just like my previous project and create an app called home now you know what home is now you know what project is you know that portfolio contains the project configuration files like setting start Pui a sty dot P Y which will not worry about much you all start Bui WSU I wrote py and manager py is actually outside the directory so if I collapse this directory you'll see that managed or py is actually outside these poor directories if I open my home I don't see a URL stored py because that is something that we'll have to manually create so I'll create you all start py and I'll add some code inside this file in just a moment now you can see that there is admin dot Bui app store py models not Bui tests or P wine all this side of might seem of a whole lot overwhelming at this point but of what I want you to do is pause for a moment and just listen to me what I'm saying because if you listen to me you get what exactly is required you don't have to know all these files and you don't have to remember all the commands you just have to know just enough to build your portfolio application so whenever I create a new Django application what I do is I just fire Python managed or py a run server and once I do that my server starts and if I click this you can see that the installed successfully congratulations now why did I do this I just wanted to check whether everything is working fine or not and things are working pretty good so what I'll do is I'll go back to my Visual Studio code and what I'll do is I'll go to my projects URL start pure project is portfolio remember that and if I open projects you also don't be why I see this code now you might have noticed what is this admin I'll talk about admin very soon you just ignore admin for now and add some more paths to the URL pattern in order to add more paths to URL pattern what I'll do is I'll say whoever comes to you with a request all you have to do is give that request to home dot URLs give that rigorous to home dot Ewell's in order to say this what I'll do is I'll copy this and say ok whenever somebody comes with a request you do nothing and hand over the request to home's URL dot P Y so home good URLs but I haven't imported this include so I need to do this and include is inside Django dot you Arliss this is something you'll have to remember or you can simply you know refer to this template it's very straightforward now you can see that I have this portfolio and I have this blank inside path and I'm saying include home dot URLs now I will save this file and what I'll do is I will add some URLs inside my homes you all taught me why what I'll do is I'll copy this as is and I'll paste it here and what I'll do is and say from and then I'll say I think I need to stop my server because I'm still in a process to write my code what I'll do is I'll say from home dot from home import views so I am imported views from home so this is my home directory and what I'm importing is this file used wot py inside my home now what I'll do is I'll say ok we have imported homes views now what I'll do is I'll say ok if somebody comes with a slash you have to redirect him to home dot views dot index function let us so what'd I lose I create an index function here I'll say def index and you have to write requests like this and then you have to return HTTP response this is something that you'll have to remember a bit that you need to import HTTP response from Jane Goodall shortcuts and you need to create a function with the request as a default argument and then you have to return HTTP response this is my home page and in bracket and say slash that is this is something that I want to display once somebody comes to slash so if my website is programming with our e.com so whenever somebody comes to programming with a recom this is the text that he'll be saying okay I hope this is very clear to you what I'll do now is I'll say okay if somebody comes with a slash you need to take him to the function inside views which is called index so in order to do this he'll use this code in fact comment which these people have given I'll use this comment and I'll copy this one I'll say okay so the second argument you are using is used at home and name is equal to home and copy this and I'll paste this hair all say okay if somebody comes to home I'm redirecting him to home views so I'll call it home instead of index even call it anything you want honestly you can call it anything you want you can call it index you can call it home you can call it SLES such slash you can call it Haddie you can call it Christopher you can call it John you can call it to whatever you want so what I'll do now is I'll save this file and what I'll do is I'll start my server in fact if I haven't told you already whenever you make a change inside any of these files your server will reload automatically and this is the beauty of Django I'll show you so if I press ENTER and I control is to save you see that it's reloading it says that ok I see you have made some change let me reload to reflect that change inside your browser and inside your project so what I'll do is I'll press ctrl s and I'll go back to my previous configuration of this space and what I'll do is I'll come to my browser and if I reload this now you can see that it's saying that oh you have to Edmunds and you have a slash what is going on let me see let me debug it so whenever I type 1 2 7 @ 0.0 0.0 0.1 : 8000 this request will be redirected to my projects URL start py it will say ok if something comes to you all you have to do is you have to include a home god URLs so it will say ok something came to me let me go to home got URLs then it is saying that does it matches admin no does it match / no it doesn't match / it is a blank so I'll say ok if it is a blank all you have to do is you have to simply show me this is my home page so the way you are putting slashes here might also create trouble and if you are having problem as a beginner adding slashes and you are thinking where to add slash and we are not to add slash I would strongly suggest you create this project with me and host it to your github account or maybe host it to your email and whatever wherever you want you can keep it into your hard drive as well and once you have this project at your disposal what you'll do is you'll have something to look into and you will find out ok so I added a slash here but I didn't add it a slash here so what you want to do is you want to not add a slash here and add a slash here whatever you want to do I mean you need to be knowing where to add slash and where not to add slash ok so this might be confusing at first and even I as an experienced Django developer get confused with this so there are things which will confuse you but there are things that will make your life easier for instance if you have your code inside your key table account that'll make your life a lot easier coming back to this URL conf I have this admin header and I am repeating this admin here I should not be repeating it here all I want to handle here in homes you all start py is my name is equal to home views dot home whenever somebody comes with a blank slash I want to redirect him to home that's about it I don't want to handle slash admin slash admin no I don't want to handle admin more than once admin in most of the cases will be there in your projects you won't store py only and it will not go beyond there so what I've done right here is I am redirected in my part to Holmes URL stored py now I can modify my holes you all stored py and I can make changes to my Holmes you all stored py in order to add some more endpoints I want to add an amount endpoint so I'll say comma I'll press control D or whatever your shortcut for replicating a line is you can even copy this line and paste it below that and I'll say okay I want to make it about name about I'll save it once again I'll say okay I want to create a contact end point I will say contact and then I also want to create a project endpoint and if you're typing name is equal to project here you need to have it here as well so I want to create my function with the name of about inside view store py I'll create it in just a minute so just give me a moment I've saved this file and at the same time my server is reloading as you can see so if I scroll down it is saying that hey Harry listen to me you were saying that whenever somebody comes with a path slash do you direct him to home but you are saying it when it when somebody comes with a blank redirect him to about why are you saying that when somebody comes with a blank or with a slash take him to home and you will at the same time saying that take him to about so this is long I need to say about here and I need to say slash project set and let me call it project as Mel projects as well because I want to keep things consistent once again I'll say contact and my view start contact will be a function and my name is equal to contact is the name of this end point now you can see that it's saying that okay that's good things look good so far but when I ping will do your views or py I did not find about I did not find projects I did not find contact what's going on why don't you create these functions so I'll say okay sorry and you to create these functions so what I'll do is I'll say okay let me press control D to keep things fast so I have configured my shortcuts in Visual Studio code so control D is one of them and I have configured it by going to this Settings button and then keyboard shortcuts and then you can you know use all these settings to change your keyboard shortcuts so I'll close it for now and what I'll do is I'll save my you I will start py and inside vo I'll create an about function I'll say this is my about page and Elsa / about this is my what does that projects if I'm not wrong yeah if as projects so okay this is my projects this is my projects page slash projects and this is my contact page slash contact and once I do that I'll show you that my errors will go away let me paste it here ctrl s to save and I expect all my errors to go now okay so it's saying that your your server has been started and we don't have any problem now so we can go back to our app and we can test these endpoints let me put some gibberish first to show you that if I put some gibberish it will start complaining about the URLs not having this particular endpoint now what I'll do is I'll say okay I want to go to say slash so it'll say this is my homepage now if I say slash about it'll say okay so it's saying that about is not found let me see what the problem is okay so if I say about I don't have to include this slash so as I told you already that I also get confused with this slash at times so what I'll do is I'll remove this slash and if I reload you can see that it's saying this is my about page and if I go to projects it'll say this is my project page Road chats and I'm here this is my projects page and what I'll do is I'll peace contact here and you can have as many pages as you want if I write something else here like if I say Maps we haven't defined maps so it will throw error naturally okay so this is how a django website is laid this is our portfolio website is laid home will be the home page about will tell something about us projects will tell our project said we have built and contact will be finally a page where people can come and they can contact us so this is a portfolio website that we are gonna build and believe me to look very beautiful in the future so all you have to do is have some patience hang on I'll make it as beautiful as possible and again I'll tell you how to make it more beautiful so that you can further customize your website and make it as awesome as you guys are okay so for now what I want you to do is access this playlist bookmark this playlist and just for me like this video and subscribe to this channel if you haven't already done that that would be a lot for me so I just want to request you to subscribe to this channel and like to this video and at the same time access this playlist if you haven't already done that so that's about it for this video thank you so much guys for watching this video in the further videos what I'll do is I will tell you what bootstrap is we'll use bootstrap we'll make things awesome thank you so much you guys for watching this video and I will see you next time [Music]
eBBmnbYontM,welcome back guys in our previous videos I told you what apps and projects in Django are and I also told you the difference between the two what you are patents are and how an incoming request into the Django framework is interpreted and how of the you is generated out of that so in this video what I'm going to be explaining you is the Django's MVT architecture you might be thinking that I'm teaching a lot of theory in this course but hang on for a while this is the only part which includes a lot of theory in the future and upcoming videos what I'm going to be doing is will create a lot of projects will write a lot of code will understand how Django code works we'll see a lot of examples so you don't have to worry about a lot of theory but for now I want you to understand the basics of Django and it's just the apps projects and how MVD architecture works that is the theory part in Django the rest everything can be done by coding and by understanding the theory and after you understand this little bit of theory I'm telling you that it'll be very easy for you to develop Django applications before we proceed to the MVD architecture I want you guys to access this playlist if you haven't already done that I want you to click here and access this playlist bookmark it and click here and save it so that you have my course at your disposal now I'll explain you about the Django's MVD pattern firstly what is this MVD pattern and why do we bother about this every T is a design pattern that Django uses and we are bothered about this because this is the pattern that Django uses and we have to understand it before we created Django application so talking about MVT it is a design pattern it's a software design pattern so you know what MBD is it is a way how files are structured how things work in Django and we'll see what MVD is in just a moment now it is a design pattern used by Django as I already told you em V and T in Django stands for Model View and template so you know what it stands for then you might be thinking you told me about the URL patterns now you are saying MVT how both of these things are linked with each other I told you that we have something called URL patterns in Django you are Gardens and I told you that whenever you send a request to Jango for instance if you say programming with Hari calm slash about what happens is it checks for any pattern that matches slash about if it matches it will show the corresponding view if it doesn't matches it will show you and standard 404 error or whatever you have configured in your Chango application now if we have something called about slash me then you'll see there are two things that Django needs to match one in slash about and the other thing is me so what happens is the URL patterns check for slash about and then it will check for slash me and if something matches then it will say okay now what I'll do is I'll show the corresponding view with which your URL pattern is matching so this is how you up a turns work but overall what Django has to do is it has to take in your request so if I talk about django django has to take an incoming request so I'll call it request and once it takes your request it has to return a response what happens internally if I talk from code standpoint it is the architecture it is the software design pattern that I'm talking about the way Django produces response out of requests highly depends upon the software design pattern that we are using and in this case it is MVD so whatever happens inside Django so this is the area that we are going to be zooming in and we'll understand how this works so how a response is interpreted sorry how a request is interpreted into a response so request looks something like pwh dot-com slash about slash me and response looks something like HTML CSS and JavaScript so this is a response it might contain some images inside HTML it might contain some style sheets or JavaScript scripts so all these things are linked inside the HTML so this is what response contains in journal you might have JSON response as well you might have XML response as well but in journal it's going to be HTML so what I'll do now is I'll explain you how Django works internally when we talk about Django from code standpoint so what I'll do is I'll tell you how everyda pattern works so let us say you are a user so let us say this is Harry and I am a user I have a browser inside my computer installed and I don't care how you have build your application what I know is I know that you have given me a URL which is programming with Harry calm slash say blog slash Django one let us say this is a URL you have given me and you have told me that this is my first django text tutorial go and visit my website and read it so you are not bothered about what my blog is by using whether it's by using PHP whether it's producing some static web pages whether it's producing django flask whatever all you know is that you have to enter this URL in your browser window and once you press enter you expect a response now once you send it to the server so this is user and then I'll tell you something I'm creating a line here so this is the user and this is the web server user might be in India and server might be in say United States or server might be in United Kingdom it might be in India as well it will be in a different location mumu in most of the cases from the user okay so what user will do is user will say I want to request pwh dot-com slash blog slash Jenga once please give it to me now once user does this what happens is Django will receive this blog slash Django one because pwh dot-com points to my Django website so it will receive this blog slash Django one it will give it to you early dispatcher it will say hey you are dispatcher can you do me a favor can you see what response are we supposed to send back to the user corresponding to this request the request is blog slash Chang 1ul dispatcher will say alright Django let me do this let me look into this and don't worry I'll do it for you now what happens is you only dispatcher will look into the URL stored py and it will find a corresponding view which is matching the given request so let us say I have a view called home or say I have a view called Django one this view might talk to a model which contains the data so model is nothing but database let me write it first people it is nothing but a database table counterpart in Django so model is a Python class it is nothing but a Python class which is linked to what database table we'll see how this works what we do is we just create a model and when I say that we create a model we create some piece of information about our tables and we can give Django command that hey this is the model could you please create a table in a database and Shengo will say alright I'll do that for you now this view at the same time might talk to a template directory from where it fetches it's all sort of templates for example if I have a blog and I have some heading I might have a template like this I'll say heading here I'll say whatever I put in here should be replaced by heading and content here and the rest of the websites images navigation bar and everything will look similar for all the pages so this is a template which you can use as a base and you can inject some sort of information inside this template to produce unique but very similar pages so my Django tutorial one will have some other heading in content and my Django tutorial too might have some other heading in content but if you look at both of these pages you will see that they are very very similar to each other so this is how template works and we'll see template in code you don't have to way much about that at this point all you have to know at this point is that URL dispatchers will resolve to a you and this view can dynamically talk to some model which is nothing but a database table and at the same time it can talk to some template so what it will do is it will fetch some data from the database say it will fetch the heading and content it will say ok the heading is Django introduction and content might look something like Django is a popular Python popular by the framework and something something something something and with these pieces of information you can say template please render this with the information that I'm providing you so template will be provided by the heading and the content and what template will do is it will finally return a template or filled in template a template that has been filled in with information two views dot B Y and this views dot py will finally return the response back to the user it will say ok I have generated the response here is your response enjoy a response so this is the response that this fuse dot py will give back to the user why is this pattern called mvd architecture this pattern is called MVD architecture because we have models which is nothing but database tables it is actually a Python class which corresponds to a database table and we also have a template here so model M for model v from UT for template it's called MVC architecture we have another design pattern as well uu which is called MVC pattern MVC pattern and it stands for Model View controller controller honestly speaking you don't even have to know about all these things in order to get started with Django but I am telling you all these things because this is how Django works and this is all the theory that you need to learn to get started with Django once you get started with Django you will know what model is will you'll know what bu is you'll know what template is I already told you about you dispatcher we'll go and do some exercises on that and probably that will also be crystal clear to you but still I'm telling you all this because you know once you create a website and you don't know what is happening that is the worst thing that can happen to a developer I as a teacher want to tell you each and everything about Jango how it works and finally when you are an awesome Jango developer and you look back at things you'll think that oh yes this is the thing that I knew from starting and when people start talking to you about MVC MVT you will actually know what they're talking about so even if you haven't understood this entirely you don't have to worry proceed to the next videos we'll do some demos and after I do that demo you will understand what this model view and template is but before I end this video what I'll do is I'll go to my visual studio code and I'll show you how all these things work in code will not be building any websites there in this video but what I'll do is I'll show you where is a view where is a model and where is a template and how all these things work I'll point to these files and I'll show you how these things work in action so let's go to a visual studio code and they will see how these things work in action all right guys so I am inside my visual studio code and this is the django website that we created now this website might not do much but I use this as a template to show you how you are the patterns work so what I'll do is I'll fire Python manage dot py run server and after I fire this you will see that my server is started I'll control click and once I control click I'll see that my server has been started so as you can see when I enter this spot it tells me that hey slash doesn't matches with anything so I'm sorry you got to be adding this slash admin or slash Harry so what I'll do is I'll say ok slash Harry and when I say slash Harry tells me that it doesn't matches anything when we went inside what Hell resolves to we found some errors so when I type slash Harry it said ok we'll see what's there in home dot URLs and will further match the patterns from here inside home got URLs so when I opened my home dot u all's I see boy there and I see parts there but since you see neither of these things inside my URL patterns my django URL pattern will expect something called boy or something called putz in order to return a response obviously so if you give it to something like this it'll say I'm very sorry but this thing doesn't matches with anything your URL patterns doesn't contain something like / share / this gibberish so it returns this error to me now it's telling me that page not found now if you're debug mode is off in your production environment it'll definitely not show you this thing not sure what kind of us you have so you might be thinking why is it revealing my information here why is it revealing information to my user it is not revealing information to your user it's actually telling this to you so this is the page which is displayed only when you have debug is equal to true if you have debug is equal to false Jango will display a standard photon for page you can read this message you are seeing this error because you have debug is equal to true in your Jango settings change that to false and Jango will display a standard for not for page so this is what we talked about URL patterns in our previous videos but what is MBT this model right here that you see you'll not see this model store py file inside the project directory why is that so because models is something that you will find inside the apps project contains the information about the project configuration in general it doesn't do anything what actually does something is your app so your app will contain model stored py and you start py and all that good stuff so once a URL is the result to a view it will land to a function some sort of function inside view start py let us say that function happens to be parts one side passed let us say this is a function with displays displays parse off all the blog posts inside the chain go website let us say this is what it does I'm just assuming this I'm not creating a website which will do this let us say paths is a view which will show the list of all the paths inside a given block I'm just making this up now what I might want to do is I'll say fetch all these slugs from the slug table or blogposts table or whatever the table name is so what I'll do is I'll talk to a model so if you remember my diagram that I showed you views will talk to models and views will talk to template as well so views will talk to both of these things views will talk to models and views will talk to template as well so this is how it will talk to models so we'll write some code here which will fetch the data from the models now once the data has been fetched what I'll do is I'll create a context dictionary my context dictionary will contain something called say heading and I'll say this or Chamber tutorial 1 and it might also contain the content so I'll say ok the content looks something like this I'll say content X this is the first Django tutorial on this my keyboard will break enter your planet ok I'll save this and since I've prepared this context what I'll do is I'll use a render function and I'll send this context to my template I'm not creating any website here I'm just telling you how your views will talk to your templates so once it talks to the template your template will be creating a new page all together which will contain the body of the template but actually the content that I am passing through the context so it will contain the heading as Django tutorial 1 and it will contain the content as this is the best Django tutorial on this entire planet so this is how this works so views are talking to models and the views are talking to templates as well in order to generate an HTTP response so finally what happens is I'm rendering a template and sending it back to the user that's how the entire MVT architecture works I hope you have understood all what I have told you in this video or what I've tried to tell you in this video because we are going to be seeing a lot of examples I'm not going to leave this hair we'll build a lot of websites so a lot of projects are coming up you don't have to worry about anything right now or whatever you have understood so far so good because we'll see a lot of examples from here we'll build a portfolio website we'll do a lot of things so if you haven't already subscribed to my channel I've seen mine analytics actually there are many people who are watching these videos without subscribing to the channel I request all those viewers to please subscribe to this channel because I'm providing the entire course for free also if you haven't already liked this video make sure to like this video now I'll show you what we'll build in our upcoming videos before I show you what we'll build in our upcoming videos I want you to bookmark this playlist and save it at the same time alright then so this is the website that we'll build I'm not showing you anything I just want to tell you that a portfolio website is something that I'll build in the upcoming videos and I hope you'll like that portfolio website so what I'll do is I'll start with a very simple Django template and we'll take things forward from there so we'll create a portfolio website from the next video onwards and that website will actually host you our developer portfolio so if you are a developer or if you want to be a web developer whatever you want to become you can use that website to display all your skills you can showcase your talent there you can put whatever you have built there and that will be an entry point for the recruiter to go to and learn more about you so it's a very useful website for all the developers out there and I want you to have one as well and obviously we created using Django so I am really very excited for my upcoming videos if you weren't excited as well make sure to drop a comment down below so that I may know that you are also interested in the videos that I'm going to create for now and that's about it guys thank you so much guys for watching this video and I will see you next time [Music]
pHQj9dVw5OA,"in a previous video we looked into how Django works word Django is and also how this course is structured in this video I'm gonna be explaining you how Django works along with HTML CSS j/s and what all these things are and what is the rule of which particular technology so I'm gonna be explaining you all this now because you might have heard of HTML CSS JavaScript and we are talking about Django already in this course in this video I'm gonna be explaining you a where HTML CSS in JavaScript works if somebody asks you a very simple question what do I need to build a website what should be your answer your answer should be you need HTML CSS and JavaScript to build a website now you might ask me here he told me that Django is very useful very powerful where is Django surprisingly Django is not at all required to build a website you can simply pull a static page using HTML CSS and JavaScript let me explain and explain you why Django is not required and why Django is required to build complex websites Django just manages how HTML CSS and JavaScript is sent to the client we look into this in details but before that I want you to understand that one needs HTML CSS and JavaScript to build a website so if I talk about basic requirements necessary requirements to build a website HTML CSS and JavaScript who will work just fine now I just want to explain a little bit about HTML CSS and JavaScript roll using a very simple example I'm gonna be taking an example of a car so if you look into this car you can see that it has metallic body so if you go to some car factory you will see some metallic bodies which will have no color no design at all no engine this metallic body resembles HTML what is HTML HTML is hypertext markup language and all it gives is a simple structure to any website now what is CSS if I talk about the designs if I talk about this flight which is in shape of an eye this is CSS so I'll say color plus design it is very close to CSS in the world of websites now if I talk about the engine I will say engine the engine and I'll see engine is my JavaScript because it is the client-side programming language CSS is styling language and hTML is the basic structure of the website now we will understand how a given website works how a website works is let us say you are here and you request a website from a web server let us say the web server is programming with Ericom programming programming with Harry calm this can be any web site it can be google.com youtube.com instagram.com or any website that you wish to make requests to now this is the client it will say hey server at programming with Harry calm give me programming via harry cohn slash index dot HTML it will say something like this which is the URL so I'll just write pwh com in short I will say that give me pwh com slash index dot HTML the server will say ok let me look into your requests and see if I have to respond it it will say ok you are asking for some page which is available so ok I'll give you the response it will prepare HTML CSS and JavaScript it will prepare it what do I mean by prepare it might pull some data from the database it might you know simply serve a static page it might also do some calculations and produce some sort of HTML CSS and JavaScript dynamically such kind of websites are called dynamic websites if I am NOT simply serving HTML CSS in JavaScript it is called dynamic website and if I'm serving static HTML CSS in Java script what I mean by static is that the file is already stored in the server and what I'm doing is simply sending the file to the client if I'm generating it as per the clients request it is called a dynamic website and a dynamic website is driven by a back-end a back-end can be PHP a back-end can be Django back-end can be some sort of framework like angular or it can be something like nodejs so you can use anything in the back end and the back end will do the processing and the processing means generation of HTML CSS and JavaScript we are using Django here because you want to use Python if you want to use JavaScript in the backend you might go for node.js or denno if you want to use PHP you can go for PHP but if you use Django you can use the power of Python you can do all sort of machine learning that is inbuilt in Python through modules like scikit-learn and tensorflow you can use those modules install those modules and very quickly build machine learning prototypes I personally love Django a lot now this framework will generate some sort of files like HTML CSS and JavaScript and it will send it back to the client now once these files are sent to the client these files are not readable by the client I repeat these are not readable by the client so Klein by default through his computer by installing a program called web browser which is Chrome in this case it gives it to web browser the client says that hey web browser I don't understand HTML CSS in JavaScript what is this convert it in the form of a beautiful page and show it to me browser says oh well master I'll do the same for you let me do it for you quickly and this happens in the matter of milliseconds so once these three kind of files are processed you see what you see in the web site so if you enter google.com you see a very beautiful page a search button you see I am feeling lucky button all those sort of things are generated dynamic and the HTML CSS and JavaScript is sent to your web browser your web browser process all those files and what you see is actually the processed HTML CSS in JavaScript now if you click a button or maybe you select something and you can do all sort of stuff you can interact with the pages all sort of events that you produce in a browser for example you might click you might say control click or you might press a key or maybe you you know drag an item to some other location all those sort of things are called events and all the events are handled using JavaScript which is a programming language this programming language works within your browser so role of Django here was just to generate these HTML CSS in JavaScript and guess what this is the most trickiest part in fact this is more than 70% of the work that a server has to do generate HTML CSS in JavaScript because once the HTML CSS and JavaScript has been generated it is sent to the client and you are done so we'll see how all these things work in action but for now just understand HTML 4 basic structure CSS for styling JavaScript fault client-side scripting and what about Django or any other back-end programming language for that matter it's just producing or generating these HTML CSS in JavaScript and a framework like Django makes it super easy for you to generate these HTML CSS and JavaScript based on the clients request based on the clients request what is a client request client request might look something like programming with era dot-com slash about programming with Harry calm slash messages programming with Harry calm slash sign up slash login facebook.com slash messages all the sort of requests now requests can be of multiple type like get and post and we'll see what these get and post requests are in our future videos but for now just think of this entire process as a client sending some sort of request to a web server and web server has to respond now web server might as well say that hey I don't want to give you this page this page does not exist or you are not authorized to use this page all sort of HTTP codes can be sent by a web server and we'll see how all these things work in action but for now I hope you have a very clear idea of how a given website works now role of HTML I just want to emphasize a bit more on the role of HTML why do you want to learn HTML and what hTML is HTML stands for hypertext markup language it is the language of the web it is the standard markup language which gives a basic skeleton to a given website so if you see a website from 1998 or 1997 you will see it has a very poor styling it has just the structure and just the amount of information that it needs to have and it doesn't take user experience into account all the sort of websites are written just using HTML without any CSS or JavaScript now it's tml will give your website a basic structure but again it will not look like a modern website the look and feel will not be that good and you know you'll not be as happy as you want to be as a web developer so you should use CSS to style your websites if you want to have borders if you want to have animations if you want to have different sort of colors in the background in the border and you know in the navigation bar if you want to resize your images CSS is the thing for you CSS stands for cascading style sheets and all it does is style your web pages which are written using HTML so you have an HTML tag and that HTML tag can be styled using CSS if you target that HTML properly so I might say that all the TDs in my table should be of color red and the background should be yellow now this might not look very good but I just want to give you an example so I can write some CSS like this and I can target different types of elements using IDs using classes we will see all this in action in our videos so you don't have to worry much about this it just makes a website beautiful and modern looking you just have to understand this much for now now let's go into the role of JavaScript javascript is a client-side dynamic interpreted programming language which means that once HTML CSS is received by your browser what you can do is you can respond to user events if a user clicks on something if a user submits a form or maybe a user drags an item to some other div or other container for that matter you can respond to all those events using JavaScript programming so the JavaScript program is written inside JavaScript and it is embedded in inside HTML and even the CSS is embedded inside HTML so your HTML contains JavaScript as well as the CSS both of these things are contained inside HTML we'll see how all this happens but for now just remember that javascript is used for client-side scripting client-side scripting that's it now the most important part role of django what is the role of django why do you want to use django if HTML CSS and JavaScript is all required to create a a website why do you want to use Django I'll tell you why you want to use Django if you manually create HTML CSS and JavaScript for all the possible client requests it will get very exhaustive and very cumbersome for you to generate HTML CSS and JavaScript manually and keep it on the server what I mean by that is let us say you have a blog and you have 2000 blog post now 2000 blog posts are written by most of the bloggers in 3 to 4 years so it's not a big deal now if you keep 2,000 static pages and you observer that's not a reliable way let us say you keep these 2000 pages in the form of static HTML pages in your server and one day you think of restructuring your website will you go to all these 2000 pages and change the content one by one definitely you don't want to do that manually or programmatically you don't want to do that what you want to do is store the content of your blog inside a database have some sort of database manager and have some sort of CMS or a framework like Django in place which can simply do all these stuffs for you you know this was one of the examples there are many other reasons that you should go for a framework like Django one of which is using machine learning libraries that are already available in Python and many other image processing libraries which are already available in Python now why use Django and what is Django if somebody asked me what is Django I say it's a high level Python vector framework what do I mean by high-level high level means that you don't have to go into details you just still in a very layman terms - Django what to do by laymen terms I mean laymen in programming so if you want to another database query you can just say that I want to insert this in database you can simply use the the Django's built in ORM and simply you can read write update and you know do all sort of crud operations in the database this simply makes things easy for you and a web framework will do all these things for you and it will be very easy to maintain huge websites so you can you know do this rapid development in a clean and pragmatic design okay so this is one of the reasons second reason is it has a lot of built-in tools for example you want to create a tenth occasion system do you want to create authentication system from scratch if you want to quickly build a website and secure website what if you make a mistake while creating an authentication system your website might get hacked so what you want to do is you want to use Django's auth system which is already built into django so this is one of the reasons you want another reason you want to use Django is models you don't want to you know go to the database and rewrite the tables you want Django to take care of that and Django takes care of that in a very secure and optimized fashion so this was another reason to use Django now you can focus on writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel as I already told you that if you want to say create an authentication system you don't want to create it you can use Django spelled an authentication system or serializer or or you can simply use the things that are already built in triangle and you can also plug somebody else's app or somebody else's module which somebody else has created for you you can simply plug it in your Chango application and it works just fine and our the most important reason is that it's free and open source it's free absolutely free you don't have to pay a penny for this and it's open source which means that 24/7 developers are working to make it even better and better and with that we come to our next point which is it's fast secure and scalable with fast I mean that it has a very fast speed you will not find the mistakes that common web developers make in Django because it has already evolved over the period of years and it is getting better and better secondly it is secure because you get that security built in using the chango's auth system if you create an auth system from scratch you might you know come in a mistake in doing that and your website might get hacked but if you go for Django the auth system is already very secure now coming to the third point which is scalability if you get two to three billion users then you might get into trouble if you are using some sort of unmanaged way of serving data if you use a framework like Django it really makes it simple and easy for you to serve contents and maintain scalability at the same time I hope this discussion was very useful for you if it was let me know in the comments in a future videos we'll be creating a lot of projects so you don't have to worry about how these things work in action I am NOT a person will just tell you what hTML is is in JavaScript is without making any project I'll step by step walk you through the entire process but before that I want you to access this playlist if you haven't already you can go to my channel and you can click on playlists there are many people who are asking me that how much Python do I need to get started with this free django course i would say you can watch this learn Python in one video and it should be enough for you to get started and as and when we create projects I'll be telling you how things are working what all you need to you know make things work and how you can take your skills to next level if you want to build something more complicated then what we will build in this entire course with that said I want you to like this video and if you haven't already access the playlist just access in book market save the playlist thank you so much guys for watching this video and I will see you next time [Music]"
bMNdcMSe3pc,🚨 Error: 'text'
m53EEP5H6Sg,alright guys in this video we are gonna be talking about what classes and objects are and what object-oriented programming in general gives so what I'm gonna be doing is I'm gonna be opening my Python tutorial for beginners playlng I never want you guys to bookmark this playlist as I have done here so that you can see your playlist here and you can complete this course as soon as possible also if you are watching it on a mobile phone you can consider saving this playlist now for our classes and objects so I'm gonna be starting out by talking about object-oriented programming so if you google object-oriented programming it's not a pythonic term it's not something related to only Python it's a programming paradigm and what object oriented programming serves to a programmer is something that we are going to be talking about in this video so ugly xx programming is just a way of programming it's not a must thing it just has some moon advantages so I'm not gonna be diving deep into what object-oriented programming does what procedural programming does but I just wanted to point this out that so far what we did was procedural programming and now what you want to do is do you want to get into object-oriented programming the reason most of the package is most of the code that you see written in Python is written using object-oriented programming because it's easy to maintain it has several other advantages like you can easily understand the code the code flow and you can easily reuse the code so it comes with all these advantages and I don't want you to dive deep into the theory because I don't want you to learn something I don't want to promote all that so what I'll do is I'll simply create a Python file I'll say it Q torial 33 not py and I just want you to understand what Python classes and objects are so Python classes and objects are a way to model real world examples for example let us say we have some employee and I want to write some code for employee that can tell me what the salary of the employee is and I want to write some code which can tell me we can give me some way of changing the salaries the changing of increments that I'm giving that employee dear all those things so if I want to write a code that can do that it's actually easy for me to use object-oriented programming if I want to model it as a real-world scenario so anytime you want to model a problem as a real word scenario you got to be using classes and objects but now we'll see that how to use classes and option so many classes and objects in action so simply you just have to write class and just write employee now this will not make much sense right now but just follow me keep following me and you'll definitely learn what classes and objects are so I'll give you a very simple example let us say you have some employee and you have some employees that you are dealing with in your code base you have some students that you are dealing with in your code base now let us say we are talking about increasing the salary if you write a function to increase salary of an employee it does make sense to do so in case of employees but it doesn't make sense to do so in case of students because students have no salary similarly if we talk about marks it doesn't make sense when you talk about marks of an employee it does make sense to talk about the marks of a student so we can actually implement and incorporate all these things using classes and we can model our problem as a real-world scenario so what I'll do is and simply comment these out now you might be thinking how to model a given problem as classes and objects so I'll give you a very simple analogy and I'll simply doubt right now one of the classes and then I'll write adjectives and I'll say attributes and I'll save verb and I'll say methods now this is just an analogy I just want to give you a warning here I'll say this is a disclaimer this is just an analogy we don't have to take it literally so what I am going to tell you using this analogy is that whenever you see a noun for example employee student animal you can model it as a class whenever you see an adjective you can model it as an attribute and whenever you see a verb you can model it as a method for example cat walking animal can walk so animal dot walk walk is a method and you can make your animal walk that is the work and that can be modeled as a method so keeping these things into mind let us write our first class which is which I have already written and I have said class employee will give an indent and will simply write a method here so what we'll do is we'll say def and whenever you write def you have to say self comma and then I'll say salary or I'll simply say get salary also get salary and I'll say self and I'll say return self dot salary that's it now you might be thinking what I'm writing but I'll simply tell you what I'm writing so it's saying that instance of employee has no salary so we'll say salary is equal to 34 the same name is equal to hairy and now I am actually hard-coding the name but this is something that you will not do in the future but simply bear with me and keep watching the video I am simply modeling a very simple class and this will be our first class if you're watching this course so I will say e 1 is equal to I'll say employee ok and I'll say e 1 dot salary is equal to I'll simply says 766 let me run this code if I run this code I'll get nothing because I haven't printed anything I'll simply say print even dot salary and this should be printing 766 for me because I change the salary to 766 but if I comment this line out a 1 is equal to employee has actually created an object of employee ok so let me describe this program do you verse and then we'll keep printing whatever we want ok so I'll simply say hash and this is creating an object of class employee okay so we have created an object named II one of Las employee now what we are doing here is we are setting the salary of the employee to 766 we can do that the default salary of the employee is 34 as you can see here and the name of the employee is Hattie so this is a default name that I've given so if I print this I want you guys to comment below what the program's output is gonna be so I'll simply run this program now for you and it will be 34 because it's very straightforward the default value of salary is 34 so even Road salary will be pretending 34 for me now what I'll do is I'll simply uncomment this and the output of this program will then become 766 because I have changed the salary of this employee to 766 so instead of saying print even Road salary I can even say print even dot get salary now what get salary is doing get salary is actually returning the salary of this employee so I can run get salary function on an object of employee of employee class now if I run this program I'll see the same result so now it's saying employee is not designed defined let me see what the issue is something even dot get salary self not salary mmm line one module one okay so I think I didn't save this I have actually selected this and ran it I need to run it without selecting now if I run this it's telling me 766 then I can keep running it'll give me 766 now if I comment this line out I'll see 34 as you can see here so this is a very basic and simple class that we have written in Python now you might be thinking what object-oriented programming is we haven't talked much about the differences between object-oriented programming and procedural 4 oriented programming but I want you guys to sit back relax and keep following me keep following these videos and by the time you know what classes are or what classes and methods are what the self is doing and what these attributes are you'll definitely learn why we are using classes and outlets but for now if you're not able to answer this question why you're using classes and object I want you to pause for some time pause for a few more videos and in the future we'll see why they're using classes and objects and all the things that we have seen in object oriented part of this course will make sense so I hope you have accessed this playlist guys if you haven't already I want you guys to access this playlist and bookmark it so it shows up in the bookmark bar and also if you are watching it using a phone you can save this playlist if you haven't already subscribed the channel I want you to subscribe the channel so that you can actually access this course whenever you want

give me a thumbs up and I will see you next time [Music]
lsxt002Zups,in this video I'm gonna be explaining you HTML stands for hypertext markup language using HTML you can create beautiful websites and it is the very first thing that you should learn if you want to get into web development the web design services industry which comprises companies that provide web design services including the graphic and user design is expected to grow at an annual rate of 6.6% over the next five years it has also seen a rise of 6% in 2019 with a total of looping 38 point three billion dollars I know that I have thrown a lot of numbers in there so let's get right into it let's get started with HTML and let's create the very first website of a life before we start I want you guys to hit like on this video and tell me where you are from that way I can reply to your comments and I can give you any useful resource like cheat sheet or any link or anything that I come up with in future make sure to leave a comment down below web server serves you the requests in the form of HTML pages that HTML page contains CSS and JavaScript where the CSS is used for designing and javascript is used for front-end logic for example if you want to perform any computation in front-end you need to use JavaScript to get that done CSS is used to design the web pages to give the HTML skeleton a good shape this tutorial will cover everything you need to know about HTML and later after you have learned HTML you can move towards CSS and JavaScript which will be the next steps if you want to become a professional web developer HTML is like in a skeletal system of human body CSS is like the skin and the muscular system that gives your body good shape and JavaScript can be seen as the brain of the body wherein you write the logic on what happens when a button is clicked or what happens when somebody hovers over something or what happens after a certain amount of time all that logic is written using JavaScript so HTML for the structure for putting in the bare bones to the web page CSS for designing for giving a good look to those bare bones and JavaScript for client-side scripting having said that let's start with HTML and see what it has to offer in terms of putting a website together alright guys enough of talks let's get started so I'm gonna be starting off this by downloading via code now vs code is a cool editor this is a program that we are going to be using to edit our code efficiently and there is something called extensions in vs code that can actually help us out to make our coding experience better and we'll see this once we download vs code so what do you have to do is click for download for windows and once you click this you will see this installer and quickly you can open this installer I know you know how to install a software so I am NOT gonna be focusing much on that just click on I accept the agreement click on Next and click on next and keep clicking on next and install until this program installs for you I'm gonna be waiting for this to complete and I'll be back once this program is installed on my computer alright once you finish this installer it's prompting you to the start of Visual Studio I am gonna be clicking on finish and as you can see this starts off I already had this installed in my computer so I'm gonna be closing this because I already have a project open I'll say file and then I'll click on closed window and this will close this window and what I'll do now is create a new folder and right-click and then I will click on open with code and my visual studio code will open up now you can use this program to make HTML files I'm not gonna be focusing much on how to use vyas code you can explore that later I'm clicking on new file and I am gonna be writing index dot HTML now there's no need to only name your files as indexed or HTML you can choose a different name for your files as well but for the sake of simplicity I am just using index or HTML and people have been using this name a lot now what you can do is you can use this omit abbreviation and once you use this exclamation mark or by clicking shift and one you'll see this boilerplate so this is an amazing feature of vs code and this is why we download it vs code and this feature is called Emmet you can use such kind of abbreviations and we can make our coding experience very smooth we can code any kind of HTML very fast quickly efficiently happily let's get started so let's now try to understand what all this means but before we understand what all this means we will have to execute this and we'll have to open this using a browser our browser will take care of executing this file what I'm gonna be doing is I'll be clicking on extensions and then I'll write live server what is live server live server is a Microsoft Visual Studio code extension that can help you launch this HTML file live and you can actually enable this live reload feature you will not have to save this file and manually reload you can actually use this extension and keep saving your program and the updates that you make to your HTML file will be reflected into your browser you'll not have to go click your reload button again and again we'll see how this works in action I'm going to be clicking this cross button and then I'm gonna be closing this Explorer and we will understand what these lines mean but before that I'm gonna be writing something inside my body and I'll say this is body and I'll use ctrl s to save and then I'm gonna be clicking this goal live button once you click this go live button you can see that it gives you some morning and later it opens this development server for you on port 5 5 double 0 and you can change your content here and all those changes will be reflected here so if I change this to body 2 let me change it to body 2 and ctrl s you'll see that these changes are reflected here but before starting off with HTML and before starting what HTML is what body is what I'm gonna be explaining you about this boilerplate so the very first line in your HTML code is the doctype and this specifies that this file is an HTML file this is the significance of the very first line in the HTML file feet right then second line is the HTML tag so these are the mandatory tags that you have to use in any webpage you create first one is the HTML and once you have an opening tag you will also have to have a closing tag so this might sound confusing to a beginner so let me explain you by creating a new file and typing all this manually so I will say manual Road HTML you can use any name of your choice all you have to do is use dot HTML extension and you should be good to go so what I'll do is I'll say HTML firstly I'll copy this doctype line now the stock type line is optional but you should always start your HTML files with the stock type HTML and then you can say something like HTML and then a closing tag HTML now for me my visual studio code is giving me a closing tag whenever I try to write an opening tag of HTML because it is smart enough to figure out that I'll have to close HTML if I open it now the tag that is inside this HTML is head tag so I'll say head and I'll press ENTER and as you can see that visual studio code is again smart enough to figure out that I'll have to close this heading tag if I open it so as you can see HTML head and inside that I'll say title and then I'll say this is a title ctrl s to save and after head comes body and say this is body so this is how the HTML file looks like first of all you have this doctype HTML declaration and then you have this HTML and is equal to e and non lang is equal to en is not mandatory it's optional but again you'll have to open your HTML tag to start your web page then comes head tag where you specify your title you specify all your meta tag meta tag is meta information about your web page and you should not worry much about it at this point in time but we'll we'll talk about meta tags meta tags are used for SEO with sands for search engine optimization and that is also an important thing so we'll get back to this meta tag once we are done with other important stuff now once you have this head tech completed and your body text starts and inside your body tag is the meat of your webpage wherein you will type everything that will show up inside your screen so if I say this is body 2 you can see that I have this is body 2 if I say this is 43 I'll have this as body 3 so basically hTML is a markup language for web pages it is a way of telling a web browser what to display when to display where to display how to display so this is a way of us talking to web browser telling web browser what to do when to do and believe me it is very easy and you are gonna enjoy learning HTML alright so now what we'll do is we'll start off by creating a paragraph and a heading now HTML comprises of different tags and different tags have different rules so I'm gonna be introducing you to the very first tag which is heading tag so there are six heading tags in HTML h1 h2 h3 h4 h5 and h6 if I use H 1 this is H 1 and so this is h1 and then and you ste capital e and then I'm gonna you be using my video suitable shortcuts you can copy this line and paste it again and again and then what I'll do is I'll use my multi cursor functionality from BS code if you press your alt key down and you click on different places you will find this find these multiple cursors so I'll make this 2 then once again I'll do the same thing I'll make this 3 I'll press and hold my alt key and then I'll click my h1 h1 h1 here and then I'm gonna be pressing backspace and then for once again I'll do the same thing for 4 these tags as well so I'll make this one as h5 and this one as h6 and we'll see how these tags are different from each other so we have h1 to h6 here let me save it and you can see that the h1 is the biggest one among these in size h2 little smaller then comes h3 then h4 h5 and h6 so there are 6 heading text I'm gonna be choosing h3 because this looks like a right choice for me for say ecommerce website that I'm gonna be building so I'll use this h3 tag so so I'll get rid of this h2 and press ctrl slash on my keyboard to comment this out and this is by the way HTML comments now you'll think that what this comment in HTML is now whenever you write code inside your HTML file and you want to temporarily disable some lines and you want to see those lines once again you can comment those lines or you want some lines not to execute not to get passed by your browser you can use this you can use the angular opening bracket and then exclamation mark double dash and once you do that you are inside a comment so I'll say this is a comment and if I save and I go back to my web page you'll see that I have this is h3 written and nothing else but if I don't wrap this inside a comment you can see that I have this is a comment and this is h3 so if I want this is a comment to not get passed by my browser I will have to enclose it inside this this is part of HTML markup language and you are gonna be using it often how while you create your websites so this is the first thing that I wanted to tell you then comes a paragraph tag so I told you what heading this now we will use a paragraph tag and we'll write a paragraph so writing a paragraph tag is as simple as writing a P just ride a P plus enter and a visual studio code will do the rest for you now most of you guys must be thinking why am I using Visual Studio code why not notepad or sublime text you can use any editor of your choice visual studio code is a nice reliable convenient source code editor for me and I like it I like the shortcuts I like the feel I like the look so I'm using it and the fact that I can autocomplete these things the fact that I can over the elements and see what this element does and all those things is awesome for me so having said that I am gonna be writing some content inside my a paragraph so long so this is content inside my paragraph control is to sale and if I go back to my page you can see this is content inside my paragraph and I'll say this is paragraph heading I can change this to this is paragraph heading and you can see that I have this this is paragraph heading this is concerned content inside my paragraph being shown now you can use right click and view page source to view the source code of this file the exact source code that we have written ignore the source code as this is injected my life server extension that we are using you don't have to worry about this code but rest of the code is exactly the same could that we wrote along with the comments I want to give you some warning error if you are using comments to store some confidential information do not do that because in HTML your viewers will be able to see your comment and they might look into your confidential information if you are reading it inside comment so you have to be very vais you have to be very clever while writing these comments because when you are writing these comments they will actually be seen by different people who visit your webpage so you will have to be very clever when you do that another thing that I want to point out here is that you might think that this web page is not looking as good as say YouTube home page or say some other home page if you go to some website I'll just say website and I'll open some website and you can see that these websites are pretty good they look very fancy they have colors design we'll get to that and that is done using CSS we will see how to design a website that looks like this how to add images and all the good stuff but the very first step in learning web development is this thing the basic HTML now you can see that the title of this document is just document and if you want to inject something here so what I'll do is I will write this is title can do is to save and without reloading you can see I have this title being shown here so this is the title of the web page and this is how HTML works so once again HTML stands for hypertext markup language it contains a series of tags which are used for different kind of purposes for example if we use heading tag for specifying headings paragraph for writing paragraphs we have table tags we have image tags we have anchor tags we look into these tags later but HTML elements are represented by tags and that's the gist of it now HTML elements are used to tell your browser hey browser you have to display this thing in this fashion this is a way of talking to the machine or talking to a program which is web browser we want to tell every browser that hey web browser we want to do this we want to execute this you want to see or this is paragraph heading here you want to see the content here and you want to see an image here all those kind of talks that we do with the web browser are done in a language called HTML HTML is not a programming language it is a markup language it is the structure that we tell and that we create using markup language and we show it to a browser for it to interpret it further I hope it makes sense we started our discussion talking about this doctype HTML which tells our browser that this document is written in html5 then we have this HTML tag which is used to which holds the entire HTML document then we have had which contains the heading the title all the style sheets that we in the future all the meta tags are contained inside head tag now the meat of a page the the thing that we see is inside a body and this body is close here now if you're using Visual Studio code you can collapse your body you can collapse your head you can collapse this HTML tag as well and you can see other tags so this feature of code folding helps a lot when you have a lot of lines inside your code you can click like this to open it once again and you can click this to collapse it so you can open body like this then you can close body like this head like this you can keep closing and opening so these are the most crucial tags that an HTML document has to contain now we'll talk about the tags that we can use inside body and they are h1 tag h2 h3 h4 h5 h6 then we talked about paragraph tag and we saw how these tags are rendered by our browser so talking about the basic syntax the basic syntax goes like this so you have some tag and then you have the closing tag and then you write something inside this tag so this is the opening tag this is the closing tag the tag can be h3 tag can be anything I just wrote this tag to mean h1 h2 h3 PE or any other tag that you will use so this is how the basics index of HTML looks like now that we know that only the content inside body is displayed by the browser we can start writing our web page inside our body tag so you can start off by writing comments so you can start off writing some tags and as and when you type the tags your page will keep changing if you're using life server one thing to note down is all life server is doing is to reload your page whenever you save it if you save this page this page gets loaded that's it you don't have to use live server always you can always open this file like this using Google Chrome and you should be good but I'm using this extension because I'll get this feature of live reloading whenever I change my page another thing I want to point out here is that you can use anything you can use notepad to edit your HTML file and you should be good but I am using Visual Studio code as it helps in developing complex websites it gives you a lot of features you can save a lot of time that would have rather spent in typing a lot of code you can use omit abbreviation and talk more about omit abbreviations soon alright guys so now we know basics of HTML I'm gonna be raising all of this and we'll just keep one comment and we'll see our website starts here and then I'll have a heading I'll I'll change it to what is HTML and say hTML is the language of the web it stands for hypertext markup language markup language and I'll keep on adding few tags here and I'll keep on explaining you what those tags mean so I'm gonna be starting off by anchor tag and I'll say e but before that let's see how our website looks now it looks like this let me capitalize this w and now I'll introduce you to anchor tag and anchor tag like all the other HTML tags most of the HTML tags has an opening tag and a closing tag and inside these opening and closing tags we have something so I'll say a click here to go to Google so I'll say click here to go to Google I'll simply press ctrl s and you can see you can see click here to go to Google is here now let us assume I want it to be clickable you must have seen these links where in when you click you could do a different website all together I want to create a similar effect in order to do that I'll be using anchor tag and I'll say H F is equal to slash google.com in fact double slash google.com or let me completely write this address HTTP www.google.com you must have noticed something strange here that I've written something inside of the tag so this is called attribute in order to add some more information to the tag we use on something called attribute and we keep on adding these attributes like this for example I have used a hf attribute of anchor tag href means where to go and unclick so if i go to this web page and I click here I'll go to google.com I can use back button to come back to my page so this is what href pretty much does now I can specify something called target and I can make it under scope blank and if I can turn s to save and I come back to the page now if I click on this link it'll be open in a new tab so this is another attribute of anchor tag where it I can write underscore blank and if you hover over target it is telling me that the following keywords have special meanings and this co self will do this and this code blank will do this and just open and will do this but for now let's focus on underscore blank and let's keep this simple we are gonna be using only two attributes of anchor tag for now and we will move to the next tag so the next stack that I'm gonna be using is the image tag and image tag is really very interesting let me save this page and go to the web and grab some URL of an image so I'll click on this image I'll click on this image I'll simply go to open image in a new tab I'll copy the URL and I'll create an image tag I'll say I am G and then I will say SRC is equal to this link and just to make things simple I'll just click on the square button and then I'll say command palette and I'll simply type toggle word wrap and they'll click on this and this way I'll avoid seeing this horizontal scroll bar that was irritating me so that you guys can see my screen now this is Visual Studio code specific feature so you don't have to worry much about it now when I type I am G an important attribute of IMG is SRC which stands for source it means where to get the image from and there is something called Alt alt means what to show when the image fails to load so let me type it for what to show so maybe let me write image of website so whatever you write inside alt will be shown if this image fails to load let's see this into action you can see that this image is being shown up here now if I mess up with the URL obviously this image will feel to load and you will see this text now this is what this alt is about so there are two attributes for IMG that are important number 1 SRC another one is alt all now there are a lot of other attributes of different tags and I recommend you go to the internet search for these attributes and you'll come to know more about them but for now these are the most often used attributes of IMG tag I'll also get rid of this one just to keep things clean and as you can see let me also let me also fix this URL I'll fix this URL so that my image shows up and get rid of this line ctrl s to save and you can see that and this webpage looks pretty T send enough but not you know like google.com or any other website that you often visit these were filter design using CSS and JavaScript that are the next step we'll definitely look into those on this channel but for now we just want to learn basic HTML having said that I'll add few more paragraphs so I said what is HTML HTML is the language of the web I might as well create a the heading with h2 and I'll name it learning so let us say I want to create a personal website I'll say learning or and before that I name this title as Harry's personal website and let us say this is the website that I want to use for all the personal stuff no no let's to save and you'll see the title updated you'll see learning section and inside learning let us say I want to learn web design and I want to write about HTML and all that stuff I'll say what is HTML HTML is the language of the web it stands for hypertext markup language let me Google search and I'll get some text from the internet Wikipedia is a good place to start with I'll copy this text I'll put it here just to keep things simple and beautiful now it looks good but I also want to see some more content I want to see this click here to go to Google here I'll say that more on HTML here I will start another paragraph I'll say more on HTML hair and I'll enclose this hair with anchor tag I'll say HF is equal to and I'll copy this link from here I'll say HTML and we'll copy this link and we'll paste it here and say more can be found here and I'll enclose my where is my hair it's safe good now I'll remove this one I hope I'm not confusing you with the with all the text that I've put up here let me reload the speech and you can see that what is the HTML first of all I start with learning and I say what is HTML then I talk about HTML then I say more on HTML here the moment somebody clicks on here they are redirected to this page where I have made a Google search and they can simply learn more about HTML and once again I can also say something like more on something else here let us say I want to also talk about CSS I'll say more on CSS here and I'll simply change this query to CSS or you can also grab the link once again from from google you can simply search for CSS and once I search for CSS I get this link which points to the Google search results from CSS I'll say HRF is equal to double quotes and control V to paste ctrl s to save let me see how my website looks now it looks pretty good I have created a heading h2 tag then I've created another heading let me see is it an s2 tag or h1 okay it is an h2 tag I have created an h2 tag and then I've created an h3 tag and then I have added a paragraph and then once again I have added this hyperlink here using anchor tag and I can keep on adding more hyperlinks that I used IMG tag to to show I'll show this image here I can also use some other attributes from IMG to show this image more beautifully I will see 123 pixel and then I'll say height is equal to 123 pixel control is to save if I come back here I wondered is a pixel is too small let me change it to okay I made it 12 pixel for some reason 193 pixel 1 what is the pixel and it shows up exactly the way I want it now you can change the width in hide using the width and height attributes I want to tell you that width and height are the attributes of IMG tag and they'll not necessarily be available with other tags so you have to be very careful with the attributes you are using if the attribute does not belong to the tag you are using then you might be into trouble so since I known that SRC is something I can use with IMG and width and height is something I can use with Angie that's why I'm using this thing so I hope you get this now one of the biggest question that I get from the beginner HTML developers is that should I use a double quote or should I use a single quote and I'm gonna be throwing some light on that if I use a single cord instead of double code you can see that it works you can see that I can see my image here now I'll use the example of alt attribute from IMG if I use a single code and if I ctrl s to save and let me also change the URL so that it shows the alt text you can see that my alt text shows up now if I added double code inside of it I can see the double quote here so if I'm using double quote inside of the text I'll have to use single quote and if I'm using a single code inside I should be using double put and my single code will show up if I use the single quote and a single code inside I might run into trouble as you can see here I am into trouble my image single code and all these things are not showing up so you can use any of single or double quotes but make sure if you're using single quotes inside be sure to use double quotes if you're using double code inside make sure that you include your text inside single code I hope that makes sense before moving ahead I want to fix the URL so that Maya shows up once again and my website looks good as you can see that I have a learning heading Thai here then I have what is HTML here then I have some content here then I have some anchor tags here and an image tag here now I'll be talking about a horizontal rule if you put a chart like this and you ctrl s to save you'll find a line that looks something like this and this is a horizontal rule that you can use to make these lines and to separate out content for example I am using some other section for example this is learning and I want to add something called two dues so I will type to those Tod US and I want to separate these two sections so I made a horizontal rule here and I want to add a table here so before moving towards stable tag I want to talk about BR tag let us say you want to break line you want to you want programs to start in the next line after embed you can use something called BR as you can see here now if I go to my web page I'll see that I have a line break here HTML tags HTML can embed and then I have a new line here if I add some more BR tags here I'll have some more new line cells so I can keep adding these BR tags and I'll see this these spaces but again I'll avoid these and come back to table so HR is 1 BR is 1 VR will create a line break HR will create a horizontal rule these two are important HTML tags that can be used and since these are the tags that do not need any closing tag these are called void elements and the ones that we use having a closing tag are called non void elements so h2 is a non-void element h3 is a non-void element paragraph is a non-void element and then once again HR is a void MBR is a void and I am G is also avoid and we usually add a slash just to indicate that this is a void element although it is not necessary to include this but again you can do that so a void element will not have any content inside of them so these are the void elements having said that let's move further let's talk about some more tags I'm going to be talking about list before table because list is important and when we are creating something called todos we should be using lists now what is an HTML list let's talk about it now in HTML list can be primarily of two types one is ordered list and another one is an ordered list so if I write something called oh L this is a short form for ordered list and I can add list items so I can say I want it to be ordered I want it to be numbered I can say P and then once again I can say burger then I can say something like let's say Pisa ctrl s to save and let's see how it looks like so if I use ordered list I will find this number one number two number three when I code so when I use an ordered list I find this number one number two these labels in my elements so all the list items will be labeled if I'm using an ordered list if I use an unordered list rather I will see something called bullets so let me use an unordered list let me call it ul instead of L and I'll have to close it with ul if I'm opening it with ul and you can see that it changes two bullet points instead of numbers so you can always change these two ordered and unordered I'm gonna be using ordered here because I want to see those number one number two number three written alongside the list items let me come back here and let me use an ordered list o L o L controller so save and the moment I reload this I don't have to actually load this I'm using live server number one is TE burger pizza and let me see get T and let me see from store I'm just making it up now I'll show you something if you add an attribute called type here you can use these type attributes you can use one you can use capital a you can use these eyes let me write capital a here and I'll show you what happens you can see that number one number two number three changes to a B and C if I change this to I rather you see the Roman numbers being displayed if I change took capital I you'll see something else you will see those Roman numbers written in capital eyes so this is a type attribute and I want you to try out other type attributes that our list has so these were the two types of less in HTML one was ordered list and the other one was unordered list so let me write unordered list as well and the moment I see my vapid it looks something like this I have an ordered list and then I have an unordered list all right guys so we talked about a lot of HTML tags and elements now let's talk about table tag and as it is one of the most important tags as far as HTML is concerned now let us say you want to store information of some employees and let me start this right off using a heading I'll say employees kind of let's to save let me see how it looks like as employees now what I'll do is I'll start a table tag and I'll say table and my table tag begins here inside this table I can start a table row which is indicated by TR now this might sound little confusing if you are a beginner but let me tell you this is exactly the same template that you can use in the future so once you get what I'm doing here you'll be able to create your own HTML tables now I'll start a pH tag here I'll say serial number and then I'll say name and then I'll say employee ID or maybe Department and that should be good we'll add three columns to this table I'll start another table row and this time a table row will contain table data so it will not contain table heading so I'll say P D D D stands for table data I'll say one and the name will be Harry and then Department will be say Python development ctrl s to save and let's see how this table looks like oh wow this table looks like this let me add few more elementary students table let me press control D and I'm trying to add few more entries to this table number two number three Harry let me call it let me call it Stephen once again st e ven and let me call it see development analyst to save and let me see how my table looks like so this is how you can use tables in HTML now you can design these tables using CSS and I will be walking you through CSS very soon on this channel so if you haven't already subscribed you can consider subscribing to this channel now this is all about tables you can design your tables in a better way by using CSS by adding some borders by adding some colors there are a lot of other things that you can do but this is how a basic structure of table looks like moving away from tables I will be talking a little bit about forms as it is also one of the most important topics as far as HTML is concerned so let us say you want to take some survey I'll say h2 else's survey also please take our survey please take a survey kinda let's to save and I can start a form tag now there is an action attribute of form element and this means where to take all the entries of this form once it is filled let us say ah I want to take it to fill is not PHP now I don't want to teach PHP here I just want to tell you that action means where this form will get saved you'll have to write your custom PHP backend to save this form but I'll be walking you through a designing of the form so if you write input type is equal to text ctrl s to save and you'll find ah let me also add this name here you'll find this input tag here so please take a survey name you can say age then you can say occupation and then you can say income and here is a form name age occupation income just to remind you you can use BR tag to add a line break control C control V control V control movie ctrl s to save and you can see that this is how our form looks like you can use an input you can also use a textarea tag which is used to add a lot of text if you have a lot of text and you want to write a paragraph maybe you can consider using a text area so I'll sit description and I'll say text area and name is equal to let us say text ID is equal to X now columns and rows as you can already guess are the number of columns and a number of rows in your text area so if I save this you can see that we have 30 columns and 10 rows let me make it 5 rows so that our text area is short and I'll show you one more thing you can drag your text ad and make it bigger bigger and bigger and this goes on so this is how a text area is designed and you can add text area in your HTML forms too to take long inputs from the user so that you user can type seamlessly without not being able to see the text so this is how text area works now this was all about HTML forms now I want you guys to go to the internet and search for different HTML tags and different attributes and what all those attributes are doing there because there are a lot of attributes I cannot discuss each and every one here I discussed the most important ones and I wanted to just give you a quick start for the starting of HTML and designing web pages this is something that is for beginners and I want you guys to have this just as an entry point not as an exit point from HTML you guys must be going to internet after this video and you should type HTML tags and attributes and once you do that you'll get a whole bunch of links and all of these links are good believe me believe Google you can go to any of these links and you can start start experimenting with these tags and start reading websites now that you know how anchor tag works how paragraph works how heading works I hope this video was helpful if this video was helpful make sure to give me a thumbs up and on the design part let me tell you guys that I'm gonna be dropping out a CSS video very soon so we are interested please let me know in the comments below and make sure to like this video and subscribe to this channel so that you get notified whenever I drop in the CSS video thank you so much guys for watching this video and I will see you next time [Music]
4k9CphTdnWE,in this video we are gonna be coding and yeah virtual desktop assistant using Python skills that we have learned throughout this course cuz you guys must have heard of katana city and Google assistant there's a bunch of software's available in the market but I want you guys to understand how these things work behind the hood I want you guys to see how these things are coded and that's why I have come up with this video on AI virtual assistant I'm gonna be calling this virtual assistant as javis so will be coding Jarvis from scratch using Python in this video let me show you guys a demo have a look at this javis play music javis open YouTube who is Tom Cruise according to Wikipedia alright so I'll stop it now and you saw it works and it is awesome believe me before we start this video I want you guys to access my Python playlist if you haven't already done that I'll be dropping the link in the description also I want you guys to tell me your name in the comment section where are you from so that if I have anything to give you for example the source code the cheat sheet or anything that I'd come up with in the future I can directly reply to your comments so I want you guys to post a comment telling about yourself telling about where you are from and where your name is that way I can give you all the resources whenever I come up with anything so hit that like button drop a comment and join me in this journey where we create this desktop virtual assistant software in Python from scratch so I am NOT gonna be missing much of your time and as you can see I'm inside my computer guys enough of talks so let's start creating a virtual assistant now so I have this empty folder right here and I'm gonna be creating a new folder and I will name it in Chaves let me create this folder and I will open this folder I'll right-click here and I'll see a in fact I'll click shift and right click and if you press shift on your keyboard and you right click you will find an option called open this in partial or open this in come online so you'll find this option here as you can see that I have this partial open here I'll write code dot and once I do that I'll open visual studio code and if this doesn't work for any reason you can open visual studio code you can go to file you can go to open and you can click the head open folder file open folder and you can select the folder you want to open it can be anything you can open any folder here I have created a new folder called Jarvis I have opened that folder and now I'll be creating a new file inside that Javas folder so let me write main dot py and before I start I want you guys to access this python playlist if you haven't already because I have broken down each and every Python concept in this playlist I have taught you about strings I've taught you about numbers variables installation and everything so I want you guys to access this playlist I want you to bookmark it and save it if you haven't already having said that I'll start coding Chaves so there are a bunch of module in you you need to install and you can click on terminal here and you can click new terminal and by doing that you have your integrated terminal integrated vs code terminal open here and how it helps you is that you have your code and terminal on one screen so that makes work easy for you so I'll just import few modules I'll say import PI TT sx3 and you might be thinking what is that and I want you guys to Google this module and you'll find some more information about that and I'll be explaining widely using this module it's a text-to-speech model and we are gonna be using this to create Chaves in order to install this all you have to do is you have to type pip install and then you have to say pi TTS x3 if you add any error I want you guys to go back to the split and start learning everything from basics but again if you if you see some error like pip is not recognized so python is not recognized I want you guys to go to my channel and I have videos to solve those errors believe me and it will not take much time just open the channel and you'll find the relevant video let me wait for this to install and you can see that it was 8.4 mb/s and it could download it now it is getting installed and I'm doing this on a Windows operating system so it is getting installed pip takes care of everything I am waiting for it to install now I'll say import speech let me click it import speech underscore recognition and I'll say as Sr so why I'm doing this because I don't want to type speech recognition every time I want to write import speech recognition as Sr and I can say s R instead of a speech recognition whenever I want to call speech recognition so I can install this model by saying pip install a speech recognition and you have to type exactly like this I'm going to be copying it and I will paste it as comment so I'll say you can install it using pip install speech recognition and once again you can pip install PI TDS x3 and this is nothing but text to speech to text model okay so you we can use this model and this is text to speech model whatever you type it'll speak for you and it is really very useful for you guys so let me once again open my videos to decode and let me put few more modules I'll import date/time do not get scared with me importing these modules we are gonna be using it we you'll create projects which will have tons of modules so do not worry so Wikipedia this is a module wherein we can access Wikipedia right from a Python programs or as a pip install Wikipedia and I'll be writing it here as common so that you guys can access it and you guys can run this command and install Wikipedia and whatever module am installing here I'll say import web browser and I will also import OS and you don't have to worry about why I am importing all this because I am gonna be explaining you a step by step and I'm gonna be importing SM TP Li be SMTP lav so I miss this ctrl s to save and I'm only guys to run this program as soon as possible and many you run this program you should not see any error okay so I'll type print and also initializing and also Jarvis ctrl s to save and I will expect initializing Jarvis on my output window so you can see that I have this printed right here and we can start working now so what I'm gonna be doing is I'm gonna be typing few lines of code and I'll be writing some functions so that I can and group thirteen things together so I'll be writing a function called speak so I'll say def speak and this function will pronounce whatever I give it as a string so I'll say text and I'm gonna be saying Engine dots say audio and then I'll say engine dot run and wait so it will run and we'll wait for for this audio to pronounce so if I say speak Harry is a good boy let's try it cancer speak I'll say howdy is a good boy control is to save and I'll run this program and you guys will see Harry is a good boy okay so it says engine is not defined so I did not define the engine my bad so what I'll do is I'll say engine is equal to and this will come from PI TTS x3 got in it and then you'll have to say s API so as soon as you type in it it will say what is the name of the driver give me the name of the driver so if I say something like s API 5 and if I say voice is is equal to engine dot get property and I'll say voices and if I print the boy just give me all the voices that I have installed on my system I'll say ok engendered set property and I want to set voice and I want to set it to let me save voices 0 dot ID and this should work now because I have everything set up now I'll run this program I am waiting for it to finish so it says audio is not defined there's something wrong here ok so I need to say text because the name of my string is text I'm making a lot of mistakes here but again it's a part of your okay so here is a good boy it said that and we are successful so far so we are successful in creating a speak function which will speak for us so congratulations and let me write a dog string here or maybe a simple comment because I don't want to make things complicated by using words like dog string I'll just put a comment on top at the top of the function I'll say ok the speak function will speak this string or rather pronounced this string a string which is passed to it that's about it and we are successfully able to run our speak function I will comment this line out because I don't want my job is to say and had is a good boy as so as soon as it is initialized but again it's a good idea to make it speak initializing javis whenever it starts so I'll say speak initializing Jarvis let me run this code and waiting boy it's saying initializing java's if I put three dots it will pronounce it little slow D is what I expect initializing Chaves come on it's taking some time and it said that ok so what I'm gonna be doing now is I will create a few more functions and then we will make it - bunch of tasks for us so let me get another function and it will wish me so I'll say wish me and I want job is to wish me when it gets initialized because I'm a Miss master and you know you should respect your master so if I created javis it should respect me so I'll say okay wish me so I'll say our is equal to date time dot or or rather let me input from date time input date time or if I do import date time I like something like this date time dot date time and then I'll say dot and I'll say now and I was a dot our let me print this I just want to see what it returns if I print our and if I print wish me or rather if I run this function wish me and I can also run this by typing Python main dot py because there's nothing but a terminal so you're sprinting fifteen so not died so far so it's sprinting the hour so it is 3:00 p.m. so it's printing fifteen for me if it's something else for you to print the corresponding number if it's 12:00 a.m. for you to print zero for you if it is let us say 11:00 a.m. it will print eleven for you and so on so we have this hour now I want you guys to understand something this hour is a string so I want you guys to enclose it inside in so that we can create it we can convert it to an integer so now our is an integer or output is not really change here it will remain as fifteen but again you will find you will not find difficulty if you compare it with some number so if I say okay if our is greater than equal to zero which means it's 12 a.m. and Beyond and and our is say less than 12 which means it's before 12 p.m. in the afternoon and it's after 12 a.m. night then I wanted to speak good morning so I'll say okay speak good morning morning I will also say master master name is equal to Harry and I want to set this global variable and say okay all you have to do is you have to speak good morning and the name of your master that's it so it will let me let me type master at the very top when I'm writing all this as okay master is equal to Harry and I'll put it in caps and why I'm putting it in caps because it is a constant and I want I don't want it to change so I just want to say master and also I want to call wish me but again it's not gonna run because it will not go inside my if statement why because our is not greater than equal to zero and it's not less than 12 it's not morning it's after noon going on at my end so I'll say ok and if otherwise if hour is greater than equal to 12 if hour is greater than equal to tell and hour is less than 18 which means it's before 6:00 p.m. and after 12:00 p.m. in the afternoon you have to speak good afternoon Harry so I won't expect you to speak good afternoon Harry not you I want chaves chaves to speak it for me good afternoon master whatever the master is you guys can change the name of the master to yourself because I don't want your Jarvis to say good afternoon Harry I wanted to say your name okay anyways I'll say okay otherwise you have to say good evening so otherwise you will say good evening and we are good to go I think that that's all that should be good so I'll just clear my terminal you don't have to do that but again I like nice and clean terminal initializing Chaves so it's a good afternoon Harry and I like it good afternoon javis I'm good okay you didn't ask me that how are you and how may I have a pee or something I want you to speak that as well so I'll say speak good afternoon Harry I am Jarvis Jarvis how may I help you okay how may I help you sir let me long distance again initializing Jarvis okay I'll tell you javis how you can help me but give me some time to code you I am still coding you Travis anyways so this is our wish me function wherein I gave it the hour in fact I gave it nothing I generated and the current hour using my date/time module I printed it hour I don't want to print that anymore I just you know remove that then I said if hour is greater than equal to zero which means it's the morning before 12:00 p.m. after 12:00 p.m. you have to speak good morning Harry if it's after 12:00 p.m. before 6:00 p.m. I want you to say good afternoon otherwise you have to say good evening I think that sounds great we are good with this wish me function I want you guys to minimize this function if you don't know how to minimize it you have to go to the start of the function you'll find this arrow and this is nothing but you can collapse a given function and you can make your code look a little cleaner and you can have a bird eye view at your code I think that makes sense and you will definitely use this feature and you'll like it so I have minimized my speak function and I have also collapsed this wish me function and this is where my main program starts so let me write it here mean program starts in that should be good yeah so my Chaves is initialized and is it has already wished me now what do what do I want I want my job is to take some command and do something for me because I don't want job is to sit idle I wanted to take some come on and do something for me because I don't want people who do nothing so I'll say ok take command so I'm giving it take command I'm not giving anything to it I'm saying ok take come on and I want something in return I'll tell you what I want so this this function will take let me write let me write about the swish me function first I'll say this function will speak I will not speak I will actually speak but let me call it speak I don't want it to what an animal right it will call speak function because you know what speak function is doing I'll say this function will speak or rather will wish you as per the given time as per the current time and then this this particular take command function this function will take come on from the microphone and that's all I have to say for now I'll go inside this function and I will start writing the code all right so how do you take the microphone input in the day sounds rate little tricky right it's actually very very easy I'll tell you why all you have to do is you have to use this speech recognition module and there's a class called recognizer and all you have to do is you have to create an object of the class if you don't know what all this is I want you two guys to follow and because we are creating an awesome project right here I want you to type s r dot microphone which is a context manager and as souls and then we'll print listening so listening and it will start listening and I will say okay audio is equal to r dot listen which is a function and it will listen the source so what I would microphone you are using you can use the input given to that microphone and it will start listening to that all right so as soon as you are done speaking it will exit and it will say okay try and I'll print recognizing to print recognizing and after that you can say query is equal to r dot recognize Google and why I am doing this new audio and language is equal to e and I n so English India I am from India so what I'm saying English India you can say English us or whatever you feel like but it's not going to make much of a difference all you have to do now is you have to say ok I'll say F strain and use said and I'll say query ok query and backslash and ctrl s the same I think that was enough that's too much I haven't explained anything but please hold on please hang on for a while and I will explain you each and every line whatever I am writing so after that I'll say ok except if if you're not able to do something except exception as if something fails what to do you can say something like say that again please or you can make Java speak hey say that again please I'll just say that again please and that's all I want to do if it fails I think we should now be sure we should run this and we'll see whether it's working or not so I'll run this program I'm fading bye ok oh I I forgot to run this function my bad I was supposed to run this function because I haven't called this function anywhere how is it supposed to do something for me I'll turn it once again it'll say initializing Java it'll say good afternoon hurry ok hey I want you to sing a song for me oh wow that's great I think we have already coded 70% of Java's but now how do we make it do something we have recognized user input we have user input as as a string at our disposal now I want you guys to close this terminal to you know to make some room for the colon I want to zoom in so that you guys can see my code nicely so accept exception as E and sailor again please so if there is some problem with your microphone or if you if you are not able to speak properly maybe if you are too far away from the microphone then it will say okay say that again please I didn't get that it's if it's not able to recognize so basically what we are doing this we are using Google's engine to recognize the audio that we're that I'm giving in from the microphone and I'll do one more thing here I'll remove the speak statement from wish me and I'm doing it I'm disabling it temporarily because I don't want it to say how may I help you I am job is how may I help you again and again because I don't want to be as much of your time and you can uncomment this line it'll look cool I have commented it to save some time here because if I run this program over and over again it will keep on saying that I don't want that so we have this take command function we have we have raided an object of recognizer class we have used Hassad microphone context manager and it's listening now we are making it to listen our source microphone and then it is recognizing using Google's engine I think I think we are good so far now what it should be able to return it should be able to return something and I wanted to return what has been sent so I'll say okay return me the query but what if it's not able to recognize if it's not able to recognize 20 will be none query will be none okay good I think that sounds good okay so we have this state command function done now we can start working on other stuff now we have this Rashmi function we have this take command function so I'll say query is equal to T come on and if I print the query it will be it will be displayed on my screen and I don't want to do that because I want to use this query to do something else and I'll tell you what so we can now make it do a bunch of cool stuff so let me start by saying okay so I'll say logic for executing basic tasks or executing tasks as per the Espada quali so I'll be coding the logic here and the logic is if if you have Wikipedia in query which means you have said something about Wikipedia I'll say speak searching Wikipedia so if you have who is if you say who is strong Cruz according to Wikipedia I want you to say ok wait we are searching Wikipedia for Tom Cruise so that's what I wanted so I said ok speak searching Wikipedia and query is equal to query dot replace oops [Applause] so I'll be replacing query and I'll be replacing it I'll be removing Wikipedia problem and why I'm doing that I'll be telling you very soon so if I say every key pedia if you say something like this Vickie pedia and you say Tom Cruise I don't want to search that Wikipedia inside Wikipedia idle I just want to search Tom Cruise so I want to remove Wikipedia from my query I hope you got that so I'll use my Wikipedia module that we have imported here and if you haven't already imported this Wikipedia module I have already told you how to install it ok so so far so good I'll save Wikipedia dot summary and I'll say query analysis sentences is equal to let me see two sentences ok so I want to address something here you guys might be thinking where am i bringing this Wikipedia dot summary from and where am i bringing all the functions that I'm using here by TDS X 3 dot in it how do I know that I have to use this function so I want you guys to know that you can go to the modules documentation and they have mentioned how to use it properly there so if you if you search a PI TTS X 3 if you search it on google I've already made a Google search you can go and you can type Doc's and you'll find something there and you can read about the documentation read about how this model was built and how to use it to implement all these things so you can see the examples are right there you can read you can use it I have already gone through these examples and I'm using one of these here so you guys should not struggle with why I am writing in it and why I am writing get property set property and where is all this coming from all right so we are saying that okay search Wikipedia for this query and return me two sentences and once those sentences are returned I wanted to speak all those results and let me see whether it works I'm running it okay good afternoon hey who is Tom Cruise according to Wikipedia say hey who is Tom Cruise according to Wikipedia so this is something that we have done so our Wikipedia so so we have you've got a problem here so did you see the problem why it didn't go inside this for loop it didn't go inside the for loop because hey Wikipedia is capital and and here we keeping it small so how do I address that I'll say query dot all over and let me run this okay who is Tom Cruise according to Wikipedia now it's searching Wikipedia for me did you see that is an American actor and film producer vow it works guys it works let me close this program so I have stopped this program and as you guys saw that it's able to search for Tom Cruise it's able to go to the Wikipedia servers written the results for Tom Cruise and any and it's able to speak it for me so what I'll do here is an C I'll print results and also I will bring it little down and you guys can do it once again the problem with our initial approach was that we did not convert this query to lowercase a query contained Wikipedia in uppercase and we want to convert everything to lowercase and we want to match it with lowercase so if my sentence contains this word Wikipedia I will be going inside this if statement I'll be speaking or rather my Jarvis will be speaking searching Wikipedia and it will do all the work for me so all I have to do is sit on my couch and say what is something according to Wikipedia or Wikipedia Tom Cruise it will tell me about Tom Cruise or Wikipedia anybody you can say Wikipedia Harry Potter you can say Oh Wikipedia anything anything even the speaker spider-man Wikipedia Batman movie key pedia Arnold Schwarzenegger anything you can even know anything all right so normal say I live and if open YouTube inquiry if my query contains open YouTube what to do I'll use this web browser module and I'll save web browser to open and I'll say youtube.com and it will open youtube.com for me and that should work alright so I'll let me test this one now oops I have made some mistake what is that okay so this should this should come outside the indent so I have to make this in line with this because this is a if this is this this Alif is corresponding to this if statement and as we have already seen in this video or if else video is a if else video it said if else conditionals I have already explained you everything anyways coming back to a job is let me run this program once again and this time I'm going to be saying open YouTube and once again we have committed the same mistake and I should be saying query dot lower and I'm not gonna repeat this mistake once again I'll say open you do once again let it initialize hey open YouTube javis alright so we have this YouTube open a vowel it works and it is opening it in Internet Explorer 11 and I don't want it I wanted to open it with Chrome so I'll just could Google and I'll find out how to use this web browser module to open Chrome so I'll say web browser open in Chrome okay and I'll find something something on the Internet Python web browser door open to open Chrome browser so let me see if someone has posted something something useful here so you can say chrome path is okay so this guy has given some code here so he's pretty much saying that you can pass chrome path to your program and you'll find out where chrome is and then you can use this okay so sounds good I'll use this and I'll also and I also want you guys to look at this answer here is a title if you surges exact title you should be you should be here on this stack overflow page so let me see if somebody else has posted something everyone has posted similar thing okay so there's something called using is equal to google chrome this sounds good to me but let me see if it works so let me try this one ctrl C and let me see if this works using is equal to web browser to get using is equal Google Chrome dot open and URL is equal to youtube.com and this sounds good to me let me say new is equal new what is that new let me let me see I knew is equal to open in a new tab if possible so I don't want it to open in a new tab so I just say I'll just say to here if I'll be opening in a new tab oh you can also remove this one it's not necessary open YouTube javis alright saying cannot locate runnable browser and I think this is this is a problem so I'll be switching back to this approach which is Windows Chrome path and this sounds pretty promising to me so let me say okay chrome path is equal to I'll just I'll stick to my Windows chrome path I'll remove Windows and just press tab tab once again to you know sorry I'll press tab here I'll click here and trap let me press backspace okay so let me see where my chrome path is so this might work but once again it might not fall because micro might be installed somewhere else but I'll give it a go I'll give it a go and if it doesn't work I'll see where Chrome is installed on my system so let me run this program and let me say open YouTube javis open YouTube javis alright it works wow it really works but once again if it doesn't work for you it means that you don't have your Google Chrome installed here you need to find out where your Google Chrome is installed and you have to pass on the correct path but again this should work because I'm also on Windows I just copy/paste it just blindly from Stack Overflow and it worked so it should work for you as well I will say open YouTube in query dot lower URL is equal to this I'll say okay if if ctrl C and say if open Google in query dot lower I'll say okay my url is google.com it'll open google.com and if I want to visit let us say a Stack Overflow but I put a but I don't visit Stack Overflow home page directly in fact who has seen a Stack Overflow home page just give me a comment tell me in the comment section if you have seen Stack Overflow collar of home page I don't I don't open those stack overflows I just called the corresponding answer and I just read the answer and and I go away anyways if you want to open stack overflow you can type any URL it can be anything if you open give you open let us say reddit you can say open read it and you'll have to change the URL as well so also read it vanilla so save run this program it will say initializing Chaves and I will give it some command hey job is I'm really bored I want you to open read it for me wow it worked haha this is great I can even say that I'm bored or something and and it worked Wow much of fishable and we have just imported bunch of modules and we have written some if-else statements and it really worked and I think ending this is great I think this is great I should be I should be proud of you Java anyways now we will see how we can play music and it is gonna be little tricky but believe me it'll be easy so I'll say LF play music in and I'll say query dot no one if query contains or rather instead of writing query dot lower quality don't know what I should have returned query don't know what that would have been even great but again you guys can do it I want you to do all the improvements I'm just giving you a bare minimum program and I want you to improve it as much as possible okay so I'll say a songs is equal to and I'll say oh s dot list dir OS is a module and list dir is a function inside that OS module it's a built-in module and you can use this module to list the directory content and I'll pass it the directory where I have my music I have my music in this directory you guys might have it in other directory it doesn't matter as long as you pass in the correct directory so we have songs as equal to OS Nautilus directory which will list all these songs and I will show you something if I print songs and I want javis to speak a little less for me I don't want it to speak initializing javis phone oh I just wanted to say good afternoon and I'll run it I have syntax error somewhere I'll see what it is so play music in query dot lower there is something wrong with the syntax songs is equal to this what is the error saying that unicorn escaped can't decode okay so I'll have to pass a double slash okay disable slash so when you're passing thoughts on window you'll have to escape them and you just have to give double slashes instead of single hey play music for me now obviously it's not gonna play music for me my little tell me what are the songs I have inside this directory so I've dolphin flames and song inside this territory but again I can always open these songs and I can say something like this so I'll say ok Oh a start start file and I'll say started by start by playing now playing this music or other songs and then I'll say songs zero and I'll say songs dir and I want to put it inside a variable so that I can pass it is equal to [Applause] this thing and let me see songs dir and then I'll say something like our song CI a song Co I think it should walk I'll run this program and I'll ask it to play music for me please play music for me javis alright it works Wow Wow it was it started playing music for me so this is great guys it has started a playing music for me I think I think this is great once again you can make it do some other tasks for you like you can ask it time so if I ask it what's the time so I'll say LF and I'll say something like time or three time in gray dot Lowell and I will say something like a string time is equal to and in order to take the time from the state time model you'll have to say a date time dot date time and then you'll have to say now and then you'll have to say STR F time and then you'll have to give it give it the format you want time in so I'll say H and in percentage M and then a percentage s how do I know I have to write this I know it from the documentation of this date/time module I want you guys to go to the documentation of date/time module read about this module and come back you'll have better understanding but once again if you want to run this project if you just want to implement something with what you have learned so far using this course through this playlist I want you guys to stick with me and let's let's proceed now I want you guys to make a Java speak this time for you so I want job is to say speak and I want you to say master the time is and then I wanted I wanted to say STR time let me see if it works good afternoon Jarvis what's the time wow it works it works guys it falls Thank You javis much appreciated thank you thanks a lot javis ok so we have this ready we have play music function we have a function - you know we have some code to ask javis about the current time we have done a lot of stuff here now we'll do one more thing that I am really fond of doing in fact this is something that I do daily and I'll say open code what is code a Visual Studio code I wanted to open visual studio code and in order to do that I'll say okay if this is inquiry dot lower and it should be really straightforward for you so I'll say footpath and I'll give it my code but how do I know my code path I will right-click my visual studio code and after right-clicking my visual studio code I will say more and then I'll say open file location' and after clicking on open file location' I'll say right-click and once again I just want to you know I just want to find out where this Visual Studio code is open file location' and it's here it opened it for me I'll copy this path I will paste it here and once again in order to escape these slashes I'll have to type them once again so double slash and I think this should work and once again I'll have to say code dot exe as well because code dot exe is the name of the application this is the path of the application I hope you got it now what I'll do is I'll say oh a start start file and code path and that's it this will open visual studio code but since I already have Visual Studio code open and it'll open another window for me so let's try this out I'll run this program and the last job is to open code for me hey Jarvis good afternoon it's open code for me all right it open code for me thank you so much Jarvis actually I don't need code because I already have my business video could open but again Jarvis is doing its work really nice and I really appreciate it so this is how you can make your Jarvis do bunch of stuff now we will upgrade this program little bit and we'll make it send emails yes you heard that right we'll make it send emails so what I'll do here is I'll write send email function and I'll say to content and then once again I'll say server is equal to and we have imported a model called SMT li b of SMT li b and i'm copying it from there and I will I'll say query is equal to sorry I was there wish me take command send him okay server is equal to I got confused for a while anyways server is equal to SMTP and IB and i'll say dot smtp and then I'll say smtp.gmail.com SMTP not PD SMTP and you guys must be thinking what am I writing here without explaining you guys and let me tell you this is SMTP Gmail server and it is open at port 587 so this is something that you need to write if you want to send emails through your Gmail account and then you'll have to say something like server dot e h l o and then once again you'll have to say server dot start TTLs and once again you'll have to login so you'll say server dot login and you'll have to write your email Cemal calm and once again before I tell you to do this I want you to give some warning typing your password inside a program and keeping it somewhere is really very dangerous I don't want you guys to do this but once again for educational purpose you can put your password here you can put your email id and you can put the password corresponding to that email id here this is not my email id this is not my password but if you put your email ID and password but it will not be unsafe as long as you have it inside your computer and as long as you delete it after after testing javis having said that you can write your email ID and password here and you can then do something like server dot send mail and you can send it to send it to anything against I Hadi add code with Harry calm and then you can do something like say to and content so this is a send mail function inside this server SMTP Li b dot SMTP object this is a function and we are using this function and really giving it the email ID we want the mail to and we are giving it the recipients email ID and the content we want us in and then we'll say server dot close all right it works so now as you can see I have this server door close here one thing I want you guys to do is go to once again I want to give you some warning before doing this this is really very unsafe issue you're running if you're using your primary account your primary gmail account your Google account I don't want you to do this but once again if you have a test account or if you want to do it temporarily you can do it so you can search for something like allow unsafe Apps Gmail and if you so extensively at something like allow less secure apps to access a gmail accounts and you can find an article from Google here where they have told you how to how to allow less secure apps to use your Google account and you should not do it once again you should use more secure apps you should always keep your password see if you should not enter your password anywhere on the internet and even in your person programs it's not safe but once again this is something which I am doing for educational purpose so you can write your password here you can and you can play around with this as long as you have everything safe you have your password inside your own computer then you can do this having said that you can go to you can sign into your account and then you will find some option to to enable less secure app someone you guys to read this article in fact you don't have to read this article you can turn on less secure app access and it's pretty straightforward I am not logged in that's why I'm not doing this once you do this on your gmail account which you have put here so if it's hairy at gmail.com I'll go to my hairy gmail.com and I will turn on like less secure apps and I will put my hairy at gmail.com password here and after doing that I will be able to use this then email function and mice and email function is there ready to use now once again how do I know that I have to write all this I went to the SMP tli B's documentation and I got the code from there I hope you understood what I am trying to explain here having said that will write another alef statement and will say something like a email to Harry cool if I say evil to Harry inquiry dot lower then what to do I'll say okay if email to Harry is there then we'll wrap everything inside try cast because sending email is something which might feel if you don't have stable internet connection or if you mess up with any of these steps that I explained you might get an exception and I want you guys to put it inside try-catch so we'll we'll try speak I will say what should I send so javis will say what should I send and then once again I'll say content is equal to P c'mon it'll t come on and let us say I want to send these are the videos that I want you to create Harry and I'll say the video titles now J as angular j s or whatever angular 8 whatever you whatever the case may be and once I'm done speaking it will store everything inside content variable and then I can use this content to pass through my send email function so I'll say two is equal to Harry at gmail.com gmail.com and once again send email and then once again I'll say answer to content and then I'll write speak email has been sent successfully and my email will be sent if I do this and once again if I get any exception I'll say accept exception as the Brendy I just want to print the exception if something wrong happens so that should do it let me run this program and let me see that send email to Harry hey job is send email to Harry just ask Harry to come over oh I said I asked her to come I said ask Harry to come work he said I asked her to come over ha ha ha leader is giving me analyze of now because the username and password are not correct but once again you can see that we are getting something from Google and it's showing us that you have your bad credential inside your variables you should update your credentials I want you guys to do this exercise I want you guys to put in your password and put in your email and then once again you have to go to the Internet you have to log into your Google account and you have to enable less secure apps but be aware to to Stacey if I've already given you a hat sub that you don't have to turn on save apps you don't have to do it with your primary account make sure to be safe before you perform all this and once again if you're using some program or some anything anything which is not safe which is not from a safe source never ever put your password inside that because it might take your credentials and it might attack you and you should also have your two factor authentication turned on if you are if your account is really very important if you have your bank account or if your gmail account is really very important to you if you're serious with your accounts you should always enable two-factor authentication so that was about Jarvis and this is something that you can extend as much as possible I will collapse these functions and I will also write a function deff main and I want to wrap everything inside a function so let me select all this and then you press tab so that I can wrap it inside the function main oops yeah now it's good and then I'll just run this main and after I done mean my Chaves will start asking me what you want to do hey job is play some music I'm really tired play music alright play the music for me so let it play the music in the meantime I think it's really very loud let me close this anyways let me close this as well so let me explain this program to you guys once again so we used by TDS x3 module we use speech recognition model vu state time Wikipedia web browser operating system which is an inbuilt module in SMTP Li B after importing all these modules we wrote a function called speak and we used our PI TDS X 3 module to complete or speak function which will do nothing but it'll pronounce the spring which is passed to it as it is now we have something called Rashmi function and we are detecting the hour and if for our is greater than equal to 0 and less than 12 we are saying good morning and according to the time we are saying good afternoon and good evening that's it and then we are making Java C hey how may I help you or something can change this text and you can make it C something else if you want then we have this take command function which will which will take command from your from your microphone and it'll convert it to a string and return it to you and if there is if something goes wrong it will you know it will return none to you and that's there's something that you will not see and you will see very less often if you have some problem with your microphone or if you are not speaking properly if you're far away from your microphone after that we wrote the send email function and it was something that I took from SMTP Li B's documentation we wrote our divert program wherein we wrote bunch of evil statements and we we gave some commands to it we searched for some words inside the command and we made her javis perform these tasks accordingly I hope you like this video if you did I want you guys to press thumbs up just smash that like button and if you haven't already access this playlist I've only guys to access this playlist because it's really important for you to go through these videos one by one if you haven't already I want you guys to watch the series of videos one video at a time and you will clear all your Python related concepts if you haven't already shared this video and you want to support me I want you guys to share this video and subscribe to the channel if you haven't already that's all for now guys so thank you so much guys for watching this video and I will see you next time [Music]
wwXFXuRETdY,in this video I'm going to be explaining you what lambda functions are and we'll see how to use them and make our Python programs more and more efficient so what I'm gonna be doing is I will be opening my Python tutorial series and I want you guys to access that so that you have access to all the videos that I'm creating it also make sure to bookmark this playlist and save this playlist for yourself now I'll be coming to visual studio code and I will create a new file and let me call it tutorial 32 . p pi so what I'm gonna be doing is I'll be opening a new file I'll say if you tour real 32 dot py and let me write some code inside this tutorial that I do not py so what I'm gonna be doing is I'll say print and then I will say hello word and I'll ctrl s to save and I will run this and you'll see that I have this print hello world which means that my program is working fine so I already told you about functions and you must now be knowing that if I have print n function and let me say I have the value N and if I say for I in range n I can say something like print and I can say st RI ng where string is some random string that I want to print n times and if I write let me see if I write print and and I can use this function and I can say something like let me say Harry and I'll say something like 56 is too large of a number I'll say 5 and if I run this you'll see that Harry is printed 5 times so this is a normal function and we have already talked about this function but what is the lambda function let us say I want to create a function and I want to multiply two numbers so what I'll do is I'll say mul is equal to ay multiplied by B and I'll say something like a return month but I can do something else and I can do better in terms of number of lines of code so if I say something like multiply and I say 5 and 4 and let me assign it to a variable and we'll say something like princey and you'll see 20 on your screen no surprises a Hello word 20 and multiply function ran when I executed it for five and four but can I do something else yes I can and this is what lambda functions are so what I'll do is I'll zoom in a bit and close the Explorer and I will write multiply function and already for multiplier function in fewer lines of code so I can say something like multiply is equal to lambda so lambda is a keyboard as you can see it changed its color to blue and now I can pass the arguments that will take I'll say a and B and then write a colon and I will give the return value so I want to return a multiply by B so this is a one-liner within I created a function whose name is multiply and which will get a and B as input and will written a multiplied by B so these kind of simple functions can be written in one line using lambda function but let us see whether they work or not so what I'll do is I'll I can run my program and you can see that I have this 20 printed which means that my multiplier function is working as expected so this is how lambda functions work but you might be thinking you're ready to use lambda functions so and why are they handy well the correct answer to this question and the correct explanation of this question will come with practice when you'll go to different repositories you will start working on open source projects and you will start exploring more of Python but again lambda function is something that you should know exist in Python I'll also write here while lambda functions are also called so let me write lambda functions functions or anonymous functions so lambda functions are also called anonymous functions if you don't know about it and I'll just write ctrl s to save and print that is a function I just wanted to show you some function so I wrote print and if you are not using it whatsoever and we wrote multiply function in three lines of code we could have done the same thing in one line and for that we use lambda functions now you might be thinking can we pass multiple arguments and can we do something complex here so for it an A P ay multiplied by B plus five I can do that as well so the answer to this the output of this program will be 5 multiplied by 4 plus 5 which is 25 so you can perform as many operations as you want and you can even supply multiple inputs so if I have ABCD and I have a multiply by B multiplied by C multiplied by D I can supply something like this - and - once again ctrl s to save 5 multiplied by 4 is 20 and 20 multiplied by four is 80 so I should see 80 on my output window as you can see then I have this ad printed on my output window so I can supply multiple inputs to my lambda function and I will get multiple outputs as specified in return so this is how lambda functions work one of the most asked questions from Python programmers is that why you slammed a function the correct explanation to this question will be given to you by yourself and you practice more and more but let me give you a little taste of when you should use lambda functions so let us say you want to return a function from a function or you want to supply function as input to some other function in those cases you can use lambda functions but again if this is not clear to you that's totally fine for this video I want you guys to understand that there is something called lambda functions in Python and you can specify multiple inputs and you can have whatever you want as output in terms of input so if you want to evaluate a simple function or you want to add two numbers multiply two numbers divide two numbers you can use this syntax and the return value of lambda function is a function and it should be used like this just like other functions so you create a function first and then you use that function and just like a normal function so this is how lambda functions work I hope this is clear to you and you will definitely understand more of lambda functions when you practice more and more I want you guys to access this playlist as soon as possible if you haven't already and also let me know how this course is going I want you guys to write some comments for me and I will definitely read your comment in fact I need all the comments so I'll be giving you love on your comments if you write me awesome comments don't forget to access this playlist and bookmark it for yourself make sure to LIKE this video guys thank you so much for watching this video and I will see you next time [Music]

u0BA_nM1hSc,So hi guys I'm with Sumeda who is head of and the third security goes without saying nice
TXDWEwffQNw,alright guys so it's time for us to solve and the exercise that I gave you in my Python course so let me open these Python tutorials and I want all of you guys to access the playlist that I gave you so we'll see how many people solve this problem and before that I'm gonna be solving this problem for you so what I'm gonna be doing is I'll sort it by newest first so that you can see the latest comments at the very top and I'll be coming from the very bottom so I don't see any solution but yeah again I'll be solving the exercise first and then we will move towards T solvers and we'll give them shout out so as you can see that the exercise is about guessing the numbers so what we have to do is we'll say actual number so we have something called actual number and let us say it is 45 I'm just taking the number that I gave you in the initial question now what you have to do is you will have to guess it and you'll have to keep guessing on a loop so what I'll do is I'll use a while loop I'll say a while and also while guess let me say while true and I'll use break there are a number of ways to solve exactly the same problem and I am gonna be using this while true so what I'll do is I'll say ok number of attempts you took attempts is equal to 0 and attempt so when you are entering this while loop and say ok you have used one of your attempts I'll increment the attempts counter by 1 I'll say ok so now you have used one of your attempt and you guess the number so I'll say guess is equal to I'll say input and guess the number and I'll use back solution just to make things look good let me remove this space and after that in fact before that I'll be using int and I have already discussed this in great detail in my Python course if you haven't already accessed the playlist I want you guys to access the playlist and watch the videos from the very beginning coming back to the visual studio code I'm gonna be saying ok so this is your guess I'll say if your guess is less than the actual number so if it guess is less than the actual number I'll say your gas falls too low and what I'll do is I'll say ok if your guess was too low then just event control Z controllers I'll say L if if your guess is greater than the actual number and will say your guess was too high because you have guessed a number which is higher than the actual number now what I'll do is I'll say ok if none of these conditions are true I'll say I'll use an app's finger you solved not solved you guessed the number in and I'll say attempts these number of attempts so attempts is a variable and the value of atoms keep on increasing as we keep on entering the loop this is a while true loop and once we have won the game we'll say ok it's time to break now so I'll say break and our program will stop then I think I did not print anything but again I just to show you guys that we have exited the loop I'll say thanks for playing ctrl s to save and let me see how this program works and guess the number 78 I guess was too high 54 you guess was too high once again for you guess was too low I'll say ok let me try 30 your guess was too low which means 35 might work you guess was too low again so I'll say 40 and I know the number I know the exact number it is 45 so if I enter 45 right away it will tell me that you have guessed the number and in a single attempt now again you can use if statements to correct the grammar here but I'm not focusing much on that so this is how you solve this problem this a very straightforward simple problem on on taking input from the user and on if else statements so what I'll do now is I'll create a separate file for this one so I'll say tutorial RI al and I'll say 29 dot P Y and we'll copy the entire code let me copy the entire code to this file because I want to keep things well organized so let me remove the solution from here because this is the question and you will be getting this code at the description so that's about it guys I'll be giving you shout out now so let me go back to the video page and how many people solve this problem when we count 1 2 3 4 5 0 10 people solve this problem so moose can go sky network a metallic and camper sky network rohan das monal gajjar shankar dance anna anna rock shock here yeah Ajith SM and I see the code from Anna rock shock here and I think he has done it right he has done exactly the same thing that I have done so kudos to him great a great interruption kiting your code will work because I can see it this is correct so he has actually separated the code and written an insider function and I really appreciate it so big shout out to Anurag and I can't see any other solution I want you guys to solve the problem and I'll be giving you shelter so that's for the video guys thank you so much for watching this video make sure to hit the like button and access the playlist bookmark it save it and I will see you next time [Music]
x4Rt-6lg1d0,I guess it's time for you guys to solve an exercise and I'm gonna be giving you an exercise if you haven't already access this playlist I want you guys to access this playlist and bookmark it and keep it safe now I'll tell you what is the question for today's exercise let me create a new file and we call it tutorial 28 dot py and after calling it tutorial 28 dot py what I'm gonna be doing is I'm gonna be writing here exercise 3 because this is third exercise and the name of this exercise is and guess the number so let me tell you what you guys have to do in this exercise you have to guess a number and a computer will tell you whether the number you guessed is greater than the actual number or it is less than the actual demo let me clear this off a little bit more so if I say actual number is equal to 45 let us say your actual number is 45 so assuming the actual number is 45 and you guessed let me say 5 your computer will tell you you guessed your guess was too low and lesser than you assumed the number to be 50 it will tell you that your gas was too large and then it will keep on telling you whether your guess was lower than the actual number or larger than the actual number and if you keep on doing this until you reach the actual number and once you reach the actual number you will get a prompt for the computer that you guessed the number correctly in let us say five attempts or nine attempts or 13 attempts so let me write the problem statement for you once again you have to guess a number and you have to guess any given number you'll have to store that number so I'll add store a number store a number in a variable variable you have to guess that number let me say store any number in a variable you have to guess that number so your program you'd be able to tell whether the number you guessed was lesser or greater than the actual number so let me complete it off by us adding you have to finally tell the number of attempts it took the guesser to guess the number let me ctrl s to save it and now you can start writing the code before attempting this problem I want you all of you guys to write challenge accepted in the comment section down below that we all know that you want to solve this problem and I'm gonna be getting a solution from you guys so I'll wait for your solution and make sure to access the playlist because I'll be adding more and more videos to this playlist also make sure to LIKE this video thank you so much guys for watching this video and I will see you next time [Music]

7g6mQnpOxgE,alright guys so the most asked question from Python programmers is what are escape sequences so what I'm gonna be doing here is I will create a new file tutorial 25 dot py and I'm gonna be showing you what escape sequence characters are so let us say you have something like print and you want to say hello what's up now if you have to say something like this you can easily do that so you can and use hello what's up and you can use single code inside your a double quote string and you will have this hello what's up printed on your output window but what if you have this didn't like this and you want to use single quote your ipython interpreter will get confused and or what you'll get is an error it'll say that what is this I don't know what is this or let us say you are using a double quote string and you want to use a double cut character here once again your Python interpreter will get confused so and the solution to this is escape sequence characters and escape sequence characters are special characters that you can use along with a backslash so if I have backslash and double quote then this is an escape sequence character and this is essentially telling my Python interpreter that this is a single character this is an escape sequence and I want this to be replaced with the proper double code I don't know I don't mean to end the string by writing this so let me run this program and you'll see hello what's up again if you want to write a single quote here you can do that because you already have the entire string enclosed in double quotes but what you can also do is you can use a couple of other escape sequence characters for example let us say what if you want to use a backslash you want to say hello and you want to use a backslash so if you write a single backslash like this or like this for that matter it will assume that you mean backslash T and backslash T is an escape sequence character which means a tab so this will again give you an error if your syntax is not at place so what I'll do here now is I will write all the escape sequences here and then I want you guys to try them out so backslash T is a tab and then not tab panel it's tab and then backslash n is a newline now I don't expect you guys to remember each and every escape sequence character but again you should have you should know the most important ones so this is a single quote and then again if you want to use an escape double quote it looks like this and there are a couple of other escape sequences as well but but I'm not gonna be discussing all of them what I'll do is I'll comment these out and what I'll do here is I'll say okay I want to use a backslash here so I'll say backslash backslash backslash backslash is interpreted as a single backslash so if I run this program I'll get a single backslash here now I have a double quote here what if I write backslash n here I'll get a line break as you can see I have a line break here and if I write backslash T then I have a tab here as you can see in the output window so this is how escape sequence characters work in Python also you can use as many escape sequences as you want once again so escape sequence character is a single character that is that starts with a backslash and this is interpreted as a single character and you have to use a backslash to escape certain characters to let your Python know that you mean a literal double quote instead of the string ending also what I want you guys to do is go to google and search for Python but then as keep sequence characters and you'll get a bunch of them I want you guys to look into the results and you will get few more escape sequence characters also if you haven't already axe displaylist I want you guys to access this playlist and bookmark it safely so that you have all the videos available to watch anytime also you can click on this save playlist button to save this playlist also you can create a new playlist as you complete the videos whatever you want to do I want you guys to leverage this course and understand each and every concept from all the videos so that's it for this video guys make sure to give me a thumbs up thank you so much guys for watching this video and I will see you next time [Music]
4vsW0LimYh8,alright guys so in this video I'm gonna be explaining you what short and if-else notation is and how you can use shorthand if else notation to make your code compact so what I'm actually gonna be doing is I'm gonna be opening my Python playlist and I want you guys to access this playlist if you haven't already because I am gonna be adding all the videos to this playlist and if you have not access the playlist yet I think you are missing on something so what I'll do is I'll open a new file so what I'll say is once a tutorial 24 dot py and inside tutorial 24 that py I'll create two variables so I'll say E is equal to 45 and I'll say B is equal to 56 so these are the two variables that I have created and what I'll do is I want to create a variable C which will be equal to this sum if a is greater than B let us let us say let us say that it is equal to the difference of these two numbers and we don't need a negative difference so it means that if a is greater than B I want to say C is equal to a minus B but if he is not less than B what I want is I want C is equal to B minus a so in all the cases my C is gonna be positive and what I'll do is I'll say I only use an AB string here I'll say the value of the difference between the difference and I'll say ah see so I've written let me remove these blank lines what I'll do is I'll count the number of lines that I wrote to write this program one two three four five six seven so we have seven lines to get this done and the value of C is gonna be a B minus a for this case and it is eleven for sure so it's 11 whatever make it six then I'll get 39 because in this case now it's gonna be doing a minus B so nothing news so far now what I'm gonna be telling you is that you can do this in single line of code you don't have to write these many lines of code and for that we have ternary operator which can also be written as a nested if-else but I'm gonna be writing a very simple offense so what I'll say is all this is useless all you have to do is C is equal to a minus B and C is equal to a minus B if if a is greater than B else C is equal to what LC is equal to B minus a you just saying ctrl s to save run your program and you are gonna be seeing the same result that you were seeing before so this is the shorthand if-else notation let me say short and if-else notation and this is also called ternary operator so this is something that I wanted to talk to you about now if you haven't already accessed the playlist I want you guys to do it right away and bookmark it safely so that you have it at your disposal anytime you want to revise something or anything you want to see some concept for example if you don't know what string slicing is or you have already watched the video but you are not confident on how to do the slicing you can always watch this video once again so you can do that if you have your course playlist bookmark I want you to do that also I want to give you a quick quiz I want you to use more than one statement using ternary operator and try to experiment that now I want to mention something here and it is that you can always use ternary operators but the thing is that if you have a lot of conditions if your code is little complicated then I discourage the use of ternary operators because anyway you are not getting any advantage computationally but you are you are compromising on the readability of the code so I don't want you to compromise the readability because that is the most important thing so what you have to do is you have to see if the use case is pretty simple if you can write something in single line of code you would not want to complicate things by splitting it into 1 2 3 4 lines of code on the other hand if you have some logic going on some complex thing being computed I want you guys to completely write the if condition followed by the elephant else condition so I hope you now understand what short and if-else notation is and you can easily use it in your Python programs so guys make sure to LIKE this video if you haven't already thank you so much guys for watching this video and I will see you next time [Music]
63oykCokNak,guess so far in this course I have told you about a lot of things in this video we are gonna touch upon a very important concept as far as python is concerned and as far as file handling in python is concerned we're gonna be looking into how to handle files in python so what I'm gonna be doing now is I am gonna be creating a new file here and I will say tutorial and let me call it her 26 it is 26 tutorials in it tutorial 26 dot P Y and I will have this new file open so in this video we'll talk about file handling and what file handling is is something which is important so what I'll do is I'll say file handling is working with file programmatically using Python so we'll see how to read files we will see how to create a file we'll see how to update files and we will see how to delete a file in Python so what I'm gonna be doing is I'm gonna be starting with this open function and what I'll do is I simply say let me call it first file dot txt and I'll say F is equal to open first file dot txt so what it's gonna do is it's gonna open first file dot txt for reading so let me create this file here so I'll say first file dot txt and what I'm gonna be doing is I'll say this is my first file which I will be using in tutorial 26 of Python course at programming with Harry so what I'll do is I'll simply go back to my program and I am gonna be explaining you how to read content of a file so what I'll do is I'll simply say F is equal to open first file dot txt and I'll simply say F dot read and I'm gonna be assigning it to a variable I will say content is equal to F dot read and I'll say contend and if I run this program you will see that I have activating extensions prompt here and first time we open a file it actually takes a lot of time I don't know why for some reason if I have this Visual Studio code already open and I am already working with couple of Python files I'll not be seeing this error not at all not be seeing this delay anyways we are here and we have seen the output this is my first file which is the content of the file first file dot txt so I have the content of my file here however this is still incomplete program and I will tell you what what is the thing that is making it incomplete so before that let me close this one and let me comment each of these steps we took to open this file so I'll say create a file pointer then I'll say read the content contents of the file and also print the contents of the file so I'll say print the content of the file so whatever is contained in the file will be displayed and it will be assigned to the content variable and you can always print it but I'm saying that this is still incomplete because whenever you open a file you should always say F dot close to close the file and this is really a very good practice and you should adhere to this practice this is because you you will come up with a lot of scenarios ability where you will have to play around with a lot of files and I don't want you to open the file and leave it open I want you guys to close it using this close function now this program is a perfect program to read content of a file and print it on the output screen so if I run this program you will see this is my first file and I will be using that I which I'll be using in tutorial 26 of Python code programming with Harry so if I need a bunch of new lines here and if I press ctrl s and I run this program once again you'll see these new lines appear in the output window so this is how pretty much it works by again when you say f is equal to open first file dot txt and you just specified the name of the file and and you simply read the content of the file so this was the bare minimum program I'm going to be telling you about one more thing which is second argument of open function and by default the second argument is a read as text so I'll get back to this once I explain you what kind of mores we have while opening a file so if I say R it means that I want to open this file for reading if I say a it means that I want to open this file for appending which means adding okand into the file if i say right it means that i just want to write i want to start afresh and i want to write to this file and if I say X then it creates the file and it returns an error if that file exists already so we'll see all these moods one by one so first mode is pretty clear if I say our first mode is pretty clear I have already explained you about this but if I talk about the right mode and if I say half is equal to open this and I'm opening it as right so let me do one thing let me again press alt and let me bring this line down and let me close this one as well and this is a bare minimum program where many mum program to open a file I'll simply comment this one ctrl s to save and a lot of the comments is because I don't want to see my console cluttered so what I'll do is I'll say ok half is equal to open this for writing it creates a file pointer and it felt right you will try to write to that file and I will show you how to write so what you can do is you can use this write function you can say after try it and you can say it's ok so if I press backspace if I open this it is telling me that write function will accept a text variable which is a string and this will write this string to the file so if I say this is a good boy kinda let's just save and I have not closed too close and if I run this program it will simply read the content of the first file and then it will ride this is a good boy to this file so if I open this file here you will see this is a good boy so this is how you write to a file again we can talk about other two modes if I say II okay so if I run this program once again all over again you'll see that first file is this is a good boy and the previous content has been cleared up so when I say right I start over and write to the file I don't append to the end of the contents and that is already there in the file so what I'll do here is I will simply put on this program once again but now with the append mode I will say a and what this will do is it will add more content to whatever the file contains so if I keep running this program you'll see that this is a good boy this is a good boy this is a good boy will be concatenated again and again and again as long as I press this Run button to run this program so if I run it ten times this is a good boy will be concatenated ten times and I don't want to do that so this is how open mode works now you know what hapenned mode is I'll tell you about bunch of modes that we discussed modes of opening a file and I'll simply say the first mode is the read mode and this is pretty clear and you can specify R as the second argument to the right function second function second mode is the append mode and I'll simply say a and this will add content to the end of the file and this will this will simply read the content of the file and we have we have a right mode and this will simply I should have mentioned right mode first but again I know you guys are smart enough to figure that out that we write to a file and then we append you can always use append mode but if you use append mode it will keep on appending to the end of the file so this is how it works right content to the to the file to the file so it's like clears the file clears the content of the file and writes turned into the file and we have the last one which is nothing but create mode and you can use X for create word and what this will do is it will create the file and return error if that pile already already exists okay ctrl s to save and you will have to select it and comment it because we don't want to see errors this this will technically throw an error if I do not comment this one so what I'll do now is I'll simply in this program once again to show you guys that it works if I see capital this is a good boy and if I add backslash N and O let's save and if I clear this file so I'll say ok my file contains nothing ok and if I keep on running this program 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 ok so we have done it plenty of times and you'll see that 20 lines have been printed here so we simply said to our Python interpreter hey python interpreter we want to add this is a good boy and a newline character to the end of this file my python interpreter will say all right Harry let me do that for you so it'll go to the file open the file it will add this string then I've given to the write function to the end of the file and we'll keep on doing that until I keep running this program so I hope this is clear and you are now clear with the four moods I discuss about so we have read mode we have a pen mode we have write more and we have create mode so this is something I wanted to talk to you about now again you can always say a 8d and by saying it you are saying that I want this file to be handled as a txt now if you say a B you are saying that I want this file to be handled as a binary file so you can specify T and B in the second argument but you not use the binary mode most of the times but again I have wanted to tell you so let me write it here so if we add T or B to the end of the second argument we can specify whether we want to whether we want to open the file as a text file or binary file respectively so if we add T this character or disconnected to the end of the second argument we can specify whether we want to open the file as a text file or a binary file so I will simply give you an example example sorry so f open this dot txt a B will open in append mood as pilot so I want to give you enough example so that you don't face any problem while running the code and I want you guys to practice as much as you guys can so I hope this cleared the basics of file i/o and now you'll be able to handle files in Python so what I want you guys to do is go to my channel and I this plane is

P--ajCoYFiM,in this video I'm gonna be explaining you what try/except exception handling in python is and how to catch errors in Python now what I mean by catching errors I'm gonna be showing you in just a moment so let me create a new file here I'll say tutorial 22 dot py and let me close this previous file I will close this Explorer make myself some more space and I will write try catch in in fact it's try/except so if you are coming from a language like C or C++ it is catch there so try except exception handling in Python now why use try except exception handling what does it mean let me explain you something so let us say you have this Python script you have line number 1 you have line number 2 line number 1 was some import statements in fact let me call it block so block is collection of lines so let us say block number 1 might have first four lines and the next four lines are there in block number two and let us say we have some let me say some calculations inside my block number two and then block number three is reaching the internet and it's pulling some data from the server so let us say it's pulling some data and then and then block number four block number four returns the result let us say it returns a result to the end user to tell that whether the data pull was successful or not now consider a case let me make it block number five and I'll make it block number four and block number four will be perform data pre-processing so I will say perform data pre-processing and this is return return the result so we have five blocks in a Python script in the first block we have some port statements and then in the second block we have some calculations then we have some data pool in block number three block number four is the data pre-processing pre-processing of the data that we pulled in step number three and then finally in step number five we are returning the result which means you have printed it on the screen or may be writing to the database whatever the case may be now what I'm going to do is I'm going to comment these lines because these lines are not valid Python syntax now let us say you're you have an active internet connection your Wi-Fi works fine you will have your block number one executed successfully block number two will also get successful then block number three is pulling some data from the internet and you do not have your internet connection at place so what will happen is this will fail and your program will throw some error now since your program threw some error in block number three you cannot reach block number four and you cannot reach block number five which means that the result is not returned in block number five but what I would like to rather do is I would like to throw the error to the user in fact I'll tell the user that hey there was something wrong with the connection and we were not able to pull the data in step number three which is the reason we were not able to pre-process it in step number four and hence we are giving you this message in step number five but if you do not have your error handling at place your block number three will fail it will throw some error and your script will stop working let me give you an example so let us say I have something like a is equal to five and then I have V is equal to int input I'm taking input from the user I'll say enter B and I'm giving you a very simple example now this is a real word scenario that you might encounter if you are working on a real word problem but I'm giving you a very simple example when I am saying is equal to five and then B is equal to int input and a B and then you will have something like C is equal to let me say a plus B and then what I'll do is let us say I am saying if if something which fails and that is why it's false and do something else this D is equal to six and then again I say print D but since this was false and it did not reach hair or let me say server data server data is equal to false let us say it returns false for some reason and you have f server data D is equal to 6 and you are printing D here and now you are saying print success if I run this program here it will run it'll ask me the value of B I'll say 4 but here it's saying name D is not defined because server data returns false which is the reason D is equal to 6 is not executed my line number 15 is not executed because my line number 14 contains an if statement which is false so I cannot come here to line number 16 and have my Python program executed successfully because I do not have the value of D it's saying that the MD is not defined since I don't have D defined here I cannot use it I cannot print it and it will throw some error so how to fix this problem now you might be thinking how do you have hard-coded this server data as false why haven't you given it some true or some other value and it will go through so if I give it some value which is true then it will go through I'll show you so if I run it and I say B is equal to 5 and it will say 6 and success so when a programmer is programming the worst thing he can do is to only consider positive scenarios a true programmer is a programmer who will consider all negative scenarios as well so what if server data fails what if server fails what if my internet connection breaks what if the data is not there in order on the server so let me write a comment here I'll say server data returns true if or rather server data returns true I'll say only if data pool is successful so I'll comment this out and somebody that will return true only if data pool is successful successful and it will return false otherwise so if rate returns false then I will have my program through some error so how to fix this problem so what I'll do is I'll say ok whatever the case may be you would have on the server data returns just try this so I'll say try I say just try this and if this goes through it means that B was successful but if it doesn't then you see except exception sorry it has to be capital exception oops this one as E and I'll say print e and it will print exception for me so what I'll do here is I'll say F string and say it failed because of this error and I'll say ye let me remove this from here and it will print it fail because of this error and if I run this program you will see that server data is false it lasts me for B and it will go through but again it will tell me that this was the error which occurred which means my program is not throwing any error but it is telling me that it failed because of this error and anything after this anything so if I say print some more lines will be executed so this will be executed because this was not an error this was a print statement this is a result of print statement it is not error so if you want to see the error it looks like it looks like this let me show you let me write if one for the time being here so it looks something like this namely is not defined name error trace back so this is an error but if I put my try and hi and commend this accept and if I run this program you'll see that I will have it filled because of this error name D is not defined and I have this some more lines executed I have line number of 25 executed because I have caught this error in case you do not have try except at place you will not see this some more lines here because your program is terminated a right on the line where it sees an error so if you program encounters an error you will be halted there you will not be able to process the further lines from your program so this is how you can catch errors from your program now what if what if it was true what if everything was good if everything was good it will try it and it will go through so it will successfully print if so our data is equal to 6 in an apparent success and then it will print some more lines but in case you see some error without try except this will not be printed now this can be some more lines I have just given an example by writing one line here so now you know why we used try accept so I will be summarizing this thing here so what I'll do is I will come back to the program at the top of the program I gave you an example wherein I told you that we have five blocks in a Python script the first block is a set of import statements the second block is some set of calculations the third block is pulling some data from some data store it can be some database but it has to use internet this is the stuff which might fail if you do not have a stable internet connection so block number 4 and dock number 5 will only be executed if you do not have an error in your block number three if block number three throw some error it will end your Python script here itself in block number four and block number five will not be executed which means the end user will not be able to see return the result step of this program but we want our end user to see the result of this program so what we'll do is we'll try step number three we'll say try this and in case you see some error go to except block and through the exception but do not stop the program do not allow the program to throw the error so it will say okay a is equal to five B is equal to input taken from the user C is equal to a plus B and then server data some some script to pull data from the server which will update server data variable server data will be true if you are able to successfully pull data from the server but it will be false otherwise so if you have server data head it will go through and it will initialize D is equal to six but in case server data is false it will not be able to define D and you will get an error here it will say print D what do you mean by print D I do not know what D is so it will throw you an error but since this thing is packed inside a try block it will say wait we cannot allow this program to throw an error because it is protected by a try statement so what will rather do is that since these set of lines are protected by this try block we good the except block and we threw the exception but will not throw the error we'll just do what our except block tells us to do so except block C is that okay you print this thing and then print the error here so it'll say it failed because of this error and we'll throw the error whatever the value of e is it was d is not defined in this case so it printed it failed because of this error and it printed D is not defined in place of E and then your program will keep on executing as usual so now you know how try and accept works I hope this gave you enough information about try and X now you'll be able to use try and accept in your programs I hope you're liking these series of videos and you're learning Python with me in case you have any doubt and in case you think I can do better make sure give me some suggestions in the comment sections below and thank you for all the thumbs ups that you are hitting on these videos make sure to hit thumbs up on this video as well I'll greatly appreciate it thank you so much guys for watching this video make sure to access this playlist and bookmark it and I will see you next time [Music]
wNXjVjRT8Ec,because I've given you an exercise in video number it was 60 I guess yes no it was video number 18 I had given you an exercise and in this video I'm gonna be reviewing all these questions that you have answered from exercise number two twinkle twinkle little star so what I'll do is I'll go to this video and I'm gonna be sorting all the comments by newest first and I will be getting newest comment first okay so what I'll do here is I'll be looking into each and every solution and I'm going to be giving you in fact I'm gonna be reviewing your solution okay so let me create a new file here I will call it tutorial twenty-three dot py it's a Python file and let me close the Explorer and what I'll do is I will I will first solve the problem and I will see what the problem was it was there in tutorial seventeen dot py let me close this and here it is so what is a function and then great name alright so it was not in tutorial number seventeen it seems it was there in general number eighteen so let me open T totally teen dot py so I will see the question and I will be attempting this question let's write the code so wrinkled analysts are you have to put in the following stop acting given the number of lines so what you have to do the first thing is that you have to take number of lines as an input and it should be an integer so let me do one thing I'll copy this and I will paste it into my tutorial twenty-three dot py let me paste it a let me close the Explorer I will comment this one as well otherwise I'll be getting a syntax error so what I'll do is I'll say ok let me comment this one as well I will say number of lines is equal to I will copy this and I will say int input and why did I say int I wrote this in because the output the return value of input is a string and we want to typecast it into a 90 so I'll say enter the number of lines you want backslash n backslash n is nothing but but an escape sequence character which is a newline now you said let us say 5 lines 1 2 3 4 5 I want to see this pattern so what I'll do is I'll say ok for I in range and range function essentially is used to produce numbers from 0 to the number you give it as an argument so let us say I give it seven as the argument I'll say range 7 it will give me 0 to 6 it will be iterating through the range 7 and what I'll be getting is 0 1 2 3 4 5 and 6 so what I'll do is I'll say print I I'll ctrl s to save and what I'm going to be doing is I will say number of lines is equal to this and I will be saying number of lines so let me say number of flies let me ctrl s to save I just want to see the values of I that I'm getting so this is not the final answer when I just want to see the values of I I will be getting so it is activating the extensions it will take some times first time you run so you'll have to be little patient so I'm waiting for it and it will come on visual studio code it is taking some time we don't know for some reason but let me tell you what the outputs gonna be it will be 0 1 2 3 4 initially it will ask me in the number of lines if I give 5 it will be 0 2 4 so you can see it's 0 to 4 so what I will actually do is I will say ok print star one time then two times and three times four times five times so what I'll do is I'll in-state print i plus 1 so what I'm gonna be seeing here is if I enter 5 I'll see 1 0 5 let me press enter and you can see I have 1 2 3 4 5 now instead of 1 2 3 4 5 I want to see number of starts so what I'm gonna be doing is all say star and then I'll say x I plus 1 star multiplied by a plus 1 and if I run it and if I say 5 not here I should write it here boom the problem is solved so how did I do that so what I did was I said okay print this string these number of times so it will print star one time then it will print star two times then three times in four times then five times so what I essentially did was I printed this star one time then two time three four five now there can be some shortcuts to solve this problem I know people have solved it in different ways so let's go to the video comments section and let us see how people have solved it so let's start with learn to do solution so what here's actually done is he has said okay for I in oh you have used two for loops buddy you don't have to use two for loops you can actually do it using a single for loop as well so let me copy a solution here and what I'll do is I'll just try to run it here and then I will save this and I'll run it and let me also write exit here so what exit does in Python is it will halt your program here and whatever is there after this exit line will not be executed so I'm writing this just to test out your solution so let me run this and it is asking for number of lines I'll say five oh man it did not work out for me so actually your solution is wrong and I would like you to go through this video and see how I have attempted it so better the next time buddy and it is always better to attempt and fail than not to attempt so I appreciate your effort learnt to do then he has again he has again given a solution and he has said one to six but he was supposed to give give the variable name where you have taken the input so ions you watch this video and you will definitely learn it now sky network I'll copy this I will paste a solution and what he has essentially done is he has taken the input and then he has come up with some logic and I am getting in addition error let he fixed this first let me run it and sing the line and starvin on five and it works but why are you printing this back solution here I don't know so what I'll do is I'll again run this program and I'll say five and again it is not working and let me see why it is not working you don't have to use this n is equal to plank and let me run it and it might not work again so I think I'll have to analyze the solution what kind of strategy you have thought of while solving this problem so what you did was you used two while loops and try to solve the problem but again it was pretty straightforward and I want you to watch the solution and come up with a simple solution next time so I appreciate your efforts sky network now understand I understand one-liner remarks so I cannot fill the comment buddy but I would love to give my thoughts I already said that there are one-liners possible but again you don't have to use one-liner all the times because sometimes they might get confusing as well so what I'll do is I'll paste your one-liner here and I will run this program and you can see that and the number of lines I'll put 5 and you have solved it pretty well so for I in range 1 2 you are given for I in range 1 to something and you have said ok print I multiply but this so I know that this is a one-liner and it is a good one but again you don't have to go for one-liner all the time because it reduces code readability sometimes in this case it is reducing code readability for me but again I would like to give you a big thumbs up I understand how whatever your name is I hope it's not I understand but I appreciate your efforts now again we have another solution from game series coming here and let me copy this and I'll paste it here and I'll just remove this I'll save my program and I will run it and it gives me syntax error I think you mean : by semicolon I will again run this and it should go through 5 oh man this is not working so this is the wrong pattern propria printed so i want you to watch the solution that I have discussed at the starting of this video the one that says I will do it tomorrow for sure sure buddy I'll wait for your solution then we have a solution from es and this is the code from es let me copy this code and let me paste it here let me I'll run this code and let me also let us know another number for string pattern let me say 4 and it does a big thumbs up to you buddy let me look at the strategy you have used to solve it so what you are essentially doing is you are saying a number of line is equal to distance and definite and then you are using a function and this is something I really appreciate that you have used a function to solve this problem so next time you want to solve this problem I mean you want to print this top pattern next you will be having a function at your disposal and it will be really convenient for you to run that function with the correct arguments and you will be carrying the patterns so I think this is the best solution so far and I really appreciate all the guys who have given your solution as comment greatly appreciated and I am adding more and more videos to this Python playlist so I want you to access is placed as soon as possible as well as bookmark it so that you don't lose it also again I will be giving you some more exercises and I want you guys so solve those exercises when I give them so that's it for now and we'll be discussing more of Python concepts in the subsequent videos so thank you so much guys for watching this video make sure to give me a big thumbs up and I will see you next time [Music]
8mM-oY2OD0k,alright guys so in this video I'm gonna be explaining you what a module in Python is and why use modules in Python so module is one of those things of Python that makes pythons unique powerful and we'll see how it makes it powerful so now I'm gonna be telling you how to use modules and brightness so let us make a new file here I will click here and I will type tutorial xx dot py and this will create a new file tutorial xx dot py and now what I'm gonna be doing is I'll close this Explorer and I will say import something so import is a keyword that is used to import some external code in Python now what is the module is the question so let me remove this and answer this question first so I'll say what is a module in Python so it is a model in Python module is an object that can extend the functionality of a Python code now what does it mean it means that you can bring in somebody else's code the code that is written by somebody else into your program and you can leverage what has already been done by him so how cool is that so let us say you don't know how to contact your operating systems kernel in order to make certain actions but somebody else has already written the code to do that so what you can do is you can import that module and you can use the specific function from that module to do this now how does this work and what does this mean and let me tell you in detail so what I'll do is I'll simply go to Google and I'll simply say Python built-in modules so this is a Google search that I'm making and you will see something called Python module index and it'll show you the list of built-in modules in Python the module is something that extends functionality and I'm gonna be giving you a very simple example by using math module so import is the keyword that is used to import any external module in Python so let us say I read import math and now I can use the functions from math module in my Python code so I can say something like a is equal to minus eight and I can say print math dot oh let me same instead of minus eight let me say eight point four five and I can say math dot floor and I can say a and if I print it will give me the floor value which is eight now if you want to calculate floor of a number of any decimal number you'll have to write the logic to do that you'll have to come up with some offense conditions but that has already been done inside the math module you have a function called floor and you can leverage the functionality there are many other functions as well for example there is something called Sealy and this gives a seal of a number and this is 9 because 8.45 after that comes 9 and before it 0.45 the least integer before that is 8 so the values of floor and Sela printed accordingly now the million dollar question is do I have to remember what functions are contained in which module and do I have to remember which function is doing what and which function is taking what arguments the answer is no you don't have to do that all you have to do is you have to go to the modules documentation page and you have to simply go through the documentation wherein it could be mentioned how to use a specific function for example if I search for math module I'll just press ctrl F and I'll say math and this will take me to math module and I'll open this and you'll see that all the functions from the math module are here and this is return the ceiling of X the smallest integer greater than or equal to X and this is something that you can use math dot factorial is a function although we have already implemented factorial but again Matt dot factorial is a function so we can say Matt not factorial and we can say something like 6 and if I type this you'll see the value of factorial 6 will be printed on my output window so if I say for the factorial of 4 is 24 I remember that from the previous video and you can see that 24 has been printed on a screen so the our built-in modules that were already there that comes with your Python distribution now if you want to leverage somebody else's code that has already been written by somebody else you can import or you can install the module using pip which is the Python package manager in order to use pip you will have to open your terminal now I already have my terminal opened here so I don't have to do that again you can always use your macbook terminal you can use your linux terminal as well but I am going to be using this built-in terminal from my Visual Studio code so if you type pip and you press ENTER you'll see something like this and it will give you the information they come on and this is the command that you'll be using most of the times and this is called install and this will install a given package to your computer so what you have to do is simply write pip install and package name I'll give you an example by typing P or maybe OpenCV Python and if I type pip install OpenCV python the requirement is already satisfied which means that I have already downloaded this package so let me try something like pip install numba numba is already downloaded to my system as well I cannot come up with a model that has not been downloaded so we've installed xlrd is something that will be downloaded so this is also already downloaded so I don't I cannot come up with a body limb which is not downloaded to my system know again if you run this command in your computer it will download open CV module from the internet and it will install it for you and if you already have it installed in your system it'll show you something like requirement already satisfied so what I'll do now is I'll simply google search for best Python packages and let me let me see some blocks or something I'm just opening some random links I just want to come up with the name of a module that is not there in my computer so tensorflow scikit-learn pi thought yeah python is something that we install I'll say pipe installed PI dot install my system is hanging for some reason install by dodge and this should download by Tosh to our system and I should not get a requirement already satisfied so it's downloading you can see collecting PI torch and it's downloading pi thoughts no again you don't have to know anything about PI torch so it says that the package name is taught so I'll say v installed torch and this should go through so whatever package name you're writing should go through so this will install torch now inside torch I'll get by dots so you'll have to go through the documentation of the module page and you'll have to see how it works in order to leverage it now it is installing something py YAML it's installing the dependencies as well so now I'm getting this error called no module name tools dot and in wrap if you're getting any such error all you have to do is simply copy this and you have to paste it inside your google search and you should see something like this you'll see some link or something from Stack Overflow most probably and somebody has already answered this question that you have to download it for Python 3.6 because it's not yet stable for python 3.7 so the thing is I have chosen wrong package so you can just go through the package documentation and simply install it using pip install and once you install it and you are using a Python version for which the package is supported you should not be seeing any error so now what I'll do is I'll simply say pre-installed answer flow hub and I hope this is not installed in my system so I use a lot of things and most probably I have everything installed on my system but again tensorflow hob is not installed so it's downloading it'll collect it and then it will install it and after installing it will say successfully installed so I want to show you a successful installation as well so you can see that it's it's installing collected package is protobuf tensorflow hub and i have successfully installed these packages now you can simply use import to import a package now I want to show you something let us say the package name is tensorflow so if I use import tensorflow and if I use answer flow dot something I'll have to write this long name again and again so I can shorten my name by saying something like import tensor flow as PF so instead of tensor flow I'll have to write DF dot something so like I wrote mad dot floor no I don't have to write tensorflow dot something I will write DF dot something and instead of tensor flow hub not something I'll write TF hub dot something I can shorten the names I can even import math as M but in that case I'll have to replace all these mats with M so I'll simply say M here also I'll say M gotta let us say and I'll run it and I will show you that it goes through well it's saying that no module named tensor flow I think I have I don't have tens of install on this in a system I will say if installed tensor flow and if I write people stoned and some flow it will collect answer flow really downloaded for me but again it is not supported for Python 3.7 so you'll have to go back to Python three point six so that is the problem but again I'll remove this line and we don't want to go very fancy here we just want to understand how modules work and how all these things work in Python so I hope you understood this thing and you will now be able to use the modules so what I want to show you is you can go to this page the built in Python modules page which is Python module index and you can go through all these modules and you have a mini short description written here about these for example for math you have mathematical functions you can use sign you can use cos you can use ten there are lot of other functions mostly related to mathematics so you can go and check them out as well as you have some modules like multi-processing for process based parallelism and also you have something called OS which is a very important module and we are going to be discussing this in detail later but again I want you to play around with all these links go to the module documentation page and see which function is doing what so these are the built-in modules once again you don't have to peep install them because they are already there in your system they come off with the Python distribution if you are using Python 3.7 some of the packages which are not not built in packages might not work for example tensorflow creates some problems sometimes so what you have to do is you have to switch back to python 3.6 and make it work but again since you're not doing deep learning and all that stuff right now we are just looking at basic Python Python 3.7 or whatever the latest version during your time is should work fine so what I'll do now is I'll stop this video I want you guys to go through all these modules and also I want you guys to install at least three modules which are not built in and tell me the name of those modules in the description below and I want everyone to comment down below and tell me the name of three modules that you explored and what they are doing just don't simply give me the name of random modules you just have to simply tell me that these are the modules that I explored and these are the functionalities these are the problems that this module is solving for me so I want you guys to comment down and also give this video a thumbs up if you haven't already by any chance access this playlist I want you guys to access this playlist and bookmark it safely keep it safe with you thank you so much guys for watching this video make sure to give this video a thumbs up and I will see you next time [Music]
GRLKc5YdqMg,so guys in this series of videos we talked about a lot of Python stuff we talked about what operators are in Python we did some exercises we talked a lot about strings have strings formatting and all that good stuff now I'm tell you something about for loop now there is something called else with for loop now again you might be thinking hey Harry told me about if statement and you told me about Aleph and else statement now let me create a new file here for you guys and I'll tell you what I'm talking about so I'll close this Explorer I'll also close this output window zoom in a bit and I will say let me start with the program I will simply say my list on let me see Brants is equal to and will list some brands here we'll say Apple I will say Microsoft and then we'll say Nokia and I'm just I'm just writing some random brands here and then we will say HP and then again we will say Eveready now I'll ctrl s to save and I will now use a for loop I'll say for item in brands and I will simply say print the sorry I was supposed to put an F a and I'll say the name of this brand is and I'll say item because I'm using this item as my temporary variable and I am my trading over this item so what I'll do is I'll run this program now and no surprises that we gave me the name of this brand is Apple followed by Microsoft Nokia HP and have already now since this is the first time I am running my Python program after launching visual studio code it might take some time so you will have to give it its time it will take some time to open the terminal then it will run this command and it takes some time so for the first time only the name of this brand is Apple aim of this Brannan's Microsoft and a tie so we used for loop to iterate and it I traded through the list brands know what if I say that ok you print the name of this brand is item but but but but if item is equal to if item is equal to say HP then you have to break now since I'm breaking at HP I will get the name of the brand is Apple then I will get Microsoft and Nokia and HP and I'll miss this one the very fifth brand so if I run this program once again you will see the quad loop terminated at HP so nothing new here we have already talked about this stuff but there is something I want you guys to know and it is else with volume so let us say I write else and I say print this is else after for loop so I'll say ctrl s to save and as you saw I got no warnings from my linter of visual studio code if I type something like this which is not a valid syntax I will get some warnings here some red lines here as you can see here so I have some red lines here and now let me let me remove this and let me press ctrl s to save and now if I remove this if item is equal to equal to HP and I check for for any syntax errors I will not get any syntax error and exactly the same thing we got Apple Microsoft Nokia HP Eveready but here we friend inside the cell statement we got our print statement printed on the output window which is this as else after follow the few if you look at here you will see that we have Apple Microsoft Nokia HP already and then we have this print statement which says this as else after for loop so the question is is this else statement always executed with for loop and why do we use else with for loop now I'll answer this question now I'll show you something and that will explain it even better simply removed these comments from these two lines and I'll press ctrl s to save and I've run this program and as you just saw the else statement is not executed any more I am NOT saying any this is else after for loop anymore what is the reason for that so let me tell you what else with for loop means if I have a break statement and I am successfully able to break the for loop using my break statement I will not have anything which is inside else executed on the other hand if I do not have a break statement or if my break statement fails that is if my item is not equal to this thing and the break statement is never executed what will happen is I will see my else print this is else after for loop on my output window so in a nutshell we can use else with for loops which will only be executed if we successfully execute the for loop but in case we break it if you break it they are not executed so else will be executed only if there is no break encountered but if you encounter a break statement then else will not be printed so in this case else this is else after fall will not be printed so this is something that you'll see in open source codes and you might wonder hey what is this for with else statement now you know what is for with else statement you know when else will get executed when it will not get executed so all you have to do is you have to go to your thoughts for loop and then you have to check for any break statement if it encounters a break statement then you will not go inside the else but if your for loop is successfully executed successfully prints all the values of the list of or all the values that it is supposed to print then you will see print this is else after for loop for example if I remove this if statement then you will see when this is else after follow printed but in case you encounter a break you will not see this as else after for loop as we see here so I hope it is clear to all of you and now you guys will be able to use else with one loop and even if you see it in some open source repository you will be able to you know make out what's happening there so make sure to LIKE this video guys and if you haven't already access the playlist I urge you to access this playlist and bookmark it as soon as possible so that you can access all these videos also if you haven't saved the

ZZmCcASvYAs,all right people so I'm gonna be throwing another exercise for you guys and here you have to print their star pattern for me so what I'll do is I'll create a new file here I'll call it tutorial 18 dot py and I have want you people to print a star pattern for me so I'll write down the problem here you have to print the following star pattern given the number of lines so I'll just ctrl /to comment this and now i'll see that number is equal to and i want you to take input from the user as int and you have to do it as in not string so you have to handle it carefully and your numbers should be an integer after this line so you don't have to use more than one line so i want you to do this in one line one single line number of lines in fact let me call it number of lines and number of lines should be an integer and i want you to do it using one single line so it should be something like four or five but you have to use input function to take input from the user the next task is to print the falling star pattern so this is the star pattern and how i hope this is a simple star pattern and which is the reason i will be calling it twinkle twinkle little star twinkle little star and this is the name of the exercise so this is our exercise 2 and i'll use alt arrow keys to to bring it at the top i'll say exercise 2 and I'll say twinkle twinkle little star this is the name of the exercise so you have to print this star pattern now oops I'll say the output of your program should should look something like this I hope my keyboard doesn't break I don't want to break my keyboard anyways the output of your program should look something like this and this is something you have to print so and say if number of lines is equal to one two three four five four say four let me put it here as if now for number of lines as equal to five the output of a program should look something like this one two three four five and you should have five stars in the last row let me control s to save so this is something you have to do and it's fairly simple and straightforward if you have watched all my videos and if you have accessed this Python playlist I want you guys to access this playlist because I don't want you guys to come to me and ask me questions like what are operators how to use have strings how do you haven't told me what I've string is and you are using f strings and all the videos I don't want you to say this you have to grab the playlist you have to watch the videos right from the very top and I can give you an accurate II that you will learn all the concepts all the techniques that are teaching the videos that are using the videos that I used to make my productivity shine all you have to do is grab the playlist save the playlist and start watching the videos I hope that you all will solve this exercise and I will see you in the solution video of this exercise and I want to see the comments flowing I want you guys to accept the challenge and solve the problem give me the solution and I will analyze your solution I will tell you what kind of things that you need to care take care of for example if you are doing this thing in more than one line I will be giving you a suggestion when I will tell you that you can do it using a one-liner now I don't prefer one-liners all the time but sometimes you should use one-liners as they get the job done very quickly as well as they are more readable than doing something in five to six lines of code so I hope that you like this video and you'll solve the question make sure to give me a thumbs up so thank you so much guys for watching this video and I will see you next [Music]

0YMl1MqMHOw,alright guys so in this video I'm gonna be solving the exercise that I gave you and let me open the video and see how many people solve this exercise and I'm gonna be solving this and believe me this is the easiest exercise of this course and after this you don't have to you know just type a line of code to solve the question I am gonna be making difficult for you so let me sort your comments so I'll say sort by and I'll say new as first so I have some comments here and you can see that sky network has solved this problem but let us come back to the video number 6 and see what the problem Falls so if I go to video number 6 tutorial sixth or py so you were supposed to have a name so you have to redefine a given name stored in a variable called name the output of a program must be in string which means that you have to capitalize the first letter so the capitalized is a function in Python and I shouldn't have used this keyword I should have said that you have to make the first character as uppercase but but let's go to playlist and see ok this is video number 16 so I'll say tutorial 16 dot py I'll press home I'll capitalize the first letter of this filename so let us say you have name is equal to input and you want to say enter your name and then what I'll do is I'll write an F string here I'll say your capitalized name is so many of you guys have used the function which is an inbuilt function in Python and it's called capitalized so let us say if I say name dot capitalized this returns these string capitalized capitalized means the first character of this string will be in uppercase so we're on this program if I run this program it takes some time because for the first time you'll have to wait for some time and later on it it runs so I'm waiting for my program to run and it's asking me for my name so if I say Harry so you're saying you're capitalized name is Harry and you can see H from Harry is capitalized what I will do now is I'll just put a backslash and here and after this I'll tell you another way to solve this problem so you can also do something like this so I'll tell you what was there in my mind while I was designing this exercise I was expecting you to do something like this and I completely forgot about this capitalize function so I was thinking that you would do something like this you'll see upper and then you'll say plus and then you'll say name and then you'll say one two all and you'll slices like this so if you run this program now you'll see that under your name if I say Harry it is giving me h e RR Y inch capitalized so this is this or something I was expecting so what I've done here is I've sliced out the first character from my name and I have converted it to uppercase and then what I've done is I've concatenated this at this character with the rest of the string so I'm taking it from one because I want to have e rry here or if you have any long name then everything except the first character will be there in name 1 2 all so I've already told you slicing and I have already discussed this I'm not gonna be discussing it here if you haven't already grabbed the playlist feel free to grab the playlist here and I have given the link of the playlist in the description as well as you can access it from the channel page I have it with name python tutorial for beginners so I'm gonna be coming back to this video now and I'll give a shout-out to a Skynet Network so a sky network has done the same thing he has used built-in function called capitalised which is fine and I think this is totally fine you should find out the easiest way to solve a problem in the next question or in the next exercise I'll make sure that I hit you up with a problem and that doesn't have a built in function so this had a built in function so this was a test of your google searching and how you are exploring things I think you are doing it well sky network I appreciate that then soon surah so now Sarah I if I've named if I pronounce your name correctly I think you have just given a thumbs up and I really appreciate that but next time I want solution from you then ramitelli Khan and it is thanks I hope this would be another West channel in YouTube and I hope the same game series has used the same technique that I have used here and this was something I was expecting but the winner is Thai Network for this question and I think game series you have done it correctly and you have again he has given two solutions and I really appreciate that I think this is the best solution so far because he has said that you can do it this way and he has also shown the other way the problem can be solved so I think I think I really appreciate this one so coming back to a choice Chaudhary solution and it says programming with Harry's best YouTube channel for learn programming thank you so much as I and he has use a capitalized function nitesh Sharma has used capitalized once again and Droid 0-7 has again huge capitalized so there was nothing here to analyze your solution but again I will make sure that I analyze your solution next time we solve an exercise and next time I give any exercise solution so I hope you are liking the series if you haven't already access the playlist I will say that book market as well as save it by clicking on this button make sure you like this video and make sure to hit that thumbs up thank you so much guys for watching this video and I will see you next time [Music]

gQYMlDdahMY,in this video I'm gonna be talking about conditionals and if statements now programming is all about conditionals and programming is all about creating logic and implementing it in code in this video we are gonna be seeing how to create a program that will kind of think for you and we'll do some kind of thing only if a certain condition is met so let me write tutorial twelve dot P by here sorry tutorial thirteen dot P well since this is a thirteenth video and I have already uploaded 12 videos in my Python tutorials for beginners playlist so make sure to access that playlist and bookmark it or save it wherever you want to coming back to visual studio code I'm gonna be talking about if-else conditions so before I start if-else conditional I want you guys to recall comparison operators that we already studied in our operators video if you haven't already watched that video or any video of this series I urge you to go back to this playlist and starting from the very first video watch it till the very end that way you learn optimally now again let me give you a scenario now and let us talk about something here let us say you asked user for his age and after asking user for his or her age you decide whether you want him to drive or not so let us say H is equal to int input and I'm gonna be giving a prompt here and your age oops I think I did a mistake here it looks good now so after you run this program let me write down an F string here your age is 8 and if I run this program the program will ask me for the age and I'll enter the a then it will print me back and the age that I've already typed so let me also collapse this Explorer so that I have some more space and you can see what I am writing here so it'll ask me enter your age I'm waiting for it and it takes some time when you are running it for the first time and after that it doesn't take that amount of time so it's asking me age let me say 45 saying your age is 45 now based on the age that I have entered if I want my program to perform certain action I can do that so how to do that we are gonna be seeing if statements so all I'll do is I'll say if and inside if I'll say if age is greater than 12 or rather 18 I'll give a colon here now this is pythons index I want you to understand it nicely I just listen to me very carefully and you'll understand it so if I write an if statement here and if I say age is greater than 18 now after I bring a colon here and press enter my visual studio code will automatically give this space or a tab so as you saw that it automatically gave me a tab here as soon as I press enter from here so the moment you press enter you will get an indent now if I again write an if statement here and say all right if one it will give me another indent so I can keep on indenting and I can keep on going inside if statements or for loops that we are gonna be seeing very soon so whenever I say if age is greater than 18 and if I press Enter key you can see that this space is automatically added by my Python in fact my visual studio code now if I press Enter key and if I say print you can drive and after this if statement I can optionally write an else statement so if I write an else statement my control will go inside else statement only if it fails to go in the if statement so it will say print you cannot drive control is to save now if I am NOT able to go inside this if statements because of this condition being false I'll be going inside else statement but if my condition evaluates to true I'll be seeing this statement which means that either if or else will be printed so if I run this program and if you input any which is greater than 18 let me say 45 it will show me you can drive on the other hand if I say something like 4 it'll say you cannot drive so this is how conditionals work in Python now you can have something like if else--if else--if else--if and it is called if as if else ladder let us see how it works in code if I write something like Aleph and if I say age is equal to equal to 27 I'll say print your age is magical and again if I say L if age is equal to equal to 35 and if I say print your age is super magical and if age happens to be neither greater than 18 you know 27 nor 35 it will go inside else and it will print you cannot drive so let me give you an example to show how this works so if I enter an age which is say less than 18 so let us see if I see something like a 34 which is obviously greater than 18 I'll see you can try so if I write something greater than 18 I'll see you can drive now if I give 27 as my age it is obviously greater than 18 so this will never get executed because it will automatically see if age is greater than 18 and no d7 will be greater than 18 it will give me you can't drive as an output so I'll show you so if I enter 27 and not see this one I'll see this one rather and the reason I saw you can drive is because my Python control will come here and it will check whether the age is greater than 18 or not if it is greater than 18 it will ignore all the subsequent Elif Elif and else statement if my age is greater than 18 if my if condition evaluates to true it will ignore all the aleph and al statements after that so if I say if age is greater than 18 now since 27 satisfied this criteria I am saying you can drive printed on my screen if I say something like if ages less than 18 you cannot drive and if it is greater than 18 I'll say you can't drive so if I say something like this and if I input 27 so what essentially will happen is it will say your age is magical why did this happen because I entered 27 has age so it will check if statement if statement will evaluate to false my Python interpreter will say Haddie age is not less than 18 age is greater than 18 so you need to go to next Elif statement now it will check next Elif statement and it will say okay Harry age is equal to 27 we need to stop here and we need to ignore all the Elif and else statements so it will ignore all the subsequent Elif and else statements and you can see your age is magical has been printed on the screen on the other hand if I say age if I input my age is 35 in a presenter it will check this one first this will evaluate to false this will also evaluate to false this will evaluate to true so it will say okay since age is equal to 35 we need to stop here and we need to ignore all the else and Elif statements now by ignoring all the subsequent elephant l statements I mean that all these statements starting from this if to this else will be ignored so starting from this if and this else all the Elif statements will be ignored but if I start another if statement here that will run independently so if I say if one on if true which will always evaluate to true I am always print it so even if I write 37 sorry 27 or 35 let me write 27 this will be printed because age is equal to 27 this will evaluate to true so this will be printed your age is magical and it will ignore all the elephant l statements up till here up till the L statement after that this if statement will run independently and I want you guys to understand this so I hope that if see it meant and statement and if a Lavelle's ladder has been understood by you properly and you can now implement this in code now I want to show you some logical operators in action so what I'll do is I'll comment down this code or rather I'll say that enter your age and I'll see and pay your name and I'll say backslash n now I've already told you that I'll be telling you about escape sequences very soon but consider this backslash n as a newline character so if I run this program now I'll be seeing my prompt in the next line so I'll just remove this white space now if I say if age is less than 18 and name is equal to or so I'll say or I don't want to use n here I want to say a odd name is equal to equal to or name is not equal to hairy so let me save it so you can see that a user will enter his age first and then he will enter his name and if his age is less than 18 or his name is not hairy he cannot drive so if you enter any name other than hairy this will evaluate to false and it will say you cannot drive so let me show you so if your age is less than 18 so if I say 4 and if I say rajeev it will show me you cannot drive because either this or this has to be true for this to be printed for my if statement to get executed so if I want my if statement to go through I need either this or this to evaluate to true in this case my age is 4 so 4 is indeed less than 18 so either this or this has to be true now since this has already been evaluated to true I will go inside the safe statement and I'll see you cannot drive printed on the screen let us say I see something like I enter something like 15 and then I say Harry then it will say you cannot drive now if I enter my age as say 78 and I enter my name is Harry and since both of these conditions are not true this if statement will fail to execute so it will again check for Elif then again it will check for Nextel if the next Elif and eventually it will have to go to else and it has no other option but to execute this or to print this line which is you can drive which is the reason you are seeing this you can drive now this might not be the best example but I know you understood this and I want you to test this in several other examples and several other scenarios and you will understand how if-else Elif all these things work in action so I want to give you a quick quiz and I want to see how many people are solving the quiz so the quick quiz is you have to ask a user for two numbers and if the numbers are or rather if the sum of the numbers is greater than 100 you have to tell them that they have entered a huge number so what you have to do is you have to say hah enter your number and then you have to say enter another number and the user will enter two numbers at the moment the ended two numbers you have to convert them to int and you have to add them up and once you add them up you have to tell them whether it is greater than 100 or not if it is greater than hundred you have to tell them that you have entered a huge number so I hope you like this video I want you to access this playlist as soon as possible so that you don't miss any video and I'm adding more and more videos to this playlist also if you haven't already solved this exercise one I want you to go to the video number 6 and solve this exercise and that way I will evaluate your solution I am evaluating all the solution that I am posting as exercise I will be evaluating all the solutions posted by you so make sure to go to this video and post your solution also make sure to LIKE this video give me a thumbs up thank you so much guys for watching this video and I will see you next time [Music]

Avg_Gjsm7BI,in this video we are gonna be talking about what sets and python are so we have seen lists we have seen double we have seen dictionary and now is the time for set so I've already told you what collections in Python are and we saw that primarily there are four types of connections in Python now what I'm gonna be doing is I'm gonna be creating a new file tutorial to l dot py and let me write sets in Python here if you are into mathematics or something you must be knowing that set is a collection of well defined objects now this is exactly the same thing but since all the students that are watching this course are not in new mathematics I'm gonna be explaining it from scratch let us say I have this my set and this syntax for list was square bracket the syntax for tupple was parentheses the st. expeditionary was this curly brace and the syntax for set is also this curly brace so you might be thinking that if the st. expeditionary and set is the same how will Python interpreter know that whether I want to create a set or additionally the answer is in ditional II we have key value pairs but in set we have direct values so let us say I have this 1 2 3 4 and if I control s to say let me add some more repeating elements and now I'll be saying print a where a is equal to type of my set oops my set kind of less to save and I am gonna be running this program one more thing I want to show you is in visual studio code you can also right-click and close other tabs so if you click this close others all but this tab will be closed so what you have to do is run this program and you'll see class set here this means that this is a set now you must be thinking what is set Harry why are you teaching us what does that is so if I print set if I say a is equal to say my set I will be C the value of my set printed on my output window so you can see I have one two three four five but I had one two three four one four five this is the beauty of set set is an unordered and an index collection and it contains only the unique elements so if you have repeated developments and your elements will be node and Python will only display each element once so this is one two three four five and you're repeating elements will be automatically removed so this is how set works now let us look into the functions that python offers for set so if I do something like my set dot add and if I add 56 then if I print my set so if I say e let me add it before saying is equal to my said and if I ctrl s to save and run it you'll see that 56 has been added so what this is use this will add 56 to this set so this was dot add method now there is one more method which is called dot update and dot update method will essentially add more than one element to your to your set so if I say 45 67 and this will add 45 and 67 to the center so if I control Association if I run this program you will see that I have 67 45 and 56 added to this set so this is how set in python works again you can do something like e is equal to leno set and you will if I can oh let's just save and run this program you'll see that the length of the set is being printed on the output screen so this is how you print length over set now once again if you want to remove an element from a set you can say something like my set not remove and you can remove say 2 from the set ctrl s to save if I do something like a is equal to my set I hope you understanding why I am using this a variable I'm using this so that I have only one print statement and I will keep on updating this variable and I will put it whatever I want to see inside my output window if I run this program now you'll see that - no longer appears in the set so I have deleted my - from the set and this is how you remove an element from this set now there is something called dot discard and dot discard is so I'll give you an example before telling what dot discard is if I try to remove 25 which is not present in the set and if I run this you'll see that I have key error 25 what essentially python is telling me is that you do not have 25 how can you remove 25 if you don't have it in the set so if I want to be free from this error if I want to be free from any sort of key error what I will do is I will do something like this card so instead of this I'll do something like this so let me write this will throw error if 25 it's not there in my set okay and if I say something like this my set or discard 25 then it will not throw any error but again if I give this card an element which is already there in the set then it will remove that element from the set so as you can see 2 has been removed from the set so this is basically how it works and now again we have something like my said dot clear and it will essentially clear your said so if you print your set it will print an empty set now you can see this set here this essentially means that this set is an empty set this is a blank set this is how Python prints an empty set and now once again we can always use del my set and if I do something like del my set it will get rid of my set completely and I will see an error here because my set is no longer there in my Oh Graham now so if I run this program I should be seeing an error saying that my set is not defined because I have deleted my set in line number 10 and I have tried to access it in line number 11 which is wrong so this is how set essentially works in Python I'm gonna be giving you some more methods that you can experiment with I'll say set methods in Python and I'll write all the methods that are important so if you are into mathematics and you are dealing with sets the you will need them but again if you're not into deep mathematics if you are not into advanced stuff then you'll not need it so you can try some methods like add we have clear that I already told you then we have difference and once again we have difference update and I want you to look into what these are doing there are a lot of other methods like is this joint and you can do whole bunch of good stuff you can do something like symmetric difference so if I do something like this if I try to write my set and dot it will show me symmetric difference so this is how a visual studio code intelligence is designed if my set has any method called symmetric difference it will show me that method so you can see what this method is doing you can go to the internet and search for it symmetric difference and again we have Union and intersection as well so you can go and see how all these things work for now I'll end this video let me comment this out and let me say that this line will throw error because my set has been deleted and once again I'm not deleting my set because if you run this program I don't want you to see an error um but again since I've explained you everything you should be good once again if you haven't accessed my Python playlist I would like you to go to my channel and access this Python playlist the link is there in the description as well so if you want to access it from the description you can do that well thank you so much guys for watching this video and let me know if you have any doubts make sure to give this video a thumbs up and I will see you next time [Music]
