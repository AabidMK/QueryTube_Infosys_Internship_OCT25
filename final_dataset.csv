02FucbYPpP0,#23 Match in Python,"In this video, we‚Äôll explore the ‚Å†‚ÄØmatch‚ÄØ‚Å† statement in Python, which works just like a switch-case statement in other programming languages such as C or Java.

We‚Äôll start by discussing when the match-case feature was introduced in Python and how it has become a cleaner and more readable way to handle multiple conditions.

Next, we‚Äôll look at how switch-case syntax works in C and Java, and then compare it with Python‚Äôs ‚Å†‚ÄØmatch-case‚ÄØ‚Å† syntax.
To make it easier to understand, we‚Äôll convert our previous video‚Äôs ‚Å†‚ÄØelif‚ÄØ‚Å† example into a ‚Å†‚ÄØmatch-case‚ÄØ‚Å† version, so you can clearly see the difference in readability and efficiency.

Finally, we‚Äôll discuss why Python‚Äôs match-case syntax is more powerful and flexible than the traditional switch-case in C.

By the end of this video, you‚Äôll have a solid understanding of how to use match-case statements effectively in Python with real examples.

Now if you go back to 1960s lot of languages came into picture. We got B, we got C language and then based on those languages we got new languages we got C++ in 1983. But when Python was under development in 1991 or 1990s basically they missed one thing from other languages. And it made sense because when you look at those languages especially with C we got if else we got l if which we have talked about. Uh but then they also have something called switch. Now switch is a great way to uh do things which we have done. So if you look at the code whatever we have done here let let me remove this part and just print uh three. Now this can be done with the help of switch case as well which is there in the other languages. So instead of using if else we can use switch now this is how it looks like in C language if you use switch for the same thing but there's one problem everywhere if you see there's a break and uh that was a concern and in Java also they carried the same thing but later on they removed it now we don't need to use break in switch in Java but C still exist now Python says okay there's a problem why do we use a break here u and maybe I'm not sure why they they left it but switch was not a part of Python language and it's a part of major languages and this changed in one of the version which is 3.10 10 and uh now we can use switch but with a different name and the name is match okay let's use that so I will just copy the same stuff because we are going to use use this and let's create a new file called match demo py and here I'm going to type it of course we need a num variable as well so we got num is equal to three and I want to do the same thing but with the help of match now how do we do it it's quite simple actually. So instead of this syntax, what we do is we say match and we use a variable which is num. Now the syntax is match. Okay, that's what you have to use and then the variable. Now inside this you instead of specifying the condition, we don't have to manually check if the numbers are matching. You can use a case here. So if the case is one, I will just give a tab because now this is a part of this case is a part of the match. So you will say match uh num then you compare with the first case. If the case is one it will print one. Then if the case is two then it will print two then if the case is three it will print three and likewise I will just change everything else here. So this is case five. Okay. Now we don't have uh we don't have else case. So instead of this we need to use something else. So we have to say case underscore. Now this defines the else part. Okay. And we can say this is incorrect. Now if you look at this syntax which is better than what we have done here because in this we are checking for the values manually and here because see ultimately if you just want to match the value we can use something like this and this looks much better and if I remove the extra spaces in between it will be less less lines of code. Uh if that makes sense. So we can use something called match. So instead of using else if we can use match which looks better. Now this is good for matching but if you want to check for conditions and stuff we can still use if else. So yeah that's match for you but then I we have not we're not running this yet. So I will just say python match_demo. py and if I clear this let run this once again. So you can see we got three but if I say value is six and we don't have six. So it will should it should print incorrect. So things are working out. Okay. And this is the better syntax compared to what you have in C as you can see on the screen. So yeah, that's how you use match. See you in the next video. [Music]"
jY0MMsMxyX0,#22 elif in Python,"In this video, we‚Äôll learn about the ‚Å†‚ÄØelif‚ÄØ‚Å† statement in Python and how it helps make our conditional logic more efficient and readable.

We‚Äôll start with a simple number input and text printing example to understand how using only ‚Å†‚ÄØif‚ÄØ‚Å† statements causes multiple unnecessary checks.
Then, we‚Äôll see how to optimize the code using ‚Å†‚ÄØelif‚ÄØ‚Å† for better performance and cleaner logic.

You‚Äôll also learn how to use a combination of ‚Å†‚ÄØif‚ÄØ‚Å†, ‚Å†‚ÄØelif‚ÄØ‚Å†, and ‚Å†‚ÄØelse‚ÄØ‚Å† to handle multiple conditions effectively.
After that, we‚Äôll explore a nested if example to understand how conditions can be placed inside other conditions.

Finally, we‚Äôll go through everything step-by-step using the debugger, so you can clearly see how Python executes each condition behind the scenes.

This video will help you build a strong foundation in Python conditional statements and write smarter, optimized code.

So that's right. We have talked about if else and now it's time to go for else if that's reverse of it. Now why do we need it? So what I'm going to do is I'm going to create a new file here and let's name it as L if dot I mean L if demo py. Now this is a simple file. Now what I'm going to do here is uh let's take an example to understand this. Let's say we have a number which is one and I mean this number can be anything. I want to print the word format of it or name format of this. So if I say one, it should print O N E. If I say two, it should print TWO. And of course this should not be done with the help of AI. We want to manually print those values. Now we will do from 1 to 5 so that will not waste a lot of time for all different numbers. So here uh how do we do it? Uh I want to print. So of course here there should be a print statement which will print one and then likewise we'll we need uh five more I mean four more. So we got four five here and this should be two this should be three this should be four and five. Okay so we got this five values. Now based on what number you enter here it should print one of them. But here if you directly try to do this and if I try to run this file which is l if demo okay l if demo py you you will see it will print everything we don't want to print everything we just want to print one thing which is this so based on one it should print one and if I say let's say three it should print only three now the way you can do that and we have done that before what you can do is you can use if so you can check if num is equal to equal to one in that scenario you can give a colon here and then you can give that in a tab so it will only print one right and we can do it for others as well so this will be if if the number is two then you will print two right and I think I should do it for everything now without wasting your time and the last one I'm already feeling tired now so if I say five it should print five okay now this will work because we know how if works it will check if the number is one then it will print one. If the number is two, it will print two. If the number is three, it will print three. And then so on. Or if I run this, it will print three. And whatever number you have, if you if you type five, it is going to print five. Now, of course, if there's a number which is let's say six. Now, we don't have any number for this or name format for this, it will print nothing. But maybe I want to print something here. So, so in this case I can say else or maybe I can say if the number is more than five or any number apart from five I can print incorrect. Okay. So even if you say six now it will print incorrect. Uh but then this will not work for negative numbers right? So it will negative numbers it will uh it will print nothing because negative numbers are not even matching with this and even this is not a good idea. But we'll see that later. How do we solve it? But this is how you do it. And we know that from debugging it will check each condition. So even if I apply debugger here the moment you run this it will check for each value. So even if you type two which is matching here it will still go all over the if. So it will check this it will check this it will check this it will check this as well. Now we don't want that. Now in that scenario we can use else but then we can only use else once right. So if you have if you remember if you have used if here and then you can use else only once. So what if I want to use else for this first if everywhere if this if is true then we don't have to execute all the other conditions. In that scenario you can use something called else if. Now in C we use lsafe. In Java we use lsafe. In C I think we use lsafe. In Python we use lf. It's saving some characters. That's it. So we can use lf here. And I will talk about what LF is once I change all the ifs to L ifs. Um not the first one but others. First need to be if. You can't directly use L if at the start because else makes sense when you have if right. So what we have here is we got if then for this if we got multiple else if or else ifs. Uh the last one can be else is because if none of them is matching we can simply say else. So we can have this syntax. We can have if, else if and else. And in between we can have multiple else if. It's just that if can be only one, else can be only one. L if can be any number of times in between. Now how exactly this is working? Again we can check that from debugger. So I will just click here and sometime my VS code is giving issues with the debugger. I hope this time it will work otherwise I have to do the dry run and okay there's no problem. We can do it now. So it will first check if this is matching. No, it will jump to the next part. Is this matching? Yes, it will go to it will print two. And once it is completing its job, it it will directly come out of the if block. And you can see it is just came out. But let's say if you if the number is six. Now in this case, it will jump all over. So Python debugger. Okay, I'll just launch from here. So now if I say next, it will check not matching. check not matching. So it will check all the else if not matching and then it will jump to else. Okay. So that's how else if or l if works. Now of course you can have nested stuff here. Maybe you can check if uh so let's say if I have one more variable here which is salary and salary is let's say five and this can be uh a bitcoin as I mentioned. So this can be bitcoin dollars doesn't matter. So if the salary is less than five or maybe the salary is greater than or equal to five in that scenario I want to print three otherwise you know when you get less salary you can mess up the stuff uh you can print three whatever you want so we have not done that before right okay we have done that salary here okay cool so we can do the same thing here so we can print three or we can print three if your salary is less than five so you can have nest Ed if else here as well. So you get flexibility what whatever you want to do. So yeah that's how you basically work with else if see you in the next video. [Music]"
CllLqPwCjD4,Getting Structured Output in JSON format,"In this video, we‚Äôll explore how to generate structured output in JSON format using LLMs (Large Language Models).

We‚Äôll start by discussing the benefits of structured data ‚Äî how it ensures data consistency, enables easy software integration, and makes database storage and management more efficient. 

Next, we‚Äôll take a real-world example by generating iPhone 17 details in JSON format and observe how the model sometimes produces inconsistent or varying structures.

To solve this issue, we‚Äôll learn how to generate an exact JSON structure with only the properties we need ‚Äî such as name, price, features, and specifications.

By the end of this video, you‚Äôll understand how to guide AI models to produce clean, structured, and predictable outputs ‚Äî ideal for API development, database storage, and real-world AI integrations.

It will do some work and it will give you the required information. But see now we have to look at from a developer perspective. See when you build application you want data from AI right now in general when you want data where you look for we look for data in the database right. So we have the application we try to get this data from database and or maybe let's say front end if front end wants data it will get it from the back end. Now how do you send data from the back end to the front end you use a format now this format can be XML format or this can be a JSON format and nor nowadays we use JSON format on the other hand if you have a back end which is asking for the data from some other server even there you transfer JSON data. So that means we are used to work with JSON formats right. So if you have an object let's say in Java or Python you basically try to fetch data and you want to convert that data from JSON to object format. In the same way if you want to fetch data from AI in what format you're looking for of course JSON. Now till this point when we worked with the prompt engineering we were basically working with the text and it's okay to get text but then how will you pass it? How will you make a use of th those text and specifically when you talk about AI you don't get the standard text from the AI sometime you get extra stuff sometime you get the main thing at the end so you can't predict that and that's where you have to work with the structured output now how do you get it and to do that let's take an example of an application which needs the data about a particular phone so let's say you're building an application where you want to show data about a phone so I will say I need details of iPhone air. Okay. Uh so when I do that now it's already launched right? iPhone is there in the market. You can buy it. I mean should you buy it or not? That's a different question. But you can buy it. And if you say enter, it should say this is the phone which was launched and these are the price. Uh let's see what it says. It says iPhone is a model of iPhone lineup announced and blah blah blah. Okay, good. So it's able to fetch the data which we need. Okay. So everything is there. Now before making a video I was doing some experiments and once it it said that it is rumored that iPhone air is going to launch. So maybe even Germany had don't have the updated data about iPhone. Maybe it's Google versus Apple. I'm not sure but this time it is giving you that's good thing. But you have to also assume that AI might not give you the correct information or the latest information. Right? So just by saying I need details of an iPhone air might not give you the exact information. So if you want exact information what you can do is you can say uh I need details about iPhone air and you can also add a source in case if LM is not able to find data about it. Uh we'll talk about this concept later what I'm doing now how I'm injecting the source in the prompt. we have some concept for it or maybe it's more about adding context to the prompts and when I do that it will specifically go to that website scan understand what is happening and then it will give you the answer so even maybe this is right and this should be right because we have pass a source now and if you go up here let's look at the price section so when I looked at the price okay now whether is a price is it or maybe I'm not able to find anywhere but then even if it gives you a price and maybe you can see on the screen it might give you in dollars. Now specifically I am recording this video from India. So it should give me Indian price and when I pass the source it is I in here and that's why you can see we got the price in rupees. Additionally it should give you some more information. It's not doing that. Now uh in my experiment it was giving option of colors and okay there's a section here. Okay. So everything is you you got it here. But again the problem is it is giving you data in the text format. How will you pass this in the application? Now that's where you can ask AI to give this information in the JSON format. So what I will do is I will just copy this part because I want to reuse it and paste it here. But additionally I will mention give me this information in JSON format. Okay, when I do that it will give you JSON format. That's what we requesting for right. So it is its job to give that data in JSON format. And yeah, you got it. So you can see uh it is giving this data iPhone ad announced released. Okay, that's good. So it is able to give the data pricing in Indian MRP. We got all these details and okay looks good. Looks good. This is how the JSON data should be right. But there are chances that it will give you some extra details. Okay. By the way, you can unlock the full functionality of all the apps. Enable. Oh, okay. This is a new feature. Not sure. But you can see with this data, it is also giving you some text. Okay. And this is what we don't want. So if you I mean not the same date text every time but it might give give you some additional text with the JSON. We don't want additional text. So what you can do is you can use the same prompt but you can add more details here. And let me show you that details and I I do have it here so that I don't have to do that and type that by myself. So this is the additional prompt. So instead of saying give me this information JSON format I can just write this respond only with valid JSON object because then it will also validate if the JSON which is sending is correct or not. Uh in this case I'm not sure if this is a valid JSON and I have the feeling now it's not a valid JSON. Okay. And you let me know why in the chat this is closing here. Where is the opening? Okay. This is not a valid JSON. Okay. That's good. Uh so now I'm mentioning respond only with JSON object and do not include any text or explanation. I'll just keep it copied so that we can reuse it later. And now it says in an occur previous search already provided this information. So another search is not required. Okay. So it is not doing the thing which I want. Very bad. I paid for it. Let me do that once again. Why it's not doing it? Let me go for a new chat. I don't know what went wrong there. Is it the scenario when it gives you one information it will not repeat? Saw this for the first time. Let me know if you have faced that before. Okay, now you got a JSON format and which looks a valid JSON format. If not, let me in the chat. Okay, looks like a valid JSON. Cool. And you can see there's no extra text anywhere. Not at the start, not at the end. And this is what you need, right? So this is how basically you can work with JSON format. But there's one more thing which is missing here which is or not a missing part but then if you think as as a developer when you build objects right so to represent a particular data you build objects right and this object will have certain properties so let's say I want a phone class and I phone class have these properties where you got the model name you got the price you got the RAM CPU so you have a limited set of properties which you want to assign to if you look at this JSON it has a lot of data which maybe I don't need uh example let's say maybe I don't need optical zooming of 1x2x maybe I don't need uh the USB speed okay so it is giving you everything a good thing but we don't require those things so how do you specify what JSON format you need now in this case I have one more prompt here and I will show you that prompt step by step so this is a prompt and let me just go through this one by one So at this start I'm saying you are an expert data extraction system. So I'm also specifying a role there. And if you remember we have talked about role prompting. Your task is to extract. So we are specifying the instruction. The key specification for iPhone air input uh from providing text format into JSON format. So specifying the output format and this output format should be a JSON. Do not uh put any explanation on text. Then we are specifying the JSON object format. So this is JSON object must strictly add to the following schema extracting the information from the text below. So I need model name. We don't need to specify the model name. Maybe in future I'm going to work with Samsung or maybe OnePlus whatever the type is or phone is. Then uh you can specify the type or display then processor what else we have design and operating system. So these are the details I want and I'm also specifying the source from where you will get this. And when I do that, it will return the JSON format exactly in that format. Let's see. And yeah, you got it. So you can see we got model name, display, processor, camera, design, and operating system, right? So yeah, this is what uh you can do when you work with the AI to give you JSON data. So your prompt need to be good. You have to specify the role. You have to specify the JSON JSON format and we're going to work with it. Now, how do you use that in the code? We're going to see that later. Okay. So, I hope you'll enjoy that. I hope you enjoyed this part."

Now what exactly nested if means? Nested means one inside the other. So if you have if here and then you are printing here. Let's add some conditions or something. So let's say based on some other value what whatever variable you want to use here. Let's say I'm going to say salary. Again it's it's bad to compare the salaries but let's do it. It's fun. So let's say we got a salary as five and we don't know what this currency is. It can be rupees, dollars or bitcoins. Uh if the salary is five, I want to print great job. If the salary is less than five, I mean greater than five, great job. Less than five, better luck next time. Something like that. But only if if it's a even number. Okay. So of course I can do that outside if it just want to print great job or better luck next time. But I want to do that only when the number is even. So that means I have to do that inside this if. So we can do this. We can write if inside if something like this and I can say if salary is more than five, I can simply print here great job. Else I can print better luck. Better luck next time. Okay. Now what we do trying to do here is we are saying if inside or if else inside the if block this called nested if nothing fancy simple stuff just wanted to show you how it works and let's run this and you can see it says better luck next time because the value is not more than five but if I say seven and if I try this now it says even and great job but now if I make this as a odd number it doesn't matter what the salary is now it's not going to execute them it will only print odd because the entire block is skipped as soon as it says it's this condition is false. So that's how we can use neative [Music]"

See the thing is AI has lot of knowledge. It knows what to answer, how to answer. It's just that you have to be very specific what you want to ask for. So it is like a smart person in the room, the smartest person in the room and then if you want to know something and if you go to that person and say I want to know about this if that person has the context what you're asking of course you will get amazing answer and provided you also mention some other things. Example, let's say if you ask about Java to me and then I will just because you asked about Java, I will talk about it for let's say two hours. And maybe you don't even want to know about Java for 2 hours. You just wanted to get some basic information or maybe some specific information about Java. So it depends upon what kind of question you ask and how smart I am to understand the room and the situation of where you are asking this question. Now AI don't have any context, right? So by default it will assume certain things based on what you ask but you have to be more specific in what you ask to get the answer which you want and that's where we have something called a prompt engineering. So what you do is when you talk to the AI you send a prompt. Now based on your prompt it will give you the answer. Now it depends upon how good your prompt is it will give you a better answer. Now when AI came into picture so when I say AI came into picture you might be thinking okay we're talking about post November 2022 but no AI is there from a long time and maybe we have talked about it before it's just that it was mostly for the business use cases right so all the AI features before it was mostly for the business let's say Netflix or if you're playing chess online if you talk about the product recommendation so everything was using AI but now AI is there in the hand of every human being you just open chat GP or Gemini and then you can basically use it and that's where how to talk to AI becomes important. Okay. Now question arise if you want to send a prompt how will you do it? So let's say on this screen we got two gemies here. Of course you can use JPA but I have the subscription for Germany. I'm going I'm going to use that. On the left hand side we are going to send some prompt which are bad prompts and on the right hand side we got a window where I'm going to enter a good prompt and that's what we're going to talk about in this video. Now the beauty is or the thing is if we if if I made the same video in 2022 this would have been a better comparison but now LLM are getting smart day by day. So maybe if you write a good prompt or a bad prompt you might get similar results because LLM are getting smarter. But when I say you might get the similar answer, the main point here is might. And we don't want to have that dependency or confusion that what output it will give. So if you have a better prompt, you know what kind of answer it will give. You can specify what output format you want. You can specify how it should give the answer. And that's why good prompting or the great prompting always works. Okay. So let me show you some examples. and uh let's see if this is making sense. Uh we're going to start with a simple prompt. Okay. And I do have some prompts ready with me so that it will not waste a lot of time. So let's say I want to know about APIs. Now one of the one of the way you can do is I can say API. Okay. So I just want to know about API. The moment I do that, it depends upon how smart my AI model is. And since I'm using a pro model here, so it might give a better answer. So you can see it says, could you please provide more context? And in fact AI says please provide more context. API is a very broad broad term. Uh maybe you can be very specific like what is what is API? Explain the common APIs or stuff. Now when I say you have to provide more context maybe if you can give a good prompt. Now how do you define a good prompt? So there are certain components in a good prompt. Now what are the four components? The first one is instruction. So when I say API maybe you can be very specific here what you want to know about API. So I can say explain API. Okay. So this is an instruction. Okay. So when I say explain API that's an instruction. Uh API being an input here. So if we have talked about two components the instruction which is explained in this case and then the input which is API in this case. Now question arise why I want to learn API. there should be some reason right in the world or maybe you just got up and then you want to have you want to spend some time with AI you're asking random questions but normally we do have a context so let's say I'm exploring fast API in python or maybe I'm exploring spring uh web where I'm going to create APIs so that is my context where I'm doing that so I can say explain API in fast API in python now what I'm doing is I'm also providing a context here so this is my instruction this is my input And this is my context. Okay. Now this will help AI to give you a better answer. Okay. So we have talked about three things in the in in those components of four. The instruction the input the context. Again you can have this sequence in a different way. Maybe you can have instruction context and input based on your situation or based on you how you want to give it and how smart your AI model is. So those are the three things but we have one more the type of output you are expecting. Uh so maybe I I want to say with code example. Now this is a kind of the output I'm expecting. Maybe it will not give me the uh the coding just because of this things and I want to be specific. I want code example there. So this is how you build a good prompt. So this was a bad prompt. This is a good prompt. So you specify the instruction. You specify the input context and the output you're expecting. And when you say enter now, this will give you a better result. So it says API is a in context of fast API. In fact, that is saying that it's a context and fast API. Uh this blah blah blah and then there are multiple components. Again, we don't we are not here to learn fast API. You can do that on my channel. There's a video on fast API. Uh then we got code example which is this bit complex. Maybe I could have given a better context that I'm a beginner and that would have given me a simple example. So the more context you add it will give you a better output. So this is a difference between a good prompt and a bad prompt. I'm using a wrong sequence. Okay. A good prompt and a bad prompt. Okay. Now let's go for the techniques in prompting. So even in good prompts there are different techniques available. Now one of the technique is called a zero short prompts. Now what is zeros short prompt is you have a question in your mind and you maybe you want to know something you just write a prompt and this is a zero shot you just use a prompt and you will get the answer and in most of the time we do this okay so if you want to if you're curious about something or if you want to know about something instantly you just write a prompt you get the answer you're done you just close your AI uh model or AI window and you're done but then if you want a very specific output see we are learning this concept for AI engineering right where you are going to build application which is going to interact with AI and it will behave in certain way based on how AI is responding or the model is responding. Now in that scenario you have to be very specific what kind of output you want. So in that case you can use something called a few short prompting. And to do that what I will do is I will go back here in this window and I will write a prompt which is this. Now I'm asking write a commit message for adding a login button. See whenever you work on the application you want to commit those changes and maybe you want to push it on the uh GitHub. Now in this case when you commit a particular feature or you are fixing something of course you want a good commit message and for me especially I find it more difficult to uh write the commit message than actually code that feature. And why it's so important is because your commit message matters because when you are uh trying to understand what you have done previously or maybe what commit you have done the commit message are helpful and not just for you even your colleagues needs that messages or those messages and when you enter this it will give you a commit message. You can see it says feature add login button to a navigation bar. uh it gives you multiple options right but what if you just want one option and what if you want in a particular format now the good thing is LM are getting smarter okay so it is giving you this type of suggestions but maybe it will not always give you this particular format so how do you do it or maybe not every model will give this type of format I'm using 2.5 which is a very good model but if I use a older model or any cheaper model maybe I'm not I will not get the same output now in this scenario what you can do is you can do you can use something call a few short prompting and to do that what I will do is I will write the same prompt here but then I also give some examples something like this. So example one, example two and example three. Okay. So what it will do is it will check okay whenever a user says this particular feature this is the commit message a user types or maybe I type for this particular change I do this type of uh commit or message. when I when I have a new change I want AI to suggest me a commit message and when I do that it will give me a particular feature now this looks similar right but then it's a guarantee that you will get this type of commit message is because you are specifying some examples now this is called a few short prompting this is very helpful when you want a specific type of output and you're not dependent on whatever model you're working with and what type of answer they will give so we have talked about zeros prompting we have talked about few short prompting. Now let's go for the next one. The next one is chain of thoughts or you can say coot. See what happens is when you let's let's go back to our school time and when you try to uh when you when you have a math assignment basically you complete the assignment you show to your teacher and maybe you will not even show it to your teacher. You will see your teacher will ask what was the answer and if you give a particular answer that answer might be right or maybe wrong. Now if it is right the teacher is not still not sure if you have done the steps correctly and I still remember those days when we used to use different formulas and different formulas were giving same answer. But then teacher wanted to know what kind of formula I have used. So what teacher will say is okay show me the homework right and she will see the homework and if she is satisfied with the type of steps I have followed she will say good otherwise she will say okay this is not how you do it. you might got the right answer but the connect the technique was wrong. Okay, in the same way I we can ask AI to show their homework and this is where you can do something called a chain of thoughts. Let me show an example. I do have a prompt with me. I will just copy it from here and paste it maybe here. Now when I do that now based on the model if I'm using a lower model I might not get the calculation. Now this is a simple question where a web server has 100 GB of disk space and then it runs a database with 40 GB then there are three user application which takes 10 GB each and then I have uploaded if I upload 25 GB of backup file how much free space I have a simple calculation now what it will give you is this the remaining free space is 5GB now this might be right or wrong I'm not sure and that's why your model also gives you calculation but then it might not give you calculation every time. But what if you want to see this calculation every time? So what you can do is you can write the same prompt but then I will simply say think step by step. Now what we are doing here is we are asking AI to slow down because AI have this tendency of answering your question very very fast and if you want it to slow down you can say think step by step take your time I'm not in hurry. Now by doing this you are making sure that your AI model is actually thinking about it and then giving you answer slowly and you can see it says 5GB which is the correct answer because you also got five here but then it is showing you the exact calculation here also we are doing it but there's no guarantee that it will give you calculation here we are saying that think step by step so it will go step by step and then it will calculate 5GB. Okay. Now this is called chain of thoughts. You are asking it to think step by step. Now let's move to the next one which is the role prompting. Now I use a role promp prompting a lot. Maybe for my scripts, maybe for uh learning something. So if I want to explore a new concept, I want AI to teach me. I can't simply ask AI to uh teach me something. For example, if I say teach me Java uh exceptions and of course it will try to teach me in this sequence, right? But then AI has no idea who I am and how it should behave while teaching. So we can be very specific what kind of teaching I want AI to do or how it should teach and who am I. So here what you can do is you can assign a role to your AI something like this. Maybe I'm I want to know about smart contracts. So I can say act as a senior blockchain architect. So you're giving a role to AI and explain the concept of smart contracts to the junior developer using a real world analogy. Now AI will behave like a smart the senior blockchain architect and then it will uh basically try to understand who it is talking to a junior developer. So of course you can't simply use fancy terms and I can do the same thing here. I can say explain this smart contract. Let's do that here first and let's see how it behaves. So it is giving an example of a vending machine. Okay. And then a table. It's still doing a good job because I think if I even if I'm a junior developer I I may be able to understand what is talking about. But again we are not sure how it will behave right. So by writing this type of prompt you are sure how it should think and behave. It might give the same example. You're just giving the same example but it will think in a real life and it will talk to the junior developer. It will use those terms. Okay. And this is your role prompting. And based on this now we can go for our last step which is see when you write a prompt of course you you will write the instruction you will write the input because input is very important. You will write the context. The more context you provide the better the output you would be. But then it also it is also important what kind of output you're getting. So example let's say I I'm making an application and I'm good with back end and front end maybe I'm struggling with front end I want to learn a front-end technology maybe react view there are so many things right every 6 months you get something new there I'm not sure which one to start with so what I can do is I can ask AI I'm confused between three technologies you help me with which one I should go for now if I just write compare react angular and view it will give me a tabular structure which is a good thing. U I I'm not sure if the smaller models will be able to answer this type of uh things but it is giving me the table as well and more content but maybe I'm not concerned about other things you know data flow or uh language or from where it is coming from my concern if I want to learn anything from this is more about how fast I can learn it or the learning curve or where I can use it maybe I want to focus on those things. So again very specific what kind of output I'm I'm looking for. So this type of prompts will be helpful. So compare the JavaScript frameworks or maybe tools like React, Angular or Vue. Provide the output. Now this is important. Provide the output as a markdown table with three columns. The framework, React, Angular or Vue. The primary use case and the learning curve. Now when I do that of course I will get the similar answer but in a good way focused only on those three things, right? much better than this table because there are some extra stuff here which I'm not even concerned about. uh example when you buy a new laptop and if you want to compare those laptops you can be specific you know what kind of configuration you want to compare not the color of the laptop not the weight maybe I'm weight is not concerned for me what is more important is the CPU RAM the type of GPU it has so those things right so you can be very specific of what kind of output you're looking for and when it comes to AI engineering and when you have an application which interacts with the AI you have to be very specific what kind of data you're working with and this is not just table you can also get uh CSV formats or JSON formats you can be you can specify those things there and this will be helpful so yeah that's about prompt engineering the basics so that we can go for the next step okay I know we are a bit late with the prompt engineering but it's never too late so that's it from this video see you in the next part bye-bye"

So basically what we are doing here is we are checking if the number is is this statement here or this condition is here is true. If it is true it will execute even right and then we are checking if this statement is true. If it is true will it will print odd. Now what's wrong with this code or not? Why it is not efficient is what if you are passing number six. Okay. And then you are checking for this and we know it will be true so it will print even. Now when we know it's even then why it has to even check for this particular block here. Don't you think it is assumed that if a number is even it's not going to be odd? We are not into a quantum mechanics where you'll be having multiple states at the same time. Uh so here it has to be one either it should be even or odd. How do we do that? And that's why you can do either it can be even or it can be odd. So or okay so something we have to use there odd. So we can say if this is true then execute this else execute this English else. So instead of this I can simply use else and that works. So as you can see we are saying if this block checking condition if it is true it will print else it will print this. Let's try it out and let's see if it's really working run this it says even and now if I say seven not 78 that's a big number to check and you can see it says odd. But now it'll be saying hey how do we trust you? How do we know that if this is getting executed this is not going to execute or or it will not even go to else. Now to see the proof we need to understand how debugging works. Okay. Now first of all what is debugging? Now see when you when you talk about applications now in your application when you write a code of course it should behave the way you want it but sometime when you write a code you make a mistake not the syntactical errors. Example if you miss this particular colon here. Now this is just a syntactical error. Your compiler or your ID will say what you doing? Okay so you can see all this red bar here. There's a red line here as well which shows where the error is and also red. So everywhere you can see red red and even if you try to run this it will give you some bad words. Okay. So it says what what else you are I think you missed this particular colon there. So this is syntax error and this is easier to solve. But when you have logical error where you have written some wrong statement somewhere and because of that it is not giving you the expected output. example my by mistake if you say one year the code will work there's no compile time errors it will give you error while you're running it uh okay when I say error it means it will give you some wrong output if you know it is wrong output you can actually see hey why it is wrong but most of the time you don't even know if the output which you're getting is wrong and that's tricky so uh and that's why we normally do testing and all those stuff to see whatever based on some inputs how you are getting the outputs but here let's say if you want to debug. So these things you know the logical errors are normally called bugs and when you have bugs you basically have to remove them find them remove them and this the process of doing this we call it as debugging removing bugs and as straightforward right and based on this I have this very poor joke but also it makes lot of sense uh if debugging is removing bugs then what is coding it's adding bugs. Every time you write a statement, it can be a potential bug, right? Uh example, this statement, I don't think there's a there's a bug here, but this can be a bug or maybe if you're writing very complex software. Every line can be a potential bug. Uh how do we solve it? First, debug the application. Second, do testing like unit testing, automation testing, you can do those things. But here we are talking about debugging. So, let's stick to it. So, what's the process of doing this? Now in most of the ids if you look at the play button here and if you drop down this you will see an option of running a file which is straightforward. When you click this it will run the file but also you will find something called a debugger. Now it's very straightforward when it comes to PyCharm because PyCharm is built for Python but VS code on the other hand is built for multiple languages. You can use C, C++, Java, C#, uh, Python, JavaScript, you can do everything here and it gives you that flexibility that you can run any file. If you want to debug based on some conditions, uh, you can do those things. So, it is straightforward button here in um in PyCharm. But here it says okay, you have to debug. It might give you a prompt to select which type of thing you want. uh in fact if I don't do these things from here there's also an option here run debug you can click on run debug it will give you this prompt where you can select okay uh I want to go for Python debugger in case if you're not seeing this option so maybe you don't have the Python extensions how do I verify that click on this extensions and search for Python scroll down and make sure that you have Python from Microsoft as extension if you don't have it search for it install it simple stuff again when you install it you have to restart your ID to get the effect okay so uh let's debug this now I clicked on it debugging and nothing happened something happened here it is printing the output but how do I do this uh so what you can do is if you can see there is uh when you go here it show you this red bubble or red color red circle uh this is called a break point in debugging you can mention okay execute all the statements and stop where you want to check. So you can add a break point here because this is where I want to check. Then you can go back here and click on Python debugger and then you can see it ran till here. Maybe it doesn't matter how many statements you have before that before this if it will execute all and it will stop here because this is where you're adding a break point and then from here you can run step by step and this is called step over. So if you can see there's a button here which is step over. Uh you can also do that from F10. Uh but yeah I can actually use because see normally when you are actually debugging the application you don't want to touch your mouse right you just want to do that from the keyboard and say okay F10 F10 F10 because you're focusing but since I'm recording a video I have this mic between my eyes and my this keyboard so I will stick to mouse. Uh on the left hand side you can see we have variables here. These are all your special variables and this is a variable which you have created. So if you have multiple variables you will see that here. Again when we go for loops it will make much more sense. So you will see more variables there and this is where you can have some watch again. We'll see that later. Now let me go for the next step. So I will click step over. You can see it is skipping the entire print here is because this condition is false. It is jumping to else suite. Right now if I make this six again I have to stop it and I will go for six here. And let's do the debugging now. Or I can just say okay if you want to start a debugger you can also click here. Otherwise you can click F5 or function F5 whatever is there. Run debugger and stopped here. Now if I click on step over it will print this because six is a even number and then it will just jump out directly to buy. You can see it is skipping this else part. If is true then it will skip the else part. So the idea was to talk about debugging which we are going to use this multiple times later. Oh now I'm tired. It's time to take a small break and move to the next part. Maybe one of you also tired watching the video. Take a small break. [Music]"

See when you work with programming it's not just about calculations. We have done that till now right? Adding the numbers subtracting them or maybe you also are trying working with the data. So maybe you're trying to save it. You're fetching some particular element from the data. We can do those things. But what makes a software very powerful is the power of thinking. That's right. Okay. We are not talking about AI at this point. We're just saying a software should be able to think when to do what based on some conditions. Should we go this way? Should we go that way? And that can be done with the help of something called if. In fact, there is a list here. We can talk about if if else. And there's also something called else if which we're going to see in the upcoming videos. So let's get started. So the first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to create a file and we'll name this as if demo. py. Again a file a simple file name. And in this let's try to demonstrate what is if. So we can call it as a if statement and it's just that my co-pilot is unable and it is giving you suggestions. Okay. Uh just because the file name AI is getting smarter day by day. So I just want to snooze it for maybe few hours because I'm going to record videos now. I don't want your suggestions copilot for some time. Okay. So let's see the use case for if. See when you want to execute certain statements based on some conditions maybe you want to execute this bunch of statements or you want to execute that bunch of statement that can be done with the help of if. Now how do we use it? So first of all let's take a number variable with the value six. Again the value imagine this value is coming from the user. And now once you got this value I want to check if the given number is even or odd because what is the best example for if to start with? It's always even odd. So uh what I'm going to do is I'm going to print here which is even and let's also print odd. So we are printing even we are printing odd. But if you execute this particular statement or this particular file here which is if demo py you can see it is printing both. It is printing even it is printing odd and that's odd. Right? Uh okay, ignore my poor jokes. But the point is I want to execute either even or I want to execute odd. I don't want both at the same time based on this value. So now we know we know we are smart. We know a six is a even number. It should print even. How do we do that? So we have to explain to the program hey you know what do you mean by even odd? It's very simple. If okay now this is how you use the syntax. You basically specify if and then you specify true or false because if ultimately look for true and false. So if you say true here that's how the syntax is if and then true or false and then give a you you give a colon and then here you put print inside it. Now this is called a suite. So this is a block. Normally in programming languages other languages like C, C++, Java, C# name the language you normally use curly brackets. But Python says hey we don't do that here. Uh we basically use tab here and which makes sense why to waste extra curly brackets on the screen which makes programming bit difficult. See if you are coming from other languages like C or C++ you are getting used to it. So you know what a curly brackets are and when you look at the code you didn't you don't get scared by it. But imagine if someone is looking at the C code or C++ code for the first time they skip their heartbeats for a second. Okay. or they just ignore the file here. Python wanted to make it simple. So here we got so it's if as a as a block which we call as a suite and we do that with the help of the if uh keyword then we specify true or false then give a colon and then whatever statements you want to put inside if you do that with the help of this particular space here. Okay. Uh example let's say if I just comment this odd part for time being and let's say if I want to print okay caps lock is on. If I want to print let's say by now if you observe I'm putting this print even inside the if suite or I can say a block but if I'm I'm keeping this by outside now how do I know it's outside? There's no opening and ending. is just that the spaces for this particular thing I'm using four spaces so it will check okay this is four spaces that means whatever statements after this are going to be part of if if they have four spaces example here if I doesn't matter how many tabs how many spaces you have between two statements if you have that four spaces here or one tab it will be treating that as a part of if okay so I want to show you that by running it so I will run it you can see just printing even and by both why both is because if true when you say it is true it will simply check it is true okay that means I just have to execute this so this block or this suite will be executed when it's it says true so that means yes it is going to print even also by is because it is part of it okay but then even if you keep it outside it will still going to print you know why it's because this is true so of course it is going to print even and print pi is a outside part. So it is going to execute anyway. I know you don't trust me. What I'm going to do is I'm going to make this false. Okay. Now when you make this false, the execution will come here by saying okay, it is if and there's a false. That means I'm not going to execute this block. It will come out. It is going to print by. And whatever I said before this is correct. It will only print by. It is by. So yes, I'm correct. You know how I know I'm correct? because I've done the same code before making this video. So I know it works and if you are using certain ids the ids which supports all these things if you observe this the color of this print is different from this print. You know why it's not because it is part of if it's because it it is part of a if block which always check false. Uh if you make it true then it will show its true color. I mean it shows its actual color. Uh pun intended. Yeah it was. Anyway, so if you run this, it will print even and buy. Now you got to know why this particular spaces or tab is important. So I'm going to remove this or maybe I can just keep it here. I will just cut this part and keep it somewhere down because I want to say bye at the end. It's a good gesture. Okay, but then this is true and false and it doesn't make sense, right? Why you will put a certain statement which is always going to execute. When you say true, it is always going to execute. So true is not something you want to put here. you want to put a condition which will result in true or false. So I can say numbum. Okay. How do you check if it's a number even or odd? Now if you go back to previous videos, we have talked about different operators. One of the operator is this mod operator or the percentage symbol. And you can say num mod 2 or num mod num mod 2 which is num divided by two. But it will not give you the quotient. It will give you a remainder. And we just have to compare that with zero. Simple stuff, right? If this is zero, it is going to print even. As simple as that. Okay, let's try this. Let's go back. Run. And it says even. Okay, it still says even. But how do I print odd? Now that's odd. Um, okay. So, what if I put this odd? If I remove this comment here, it is going to print odd anyhow. But I want to print odd only when is odd. So what we can do is we can put if and you can say num mod 2 equal to equal to 1. So we are checking for even we are checking for odd and let's see if that works. Okay. And we have to make sure that you give those spaces. Again it's not compulsory to use one tab or four spaces. You can give also give one spaces that that works. But you know when you build projects it will be used by others your teammates. Maybe you are making it open source. the world is going to say it and you don't want them to be uncomfortable looking at one space there. So let's make this as a standard let's go for tab. Okay. Or if you love your space bar or if you hate your space bar you can hit your space bar four times. Whatever works for you. And now if you try to run this it says even. But if I change this number to five it should print odd. Otherwise I'm going to close this video. Yeah it says odd and I'm not going to close this video. Eventually I have to. So basically what we're doing here is it is checking if this number is I mean number two is zero then it is printing even. So if block or the suit will execute only when the condition is true otherwise it will not execute. Cool. So that's how you do even odd. This is not the best way to check if the number is even odd. But yeah it works. Now we know how to use if. But when I say it is not a best way. What's the other way? Let's find the other way in the next video. [Music]"

So it's quite simple. Instead of taking the input or assign the value there, let's take the input. How do we do it? To print something, we were using a print function. And to take the input from the user, there should be a function. And logically, the function name should be input. And yes, the input the function name is input. So we'll say input input, not input input. Okay, that's bit confusing. So we got input input and uh so this one this first one will take the input for a the second one will get the input for b things should work out. So now let's try waiting for the input six and four swapped. That's how you take the input right? So simple and that how you end the video. It's only been 1 minute. See the thing is uh the video should not be that small. When you ran this for the first time let's go back here and run this. As a developer, you know that you have written input there and it is waiting there to input. But think about it from a user perspective. For the user, it's a glitch. It's a bug in your application. It got stuck. It's not doing anything. It is not printing anything. Nothing is happening there. So you have to let your user knows hey we are waiting for your input. And the way you can do that is by passing function as a parameter. So you have to say enter the first number and you have to give some space here. So that when it prints on the screen, there should be some space for you to enter. And then here we'll say enter second number. As simple as that. And then we give a space. Now if you break it and run it again let's run this. And you can see now it prints something. So now as a user I know okay it says enter the first num. I will say five. Enter second num. Okay I will enter six. Swapping. Done. Right? That's how basically you can use the input function. Cool. Right? Now let's say instead of swapping them I want to add them. That will make much more sense. So let's let let me remove this and let's add. So I will say C is equal to A + B and then at the end I will also print C here. Let's see what happens. Let's clear this and enter. Okay. Asking for the first number. Let's say five and 7. Okay. Something went wrong. I was expecting 12 but we got 57. Why? We are asking for the input from the user. User is inputting five and seven. We are even adding them. Nothing looks wrong here. See the thing is when you look at the input as a function is a inbuilt function, right? And this is how it is defined. All this are inbuilt functions. Input is a function which takes something from you and it returns the string. And that's what is happening here. Whatever you your input is giving you, it's a it's of type string. And when you add a two string it gets concatenated. Now we want to add them. And this is where what you have to do is before you add them you have to convert them into integers. So what you can do is you can say int a. So you can take the value of a and convert it into int assign to a. Same thing you can do for b. And now this will basically convert that into numbers. And now when you run this let's say five and seven you got 12. Okay. So important thing to remember is you basically have to convert that into numbers if you want numbers by default it will give you string. Okay, that's for this particular thing. Let's say you're not asking for a string let or a number. Let me remove all this thing here. Let's say you're asking for a character. So enter a character. And when you do this when you take into a variable a and when you try to print a here let's see what happens. list character u it works let's take y u it gives you y u what you wanted is only y right now the thing is input by default give you string doesn't matter what you enter it will give you that so in case if you just want to print the first character you can use you can do that right slicing we have done in the earlier videos of the course if you run this and if you say y or u it will just print y But it it is taking everything and it is storing everything in a. So even if you enter a huge string enter it prints a. But don't you think you're wasting so much of memory that you're storing in a what if you only take the first character. So you can write that here as well. So it doesn't matter how much you take from the user. Let's say this much. Enter. You will only get L one character. Okay. So, yeah, some tweaks to show you what you can do with the input function. Uh, but now you know how to take the input from the user. We're happy. See the next video. [Music]"

We got a equal to 5 and B equal to 6. So we got these two variables, simple variables, no fancy stuff. And now I want to also print this. Let's print this first and then we'll see. So here I'm saying a colon, a print b colon and b. Okay. So we got these two variables assigned and also printing it. So let's run this and you can see whatever value assigning you are just printing it. Now what exactly swapping means? Swapping simply means the value of A and the value of B need to be swapped. So A should get six and B should get five. Now why this is useful? Uh when you build application and when you want to process data sometimes swapping is important and also when you want to sort. So there are different sorting algorithms available in which those thing works when you swap variables or swap values. So let's see how do we swap. Normally if you want to think um as a human what we do is we say okay let a get the value of b and let b get the value of a and this should solve the problem right uh but let's see let's try so I will just clear this and run and you can see okay something went wrong both are six why so if you go step by step what is happening is in this two lines we are assigning value no problem with that here we are saying a is equal to b that means the value of B which is six goes into A. That means the new value for A is six. Okay. And then in the value in in B we are assigning the value of A and the new value of A is six. So both are getting six. We are losing five here. So this is not the idle way in programming. So that means we have to make sure that we don't lose the value of five. And the way you can do that is keep the value five somewhere. That should solve the problem, right? So let's take C and let's keep the value five there which is in A now. So the value five goes into C. Then the value six goes into A. And now I want the value five to go to B. In that case I will not say B equal to A. I will say B equal to C. Okay. Now we are able to swap. I will show you the output so that you will trust me. And you can see they have been swapped. Things are working fine. But the problem is we are using extra variable. See every bit is important. So when you uh use these two variables they are taking some space right let's say x amount of space when you have two variables you're taking 2x of space and just to swap we are using the third variable that means 3x of the space we are wasting that extra space there. How do we solve that? So let's avoid using the third variable. I will cut that and put it somewhere so that we can refer it later if you want. Okay, let's go back here. Now we'll do the second way. Second way is basically to use mathematical formula. So we have a + b. I will just write it first and then we'll explain what I've done. So this is a mathematical way of solving this problem. Uh what we are trying to do here is we want to swap, right? So when you say a equal to a + b, what we're doing is the value of a is five. The value of b is six. So the addition is 11. Okay? And then the new value of a is 11. Then with the new value of a which is 11 minus b which is six. 11 - 6 is five. The value of b becomes five. Then the value of a which is 11. The new value of b is five. Learn - 5 is six. The value of a which you get is six. So five and six. That's what you got. And that's how basically you swap it. So I will just try to run this. Swapped. Okay. Now what's the benefit of this? The benefit is you are not wasting extra memory for the third variable. Okay, you are saving memory. But for saving memory, we are increasing the number of operations which you're doing. Now, this is where you do the trade-off. Which is more important or which which is less you have. So if you have less memory and better CPU power, you will go for this way. If you have more memory and less CPU power, you will go for the third variable. So none of this is a best approach. It's depend upon your requirement. Okay. So this is another way of mathematical way. But even this has some shortcomings. You know what the five and six they are small numbers right? And this will take less memory. So let's say this takes x amount of bits. When you add them it will increase that bit size a bit because five and six when you add it will it is 11. So 11 will take more space than five and six. So we have one more way which is exord. It normally works with the bitwise operator and it works in the bit bit way. So you you're not losing any extra bit also. Okay. So every bit is important as I mentioned before. So this is six and five. So everything is done. Now whatever we have discussed this is actually the other language way of doing. In Python we have a very easy way. Okay which is a comma b is equal to b comma a. As simple as that. And when I learned my first language for the first time, it was C, then C++, then Java. And every time I I was working with swapping variables, I was like, hey, why can't we just write that in one line? I learned Python bit late. And when I saw this, I was like, this is what I was waiting for. Okay. And now if you say it is swapped, but the question arise how it is working is it not overwriting the values? Example, uh in the earlier case, we were overwriting the value, right? And that's why we were losing the value of a which is which was five. In this case when you assign the value of b to a don't you think we are losing value. So what is happening is behind the scene there's something called tpple packing and tpple unpacking happening. So here when you when you write this it is doing tpple packing. So it will fetch the values of b and a which is six and five. Once you fetch the value it will pack it as in a tpple and then that tpple goes on the on this side. it will do the unpacking of the duple and assign the value which is six and five. Okay, so it's not overwriting it uh in one go. So it is step-by-step process and that's why the swapping is happening here. So that's how you swap two variables in Python. [Music]"

See for different task we are going to create different functions right and we know that now but when you say a task or a group of task normally what you do is let's say if you talk about calculations now for calculations you might be doing addition subtraction division multiplication that comes under one particular thing. On the other hand, we can talk about let's say logging to a system. So login, log out, maybe creating a new user, deleting the user, those thing comes under one system. On the other hand, we can also talk about e-commerce where you are adding a product, deleting a product or maybe uh adding a product to the cart. Those things comes under one thing. Now, of course, if you want to do individual thing here, let's say add adding two numbers, we get a function. If you want to log to a user, that is one function. If you are doing a checkout of a product on e-commerce website that is one function but all these functions are different right so there there's a grouping of functions which we can create and normally what you do is you take this grouping of functions and put that in one module let me repeat you take that bunch of related functions or maybe functions belong to one domain and put that into one module so what is module you can imagine module as a box in which you have all all the related functions. Of course, you can have an unrated functions, but then why someone will do that, right? So, module will have all the related functions of one particular thing. To give an example, let's go back to this thing here and let's say I don't want to work with add anymore. We can remove it. In fact, let me remove everything. What I want to do here is let's say I want to find a square root of a number. So if you want to find a square root of a number let's say I will say result equal to and in this result I want the square root of this number 25 and we know the square root of this number is five but I want to do that with Python. Now you can write the code for it. Okay, we are expert in Python. Now we are expert in maths. Now I'm getting we into learning phase now. But you can do that. Okay, you can write a code to find a square root of a number using Python. Uh like we did for finding a square of a number. So let's say if you want to find a square of a number four, you can simply say 4 into 4. You will get the square of it. But if you want to find the square root instead of writing the complex mathematical formula here, what I can do is I can use some inbuilt functions. The way we have done with print, we have done with int. All these are inbuilt. In the same way, we got this particular function called sqrt which is inbuilt function. I can use that and I can put my number which is a num and it should give me the square root and at the end I will just print it as simple as that. Okay. Uh let me see if this works. So I'll say Python and demo. py. If I say enter, it's not working. If it is not working, let's stop the video. And done. No, I'm now stopping the video. You can see the length of it. So why this is not working. So I'm saying that this is inbuilt and now it's not working. That means is it not inbuilt? It is actually inbuilt. It's just that this type of functions which are not normally used but yes people do use it. Uh so we don't openly put that to Python. Hey anyone can use it because sometime you don't want to use it. Why it is openly available? See plaint we always use sqrt is a very special function belongs to mathematics right it will be used only when you want to do mathematical things right. So in that scenario we can say okay this is not openly available but this belongs to a module which we can use. Okay. So what is module? A module will have bunch of features or normally functions and this belongs to a module called math. Okay. So if you want to use that module I can say import and I can mention the module name which is math. There are lot of modules available. So if you say import and control space you will see a list here. I hope. Yeah, there are a lot of uh modules here. We got B 64 if you want to perform operations with that. You can use a calendar module. Uh you can use colors. Never used it. But yeah, we have an option. We got concurrent module. Uh important. We got datetime module. In the same way, we got uh math module which we're going to use. And when you say import math, basically you got this module. And then using that I can say math.sqrt. So, SQRT is a function which belongs to math module. So, if you want to use a function of a module, mention the module name dot the function name. I hope this time this will work. If not, we'll stop the video for sure. It worked and now we are not stopping it. So, the answer is 5.0 is because SQ normally gives you float values. You will get 5.0. Yeah, if you want to convert that into int, you can just pass that into int function and it should work. Okay, this is how basically you use a module. Now, of course, we can create our own modules if you want, but at this point, we are just using the existing modules. So, math is a module of which we are using a function and we are able to do the things. And now, of course, SQR is not the only function available in math. There are other functions as well. But this video is not about math. Okay, this video is about module. How do we import a module? That's what we have seen now. In fact, I want to show you one more thing with module. Uh, so let's say in math, basically we got one function which we are using, but we have multiple functions. Right? Now, the moment you say import math, you can use all the functions in the code. But what if you don't want to use all the functions? You want to restrict how many functions I want to import. Also, I don't even want to write this math at the start. I can just remove it. But then Python will not be happy. If you remove that Python will say hey what is this SQRT? So in that case what you do is instead of using this particular statement which you have used here I will just comment it and then you say from math I want to import SQRT. Okay, this is a syntax for importing one or two or limited number of functions. So from math import sqrt. Now you don't have to mention math here and you can see there's no uh zigzag lines there. I can simply try this now and it worked. So yeah, that's about the working with modules. Since we are talking about math, let's check out some more functions. Now math has a few more functions to work with. In fact, if I uh go back here and if I say math dot, in fact for that I have to also unccommend this part and if I check math, there are so many functions. One of the function is seal. Now when you talk about a number let's say a float values example when I cleared my 10th standard the percentage I got is 59.4 now whenever someone asks me normally we do roundoff right and when you do a roundoff for 59.4 four it should be 59 right because you increase the value when it is above 0.5 but I used is to say 60 because I used to always apply seal function so what is seal basically so let's say if you have a floor and seal on top and if you have a value somewhere in between if it is near to the lower value it will go there right that's the roundoff but in seal it will always go to the maximum integer for that range so example if I say seal of 59.4 four and if I try to save that result somewhere so it's a result one equal to and if I try to print the result one let's see what output you get so if you run this you will get 60 okay that's my 10th percentage not 59.4 for because I use seal otherwise if I want to talk about someone else let's say if I talk about my friend at home even if that person gets 59.9 it's always 59 okay so float will give the lowest integer and seal will get the highest integer now why I'm showing you this is because I wanted to show you not my 10 percentage but in math you got multiple functions and that's how you can try out in fact there's one more way of checking documentation uh so let's say I will just remove this line and also if you don't want to write matt dot seal you can also use ma uh you can also import from math import seal so that you don't have to write that here matt seal every time you can just use seal uh one more way to get this if I open terminal and if I increase the size here oh that's huge okay so if I go to python now and there's a function available which is help and in this help you can mention what documentation you need. So I need documentation for math. Enter. And this is the documentation. So if you want to learn about a particular module, you can do like this. Otherwise uh you can also let me just clear this. You can also use help matt specifically you can if you want to understand about seal you can mention that it will talk about what seal does. So se the return of x as an inte this is smallest integer which is greater than x. Okay, that's the documentation. Uh, apart from this, you can also use something called power for finding a power of a value. Example, result one is equal to power of let's say 5 ra to 3. So it will give you 5 to 3 and you can if you want you can just print it here. I don't want to print the square root now. I'm lazy. So if you do that it will also work. So that's how you can find the power. So there are a lot of functions you can try it out. So for every module which going to talk about you can also do that you can check out different functions and use it. One more thing about ID is you know this and this is different color because seal you are not using anywhere so it's a different color. It helps you to understand which function you are importing from the module but you're not using it. So that's a feature you can use. I just want to show you one more thing before you go. Uh let's say don't if you don't want to use this syntax if you want to use import math and everywhere if you want to mention math dot something. So instead of that you can also say if you don't want to use math as a word uh some see it is small but sometime you have a big module name you can create allies of it something like import math as m and everywhere you can use m dot and that should work okay uh just to confirm yeah it works so that's it from math module see you in the next video [Music]"

Now from the first video, we are talking about functions. Right? Now, if you remember, we have talked about uh print and then we move towards int, float and multiple functions. So let's understand what are functions and that's where we're going to start. But then before that I want to shift from or the prompt of Python to uh now of course you can use uh VS code or you can use PyCharm that's your choice. I'm going to use VS code and in between maybe we'll shift to PyCharm doesn't matter right it's an IDE now I have opened IDE which is VS code I just wanted to give you some glimpse of what uh the things I'm going to work with so if you're working PyCharm do that the same thing I'm doing so open VS code or PyCharm uh in PyCharm basically you have to create a project and we have done that in the first few videos now in VS code I'm going to open a folder in which uh I have a folder in documents called Python course. In this I'm going to create my first project and we'll open that particular folder here. Okay. So again doesn't matter what's the folder name is. Make sure that you have your one empty folder and that's what I got here. Now in this folder I'm going to create a file and I will say this is my first file. So or maybe demo should work. So this will be demo. py. Again extension not compulsory but then a good practice and certain places where it will be compulsory. So keep the extension and here I'm going to say print just to test if things are working out. Now I'm saying print hello and since I do have the extension for this py and also the vs code extensions which is uh python here I should be able to see this play button which is run uh for pycharm also when you type the same code with a file you will be g getting an option of running there. So when I run this code, it will be running on the terminal here. And that's what you can see we got hello. Now this is how basically you run the project, right? Uh when you actually work on a project, this is what you're going to do. But since I'm teaching, I don't want to see I I don't want to show all this extra stuff here. I want things clean. Uh the first thing I will do is I will run this code using Python command. So I will say Python and demo. py. Okay, that's one thing. And you can see I got hello. Also I want to hide this path here. There are multiple ways of doing this and I was able to find the simplest one. Uh there are multiple options. You can basically conf you can change the configuration of your terminal or the powershell and permanently you can get rid of this path or maybe you can reduce the path because as you can see uh this particular folder is in python course that's into documents that's into one drive and lengy path. So u to reduce this I have a script with me and a simple script thanks to AI. So I got this script here which is function prompt. Uh this one this is a cly package open. There's a space here then double quotes ps for the powershell uh the arrow and then there's a space and this. Now if you are using some other operating system and some other terminal not powershell I'm not sure about the prompt. So what you can do is you can just copy this and paste this in the AI model and say okay this is for powershell what is for Linux or a shell or different prompts. So check that out. Now when I say enter you can see I got a smaller prompt here and just to confirm I'm into this particular folder. I will also check with the help of PWD which is present working directory and yeah present working directory is first project. So I'm good to go and here if I run this you can see we got the output hello. So that's the basic changes I wanted to make and now once we have this done. So let's try to understand what are functions and why do we need it. See when you are building a project of course in your project you'll be having lot of lines of code till this point we are working with IDLE and then uh basically the prompt and then you are able to enter one line of code and then we were see we were able to see the output and it was fun but then when you build the actual software it will have lot of lines of code and there are certain things certain line of code which you're going to repeat multiple times right now example let's say if you talk about print hello here of Suppose if you look at this code here and we are talking about this from a long time. This print is a function. Okay. And how do we know that's a function? So we have a name for it and then we are open opening this bracket closing this bracket. This is a function. Now why this is useful? As I mentioned before when you have lot of lines of code and if you want to reuse them you can put that in one function. Let me show an example here. So let me remove this part as of now and let me write a code. Let's say I want to add two numbers. As simple as that. So we got two variables. We got A as value five. We got B as value four. Doesn't matter what the values are. And then we got a C variable in which you are basically adding these two values A and B. The value of A is five. The value of B is four. So we know the value of C would be 9. And then here you can print it. So you can go to print and you can say C. Basically you are printing the value of C. I think this is the first time when we writing multiple lines of code in one go. Not like a prompt where you are entering a equal to 5 then b equal to 4 in different lines. Here we have all that in one line. Okay. In other languages basically we put a semicolon there just at the end so that we can define hey that's the end of the line or the statement. But in Python the simple enter works. Okay. Uh even if you say semicolon I don't think there's a issue in Python but and why why do we need extra symbol there? Now this is your code. Okay. Now if you execute this of course you will be getting the addition and you'll be printing it. Let me show you. Of course I can run that here or I can type Python. You just have to make sure that you're in the right folder and you can see we got nine. Now let's say if I have a lot of lines of code maybe 10 or 100 or maybe thousand or maybe 10,000. Okay, it's not a good idea to write everything in one file, but let's say we have lot of lines of code and maybe you want to reuse this code multiple times. So basically let's say somewhere after 50 lines of code you have this code again. So in between you have lot of codes here and after that you got this particular code. Now why do we need this? You have to write this code because we we want to do the same thing again. Maybe you want to add two values again. Now don't you think if you want to write this code multiple times then just write them once and give it a name something like this take this code put that in a box something like this maybe I can just draw some lines here to specify hey that's the box and this box need to have a name if I want to call it again so this is a code I want to put that in a box and call it multiple times or maybe once my wish and we can name this as add block okay that's a block and we got a name for it which is add block. Now since I have a name for it now I can call it multiple times. So let's say in some other file not in this file maybe in some other file I can simply say hey remember that block add just call it. So I will say call add block and this code will execute. It's that fun right? But then if you can see the IDE the VS code is not happy with the statement here is because this is not a Python syntax. This is English. So how do we do that in Python syntax? First of all, you don't give this lines here. Okay, let's put the lines there. First of all, you don't say add a block. That's not how you write a block. You need to create something called a function. Okay, this should be a function. Now, how do you create a function in Python? You use a keyword called def. Defs definition. And then you give this function a name. So I'm going to name it, let's say add. I don't want to think a lot. So add and then you have to give round brackets to define that's a function. Now you have to open the function. This is the opening of the function. This is a closing of the function. But then again Python is not happy. This is not how you create opening and closing. So how do we do it? First of all you need to remove this. This is not how you do it. So how do we do it? Just after the add, you give a colon to define that whatever comes after this is a part of this particular function. Okay. And how do you say that it's a part of the function? You give a tab. So whatever code you need to be a part of this function you have to write that with a indentation. So I'm giving a tab. Okay. So everything now belongs to this ad. So tab the tab is not compulsory. You can also give a space a single space but you have to make sure that you're consistent with all the spacing. So for the first statement if you're using four space which is one tab for the second statement as well you have to cons you have to be consistent. Okay in other languages we use curly brackets to open and close the function. Uh this also looks good but then Python wanted to make it simple. So they have removed the curly brackets. You can just follow the indentation. This is a boon for Python developers because they don't have to type extra symbols. But also sometime it can be confusing. Hey, where is that function starting? Where's the function ending? But you will get used to it. Okay, so once you know the indentation properly, uh you will get used to this things and I got used to it. So that's fine. So this is how you define a function. Okay, at this point I will remove this. Just remember this is a statement I have written. In fact, I can also use a comment there. Uh I'm not sure if you have talked about comment before. A comment is basically a way to write something in the file but you don't want your Python interpreter to interpret. So you can say hey that's a comment. Okay, don't execute this. So in Python we use hash as a symbol to write the py to write the comment. And now once you have done that let me clear this and run it again. In fact you know it looks good if I put that maybe I should keep it here. Enter. And okay there's no error that's a good thing but there's no output that's a bad thing. Now why there's no output because we have commented this. Okay let's uncomment this and say okay call add block but again this is normal English uh is not happy. I will remove this and let's find how do we do that in Python. So to call the function you have to say the function name round brackets and that's it. This will call the function. Okay. Now you might be thinking okay this is a part of the function why this is not part of a function is because if you observe for all this code here all these lines there's a space there's a tab space right four spaces here we don't have any indentation so this particular line is outside the function okay that's something you have to remember and now after making the changes one thing you have to do is you have to save it very important and run and now you can see we got the output nine now it's not that you call it only once. You can call this as multiple times as you want. Add. Add. So write it once. Write this code once and call it multiple times. Not just in this file. You can write it in other files as well. That's cool, right? And now you can see this is calling that three times. So you can call it thousand times. It will call thousand times. Not a good idea. Why? Why someone will do that? But it works. So let's get back to one line of code. And now what else we can do? See every time you call add it will print nine because that's what you're doing. You are you are hard coding the value of a and b and every time you execute this function you will get nine. I don't want that. I want this to be dynamic value. So let's say if someone is calling add and they want to add let's say two and three. Maybe someone wants to add 10 and 20 or maybe big number. So how do I do that? So one way you can just pass the value here. So you can say add I want to pass 2 3. Now this time I wanted to add a 2, 3, not five and four. But if you run this you will get an error. It says okay you are passing two arguments but you are not accepting it. Don't you think if someone is passing the values you need to accept it as well and that's where you have to accept it. So let's say I'm accept accepting that in two variables called X and Y. And again variable name can be anything. So these two values 2 and three will go in X and Y. Okay, now there should not be an issue. Let me just run this once again. Oh, what I'm doing? Let's run this. Okay, there is a problem here. It says we are passing two and three. Oh, can you see that round? I have not saved it. My bad. Okay, now you can see it says nine. But why nine? It should be five, right? See, we are accepting those values here. But we are not assigning those values to A and B. We are still assigning five and four. So let's say X and let's say Y. And now it should be happy. Let's run this. And you got five. That's how you can specify the values. Okay. Now let's say I don't want to print the value here because what is happening is every time you call add, it will add those two values. It is printing it. That's a default definition of it. That's how we defined it basically. But let's say I want it to not print it. Maybe I want to do that do something else with that value. So let's say if you are calling add maybe you want to print it. Maybe I'm calling add I don't want to print it. I want to save that output in a file or maybe I want to save that output in the database. Maybe I want to send that output to a server. My wish. Okay. So here since we are printing it, it will always print it. So I would say hey you know let me decide what to do with that value. So what I want to do is when I call add, I want you to give me the value. give it to me. So I will say result. Now since it will give I have to also accept it. So I will call add and it is responsibility of the ad to give me the value and that value goes into result and I can do whatever I want with that. But unfortunately let's let's try to print it and I will say with the statement I will say result is um I will print result. So I want this to be printed as result is and then the value. But if you run this, you got five here because we are still printing it. And it says result is none. None is because this add function is not returning anything. And that's why you got none. Okay. Uh if you're coming from other languages where we have a concept of procedures, this looks like a procedure where it executes something but not returning. But I want it to return. Okay. And you might be thinking this is not returning anything. It is actually returning something and you know what is that returning? It is returning none. None is a thing in Python which says uh it's none. Okay. So it returns none. Basically what I want to do is I want to return C. So instead of printing it here I can use a keyword called return and I can see. So I mean I can say return C here which is a variable. So when you call add it will add these two values and then it will return the variable which is C and that value will be assigned to result. And now if you see uh it still says none and I'm doing this mistake multiple times. I'm not saving it. And the result is five. It's finally working. So maybe I will if I execute this again I will just copy this code and paste it here. Or maybe instead of saying copy paste we should say code reuse. uh if I pass a different value let's say if I pass five and 8 that should be 13 and you can see we got result is 13 that's how we do it so yeah that's about functions and uh I want I want to show you one more thing I know that's a lengthy video but it's interesting when you look at print it's a function right and somewhere it is defined the way we are defining add function even print is defined somewhere and when you hover on print It specify what the print function is. They have defined it using print name and then it does some things but there's there's a description of it. Prints the value to a string or standard output uh string inserted between values. Okay. So it has a good definition or a description. And if you hover to add, it simply says there's a function called add. It takes two values and returns something. But there's no proper description for this. If you want to provide description, you can put that in triple quote or triple double quote. So you have to open triple double quote and then you have to close it. In between you can say adds to add to values. Okay. And now when you save it and if you hover to add you can see we have added this little description here. Okay. That's all about functions. Again functions is a huge concept. is just that for the upcoming videos where we are going to talk about certain things this topic is important that's why we have talked about functions here that's it see you in the next video [Music]"

In fact, before this also we have worked with the operators like addition, subtraction. But let's see what else we can do. Now, in this video, we'll focus on arithmetic operators and relational operators. There are multiple options which you can perform. In fact, with string also or list, we are able to fetch values. Those are also operations. But then if we talk about arithmetic and relational, they are to be different and we going to see that here. So let's create two variables here. So I will say a is equal to 3 and b is equal to two. Simple variable, simple values. And I want to perform some operations on them. So of course I can add these two values, store it somewhere. But let's say we don't want to store it anywhere. I can simply say a + b. Now what we are doing is we are trying to add these two value. A which is three, two, b which is two. And then when you click on enter, you get the value five. As simple as that. Now apart from addition, we can also do other operations like a minus b which is subtraction. Then a multiplied by b which is multiplication and a divided by b which is the division. Okay. So you can perform all these operations here. Now we have also talked about double slash before which will give you the quotient not the point value. And if you want to get the remainder, you can use mod to get the remainder which is one in this case. So these are the simple operations which you have. Now what else we can do? So let's say I want to add a and I want to increment the value by two. So the value of a is three at this case and I want to increment the value by two. The way you can do that is by saying a is equal to a + 2. As simple as that. And of course this will also give you five. So the current value of a is five. Makes sense, right? But there's a trick here. This is the plus operation or you can say addition. Uh but also we have used one more operator here which is equal to, right? Which is the assignment operator. Now this is not the first time we are doing this. In in fact in the first two lines also we are assigning them right. So three is assigned to A, two is assigned to B. So that's your assignment operator. Okay. But then if you want to perform this operation where if you can see we are incrementing A itself. So can't we just use some shortcuts and yes we do have shortcuts we can say a plus so we want to increment a but but how much so if to say two so we are increment the value of a by two this is a shortcut also called assignment operator uh or in some languages we call shorthand if that makes sense even this works if you say a this is seven now so of course a was five and now we incrementing by two so this is seven in some languages we also use a ++ ++ which doesn't work here. You can see we caught an error. But you can use this short end and if you if you want to increment just by one you can say a + equal to 1 even that works. If you check the value of a it is eight now. So let me clear it. So that's how you can work with the arithmetic operators and assignment operators. In fact for assignment this is a fun thing about Python or amazing thing about Python is if you want to assign values to two variables uh let's say X and Y. Okay. So if I want to x value assign the value of of six to x I can do like this. And if I want to assign five to y then I have to say enter and on the new line I have to say y equal to 5. Can't we just assign those values in one line? And python says yes hold my cup. I should have said something else but I'm not sure who is watching this video. So x comma y or 6a 5. So what we're doing is we are assigning the value of six to x and five to y. And if I say enter, let's check the value of x. Let's check the value of y. And they have been assigned. So that's how basically you can work with the assignment operator. And you can assign two values. Now if you go back here, the operation which we have performed which is a + b, a minus b, those are called uh this plus minus here called binary operators. Now why they are binary is because we got two operants, right? A and b and we got one operator. So this one operator working with two operants. But what if you have a single operent? In this case we can let's say the value of a is 8 and I want to negate it. I want to make it minus. So you can say minus a. It will minus 8. Now this operator here which is minus is applicable only for one operent. So that is called a unary operator. Okay. Uh but again the value of a is still 8. It's just that we are printing it the minus 8. Uh but if you really want to make it minus 8 the value of a you can say a equal to minus a. If that makes sense. Now a itself becomes minus 8. So that's the arithmetic and assignment operator. Let's talk about the relation operators. Now here let's say I got the value of a as four and the value of b is let's say three. So we got two variables and two values. I can compare them. Okay. Now when you compare these two values, you can do that with the help of less than equal to or less than or greater than equal to or just less than or just greater than or not equal to. And when you do that the result type would be boolean. And we have talked about boolean before. Uh let me show you what I'm talking about. So if I want to check if a is greater than b and in this case yes a is greater than b it will return true. If I say a less than b it will return false. So this operations results in a boolean value. Okay. And not just less than greater than we can also try you know in maths we do less than equal to using this symbol. Here we can't we don't have that symbol on the keyboard. So we have to say less than equal to B. And when you say enter it is false. It is not less than and not not even equal to. But what I will do is I will just make the value of B as four. Now A and B both are four. And if I do the same operation again it says true. Now it is not less than but it is equal to. So at least one of the conditions should be true. Uh we can also check for A is greater than equal to B. Now it is not greater but it is equal to. So it will return true. So that's how we can work with the division operators. Also we have one more. I want to check if they're not equal to. So or maybe equal to. So you can say a equal to equal to b. So it will check if they are equal. Now why not single equal to? That the way we do it in maths is because single equal to is for the assignment. Right? So if you say this, this is assignment. And if you want to compare, we have to use double equal to. And when you say enter, it returns true. What if you want to check if they're not equal? In that case, you have to say not equal B. So this exclamation means not. And when you say enter, it says false. It's because they are same. So that's how we can work with the arithmetic assignment and relational operators. Now let's talk about logical operators. First of all, why do we need them? So let's go back to the previous example. We got the value of A as four and B as four. Okay, both are same. uh we should have changed it right so let's make it b as five of course doesn't matter but so we got two values now a is four b is five and now I want to check if a is less than 10 and I want so of course this will be true and b is greater than one and this is also true so both are true makes sense but I want to combine them okay so I want to check them in one line so based on these two values I want to do something you know so in programming basically ally when you say your software can think your computer can think it's because of these things right where you decide your path based on what result you get in terms of true or false example should I take the umbrella outside when I'm going it depends upon if it is raining of course I have to take the umbrella or maybe it's a rainy season I will take the umbrella or maybe I'm not even going to the office I'm going to play cricket so why do I need an umbrella I want to enjoy the rain while playing cricket so these are the conditions which you check in the same way we got two conditions here right and I want to combine them. So maybe it is if it is Sunday and if I'm not going to office if it is Sunday and if it is raining doesn't matter I will not take the umbrella. So I will take the umbrella only when it is Monday or weekday and it's a rainy season. So if the both scenario is true then only I will take the umbrella. I'm lazy I know. Uh but here if I how do I combine this? So the way you do that is very simple. You just keep that in one line. So first condition, second condition on the same line and you say enter and your Python is not happy. Python says what you doing? This is not how it works. Uh oh, maybe it says we don't do that here. Anyway, so if you want to combine these two conditions, this is not how you do it. You have to put something in between. That's how the syntax works. So take this take these two conditions and in between you say and. Okay, like in English we do that. So this condition and this condition if both are true return true as simple as that right? So that's how you combine two conditions. If it is that simple, why we are making the entire video on it? Because there's a trick. Let's say uh I instead of using and if I use or because we also use that in English sometimes we say and sometime we say or of course we don't use that in the same place based on different scenarios we use them but here also it returns true then which one you should use that depends upon how and and odd works. Now first of all if you are coming from mathematical background you might have seen this before. There's something called a truth table. Now see this condition is true and this condition is also true. So when you when you do a and operation on true and true you get true. This is true and this is true and when you do odd operation on true and true you get true. But what about the other scenarios? Example I will make this as greater than 10. Now B is not greater than 10. Okay. And in this scenario this will return true. But if you do the same thing with and it will return false. So yeah things are different. It's not same because this is true and this is false. Still still your or says true. This is true and this is false and says false. Now to understand this more we have to look at the truth table. Now let's look at the truth table for and first. Now let's say we got two inputs A and B. Let's not use A and B. Let's say use something else. So condition one C1 C2. So we got two conditions and in these two conditions both are true then you will get true. We are talking about and here. So and means both are true then true. If the first one is true, second is false, it will be false. Let's say in the third one, first one is false, second is true, it will be false. And if both are false, it will be false. That's how and works. So only place where you get the true in the output is if both are true. On the other hand, if you talk about or operations, if both the conditions are true, of course, you will get true. If one of them is true also, you will get true. So let's say true false it is true false true it is true false false is false so the only way you will get false is both should be false example let's use or here and let's make this both as greater than 10 then you will get false because both are false so this is how and or works but also we got one more which is not so let's say uh I got result which is true okay so of course if you print result it will be true if to say not result. Of course, you can't use exclamation here. That's only for the relational operators. But if you talk about logical operators, we have to say not. Now, what not will do is not will just reverse it. It will say false. So, result was true. If you say not result, it is false. It will just reverse the condition or the output. So, those are your logical operators. So, that's it from this video. See you in the next part."

In fact we have worked with them before. We have worked with numbers, string. In fact in sequence we have talked about list, set, tpple, dictionary, right? So we have all those things but there are certain extra things which I want to add in this video and of course we'll revise the old concepts as well. So let's say if I want to work with a variable and if I in that variable let's say the variable is x and I want to store a number 10. Of course the type of this variable x is 10 or is int right? So if I say x it's of type int. Remember this this is a class type int. We'll talk about what is class later at this point readed as type int. Now apart from this if I want to work with float values or point values I can say pi value is 3.14. Okay, I did something weird there. Uh, it should be 3.14. And if I try to find the type of it, if I say pi, it is float. So, we got a type int, we got a type float. Apart from this, we have some more types which you can look at. One of it is complex numbers. Now, if you remember, if you go back to your maths concept, we had this concept of complex numbers, which is something like a + b i or i depend upon uh which standard or which book you're referring. But yeah, so we have this complex numbers, right? Where I defines a imaginary number. Now, if you want to define that in programming, the way you do that is not with I but with J. And we can do that in Python. Okay, so let me show you. So let's say if I create a variable called C and if I want to create a complex number, I can say 6 + 8 I. Okay, not I but J. This is something to remember. In Python, we have to say J. If you say I, it will give you error and you can try it out. If I say enter, no problem. And if I try to print C, that's a complex number. How do we know that's a complex number? You can check the type of it. And that is complex. In fact, there's another way of creating a complex number. So let's say if you have these values in some variable. Let's say you got a equal to 2 and B equal to 3. So we got these two numbers. And with these two values, I want to create a complex number. So it should be something like 2 + 3 I. In that case, you can create a variable C. And you can use a inbuilt function in Python called complex and you can pass these two values. You can pass 2, 3 or since you have these values in a variable you can say a comma b and if you try to print c that the complex number now these functions are inbuilt functions and not just complex we got functions like int, float. Now why you'll be using them? example let's say I got this pi value which is pi 3.14 and if I want to store that in a variable and I want to make it type int let's try that so let's say the variable is k and in this I want to store the value of pi but in the integer format so if you say pi then the k becomes a float value because pi is float now if you want to convert that into integer you have to pass that pi value in the int function this is the in function which will take a value and convert that into a integer value. Enter. And if you say the type of k it is int. But what will be the value of it? Since we are converting this number into integer, you are going to lose some data. And what data you're going to lose? The point value. So if you try to print k, it will be only three. On the other hand, if you have a integer value which is k in this case and if I want to create a new variable let's say p and I want this p to be a float value and the value should be coming from k which is of type int. So if you say k of course the p becomes int. Now in that case you have to convert that into float by using a float function. And now if you check the type of p it's of type float and yes if you try to print p it will be 3.0. Now all these are numbers. We can also work with string which we have talked before. So if you say a name and if you say a name is Naven and if you check the type of this name it will be string. So we have talked about this. This is just a revision for you. The only new thing I think was about uh complex numbers. But in numbers we got one more thing which is of type boolean. I know boolean would be true and false. Why it would be integers or numbers? Uh let's check that out. So let's say if I try to create a variable let's say a is equal to 7 and b is equal to six. We got these two values and I want to check which is greater. So I believe that a is or b is greater than a which is not the case but you can believe anything right? So if I say greater equal to and I can use an operator here and I believe that uh b is greater than a which is false but in my mind it's true. And let's try to print it. And that's false. I am wrong and I'm happy with it. So this is false, right? Because B is yes, this is smaller than A. And this is a boolean value. So false is a boolean value. And we got two options only. We got true or false. Example, if I convert that from less than then, greater than. So we change it to less than now and it will be I have to print it also. It will be true. So we got two options. We got false and we got true or true and false. In fact, you can directly store these values to a variable. I can check is it okay doesn't matter is it true and if I try to print is it it says true okay so you can assign the values not just true or false I mean not just true it can also assign false now why I'm saying these are numbers few minutes ago it's because you can convert this boolean value into numbers example if I say k is equal to and if I say true of course the value of k would be true but what if I try to convert that into integer what will happen if I try to print the value of K it is int. The same thing happens when you do that with false it is K is zero. So true is one and false is zero. This is something you have to remember because we're going to talk about this in the upcoming sessions or videos. So that's the boolean type. Apart from boolean type we also got something called none. If you're coming from other languages we got something called null there. But in Python we got none. Example I can say result is equal to or maybe I will say result. And if I try to print result, we're not getting anything. But if you try to print it, I just hope it will print something. And it prints none because there's no value assigned to it. And you can manually assign the value which is none. Even that works. If you try to print it will be none. Now let's shift our focus to sequences. So we have worked with list and okay let's say L and in this L if you say four five any value this is this is a type of list and if you try to find the type of it is list. Apart from this we also got something called tpple. So we'll just change that square bracket to round bracket and if I say t and if I check the type of t that's tpple uh we can also create a set and if I say the type of this s that is set and we have also work with the dictionary right but apart from this we got one more way of creating a sequence and that is called range. So how do we create a range? So you say range uh let's assign the value somewhere. Let me assign that to r. So range and I will assign let's say 10. Now this R is a range. If you print R, that's a range. And if you try to find the type of it, it's a type range. But why you will reuse something called a range here. So first of all, range is a function which takes a parameter and uh it returns a range. But why do we use it? See if you want to create a list. Okay, so something like this. If you want to create a list and if you pass r in this list, see what happens. Okay, it creates it gives you a error. Let me try with set. Maybe I have used list as a variable somewhere before doing this. Anyway, so if you try with set, you can see we got this values. Now when you say range, range starts with zero by default and ends just before the number you have assigned which is 10. But let's say if you want to include a 10, then you will say 11. Okay. But now let's say let me just print R. Range is still there and set is still there. Okay. Set I'll specify R. This is still there. But what if I want to print even numbers till 10. So the way you can do that, you can say set and again you will use range inside this. But if you set 10, it will print the same sequence again. So you have to start from two because that's where the even number starts. And then you have to end at 10 because I want to include 10. So you have to end it at 11. But you have to also mention the steps. By default, the step is one. And that's why you can see 0 1 2 3. That's a sequence. But if you want a step of two, you will specify two here. And you can see it is 2 4 6 8 10. Step of two and starting from two ending at 10. And that's how range work. There's another way of using range using loops which we're going to see later. But at this point this thing works. So these are the types which are available in Python which you can use. There are other types as well but these are highly used. See you in the next video.

We have talked about different type of data. So we have worked with normal variables in which we can have numbers, we can have string, we have worked with list, tpple, dictionary, set. Now let's go back to the basics of variable. So what I'm going to do is let's say I have a as a variable and I'm trying to store the value which is five. a simple expression where you're saying a equal to five and we know when you print a it will be five. Now what is happening behind the scene? So we are assuming that there will be a box inside the memory which will be having this value five and the name of that variable or the box is A. Right? That's what we are thinking now. Now when I say B equal to 5 so of course it should make a different box. So there should be two boxes one with name A and one with name B. And if you try to print B, of course it will also print five, right? So two boxes, same value five and five and we got a name A and B. So let's say if you are storing this value in the memory, so of course there should be a address to it. Now when you say you have an address there, I want to print it. How do I do that? May not be an address but there should be some identity to it and that's what I want to print. And that's where inside Python we got this inbuilt function called ID where you can pass the variable which is a and it will print the identity of it and that's what you got here. So this is the huge number but remember the last three digit which is uh 0 56. Let me try it for B. Of course it should have a different ID but when you print it you will get the same value. I mean that's weird. Why two different boxes have the same address? Something like this on the screen. It's a conflict. Right now what is happening is let me try. Okay. So let me explain with this changes. Let me make B with value six. When I do this and when you try to find the ID of a B. So before I do that, what do you think? Are we changing the value of the box from 5 to 6 with the name B? If that's what you're thinking, say this. We got a different address. That means B is not the name of the box. It's basically every box will have an ID and A, B, all those things are just references. But referring to what they are referring to something called objects. Everything in Python is an object. A simple number like five is an object. A name like Naven is an object. A list which have multiple values is an object. Everything in Python is an object. Okay. So what we are doing is those those boxes are your objects and inside this object you got values and all this a b and whatever variable name which you use they are just references and they are referring to it. So in the initial case when you said a equal to five we got a box there with five and it will also check do we already have five in the memory. If you already have five it will not create a new box. It will use the existing box. But since we executed this at the first line we don't have five anywhere. So it will create five and it will refer a to that address. So there should be some area where you have a mapping of the references and the objects. So a is referring to five box. And then when you create B equal to 5 here also we are creating a variable which is referring to a box five. Now since we already have five here it will not create a new box. It will refer to the same box. So A and B referring to the same box and that's why when you try to print the identity of it you got the same values. But what happens when you say B equal to six. Now in this scenario it will say okay I'm trying to save six. I don't see six anywhere. So I need to create a new six box or a box with value six. So it will create that box and that box will have a different ID and that's what you are printing it here. So B which was initially referring to the box five which is referring to box six. Now it's all references. Let me try one more thing. I will create a variable called K and K will be referring to let's say five. Now what do you think? Are we creating a new box of five? No. We have talked about that before. We have the same box of five but K as a new variable is referring to the box five. Okay. So there are two variables referring to box five and one variable referring to box six. Now if I say B is equal to let's say 9. Now we got a new value and if I try to find okay first of all let me print the ID of K. We have not done that. So you can see it is the same value as A. And if you try to print the ID of B, it's a new value now. Okay. So now we got two variables referring to a referring to five which is a and k. We got one variable referring to 9 and there's no variable referring to six. Now what happens to that box six because nobody is referring to it. It's a memory wastage right because you have a box there and nobody's referring to it. So what happens in this case? Now in Python we got something called a garbage collection. So garbage collection is like a mini software which comes to your memory and say okay I want to clean up now which object will clean up clean up. Will it clean up five? No because five is referred by A and also K. Will it clear nine? No because 9 is referred by B. What about six? No one is referring to six. Now in this case garbage will say okay I got this object. Nobody is referring to it. Let me clean it. And that's what it is doing. And the same thing we do in our daily life right? So let's say if you are cleaning a room and if you see a box or maybe if you see a remote lying on a floor you know this remote is getting used for something so it will you will keep it on the table. But if you find a paper which is no one is referring to it you will throw it. So it's all about references. So if if you find an object nobody is referring to it just throw it. And now it's not just for numbers we can also use it for let's say string. So let me create a variable called name and let me have my name there which is Naven and let me create one more and I will say this is name one is equal to and I will say Naven. Now when you try to print the id of name and the id of name one you will find they are similar. So whatever we have talked about here is also applied for the name. So what is happening is inside your memory you got this object called naven and I mean of course you got the object and you got a value nave and there are two variables referring to it and this concept is called string interning. So basically when you create a new string it will check okay uh we got a string pool inside this pool let's create this variable or let's create this data naven if not found and then when you try to do that for the next time it will say okay we already have naven in the pool let them refer to the same object. Why to create new one? There's a fun thing which Python does here. Now this string interning works with the normal data. Right? If you have a small string, it will work when one or two words. But let's say I will just clear this out and let me create a new variable called a and in this a I'm going to create a string. I will say my favorite color is black. That's the first string and even b is the same. Now whatever we have talked about till now I have not changed anything in this text here. Okay, both are same. So of course it should be created only once in the memory. So if you try to get the ID of A, it's this. And if you try to find the ID of B, it's this. And they are not matching. Why string interning is not working here is because string interning works with small words or maybe couple of words but not a string like this. Why is because if you try to store everything in a string pool, you're wasting your string pool memory because it's a small memory. And if you try to put big string, it's of no use. Maybe in normal life, you don't repeat the same string again and again. You do repeat words but not the entire string. But yes, if you feel I got a message which is of 10 words and you want to repeat it, you can do string interning. There's a process for it. uh manually you can ask your Python to say hey you know I want this to be done using string interning it will do it but normally it will not and not just for string let's say if you work with numbers because earlier we have worked with small numbers 5 6 9 what happens when you work with big numbers like this if you say a is equal to th000 and b is equal to th00and now what do you think will it be the same ID or different ID they're different so Even that caches stuff works only for the small numbers not even for big integers otherwise you're wasting memory because you repeat small numbers not the big numbers. So Python is smart in that case. So yeah that's what about uh how your variable gets stored in Python. See you in the next video. [Music]"

Now when you go back to list normally we can have multiple values in one place which is a list. The thing is when you work with list you work with the index values. Example if you see on the screen if you have multiple values and if I want to pick a particular value there I have to use the index numbers. That's good. But let's say if you want to create a phone book, how will you do it? So let's say you got a phone numbers as values and if I want to fetch them, I need the index number. Difficult to find, right? And that's where we can use something called a dictionary which sounds like a dictionary like this. And yes, we got words and the meaning of it. So that's the key and a value pair where you have a word and the meaning. On the other hand, you got a key and a value. That's what we want to do here. something like this. So let's say I want to create a data here. So we can have any values here, right? And then to refer this, we need to use the index numbers. Now when it comes to dictionary, this is not how you do it. You basically need a value which is there, but you also need a key for it. So how will you define that? First of all, you can't use square bracket. We have to use the curly brackets. But now you will say, hey, that's for the set. We can't use it for the dictionary. We can. And if you remember in the video of set we have talked about the curly brackets where we wanted to create the empty set and then the type was dictionary is because this curly brackets is actually for the dictionary which we can use in set. Okay. So this is the set. Now this is not dictionary yet. How you mention this is a dictionary. You have to specify the key for it. Example I can say this is the key which is 0 is the key for 34. One is the key for 35. two is the key for 67 and three is the key for 8 and it works. You can see there's no error. And if I want to fetch a value here, let's say I want to fetch this 67 here. So I have to say two and this will work. Now you'll say hey that's what we can do in list as well. Right? Anyway, we are using index numbers here. See the beauty is this key can be anything but in the case of list it has to be index value. So let me create another type of dictionary here with different values. So let's say this eight is naven, this two is hush, one social and zero is kiran. Now what we are doing is for every value here we are specifying the key for it. Okay. Now when you say enter there is no error. But if you want to fetch a particular value let's say uh this values can be anything. It can be age or it can be okay that's not my age eight but this can be anything. This can be age. This can be role numbers. This can be a phone number. This can be anything. Now if you want to fetch a particular value, I have to specify the key. We can't work with index numbers. Now, so if you say one which is not the index number, right? You can say it says hey uh you are saying one but there's a key error. I'm not find I'm not able to find any key here which is one. So you have to be very specific with the key now. So you can specify okay I want to fetch data with hush. So hush is a key and 67 is the value. You can't do other way around. You can't specify the value and say okay I want to get the key uh in this syntax. Okay. So this is how it works. Now one thing to observe when you say one here of course one is not the key and that's why you got the error here and hush is there and that's why you got the value. There's another way of getting this data. So you can say get data.get and you can pass the key here. So you can pass hush. So get is a function belongs to dictionary and when you said when you do this you will get the same value. So this syntax and this syntax are different but does the same thing. It will give you data but it differs when you are saying get and specify something some key which does not exist. In that case it will not give you error. It will say okay I'm not able to find it. What are you trying to get? Let's do this. Let's try to print and let's see what get returns when it doesn't find. It says none. Okay. So it says none when it's not able to find it. But this is not something I want to show to my users. Right? In that case what you can do is you can say data get and let's say I want to specify a key which exists let's say kiran and alternately of course kan will print 34 we know that but in case if you have this dictionary which is created dynamically where you are not sure what are the keys and values in that case you can have a alternate text where you can say okay not found so if ken is there in the dictionary great you will get the value if not it should print not found when you say enter you got 34 because Kan is there in the list or in the dictionary. But if you try to use let's say one here which is not there in the dictionary or any value not just one even if I say a different name here let's say g of enter you can see it says not found it's because it's not there right god of is not there in the in the dictionary and that's why you got not found let's try something so I want to create this data once again okay the way we have done but with one change let me repeat a key here let's say I want to repeat hush and then I want to repeat a value as well let's 34. Okay. So you can see the value 34 has been repeated. The key hush is also repeated. Now when I do this and when I print data observe something hush is getting printed only once. I mean h is there only once and the value 34 is is two times. That means this keys here this kiran sushil hush nav those are the keys that represents a set. That means a key is a collection of set. So you can say keys are set and the values are list. Okay. Uh and that's why you can see the values are getting repeated because in list we can repeat it. Now with that knowledge if I want to create a dictionary from a set and a value can we do this? Let's try let me create keys here which will be a set. We know that now. And let me have Naven and this and Shik. So we got this keys here and of course even if I repeat the elements it will have unique values and then let's say we have values which will be a part of a list and we can give some values to it and doesn't matter what these values are and you have to make sure that these are matching. So three values three keys three values enter no problem. So we got a set here we got a list here. Now I can create a dictionary let's say dict one and I can combine these two. Okay. So, how do you combine a keys and a value? Now, when you want to combine something, there's a function in build in Python called zip in which you can pass the keys and you can pass the values. Now, what zip will do is zip will this zip will basically take these values and it will combine it. But it will not create a dictionary out of it. So, if you want to convert this zip output into a dictionary, you have to use a function which is inbuilt again which is called dict. And when you say enter, let's try to print dict one. And you can see we got the values. So Hesh is 34. Naven 64, Shamik 87. And things to remember the sequence is not maintained. Naven was supposed to be 34 but 34. So this is something you have to also understand the behavior of uh the set. If you don't want this to happen then you have to use the list here. That should work. So let me clear the screen and let's say uh let me print the data again just to see if the data is there. Yes. What if I want to remove the element? In that case you can say data dot pop. So there's a function called pop inside the dictionary and you can specify the index value here. So let's say I want to remove uh naven from here. So I can say that and delete it returns the value of naven. But now if you print data nav is not there. Not just this you can also use dell which we have used before and you can specify the dictionary. But this time you have to say something like this. this syntax social and now I hope social is not there okay so kij hush both 34 in fact you can also have a dictionary inside dictionary something like this let's say I want to create data and I want to get a new dictionary now and let's say this time we are going for the programming languages the programming languages with the ids so let's say for javascript we use vs code for python I'm going to use the list because for python we can use VS code or we can use PyCharm and for let's say for Java. Now the thing is for Java for different modules of Java we use different ids. Example let's say if you want to work with uh core Java use something else. So I can use a dictionary here and I will say for core Java I'm going to use let's say VS code and when it comes to spring let's say I'm going to use intellig idea. Okay. Okay. You know that's a big code I mean big uh dictionary and when you say enter there's no error if you print data this is what you got. Now let's say if I want to know about JS of course I can say JS here there should not be an issue it says VS code the ID when it comes to Python it will give you a list then you can specify okay I want to get one value and it will give you VS code. Now when it comes to Java you got a dictionary. Now if you want to be specific okay I want to work with spring in that case you can say java and you can say spring it will say intellig idea. So that's how basically you can work with dictionary. So dictionary can have a l dictionary can have a dictionary inside it. And yeah that's all about dictionary. So that's it from this video. See you in the next part. [Music]"

Now this comes under sequence. Now we got one more sequence which we can work with is called set. Now if you go back to maths in maths also we have this concept of set. Now what is set? Set is basically a collection of values. Okay, there's a collection here. Set is the collection of unique elements. Okay, let me add one more thing. set is a collection of unordered unique elements. Okay, what do I mean by that? So what I'm going to do is let me create a set to show you. So I will say set one equal to and let me assign the value. Now to assign the value, how will I do it? What kind of bracket I'm going to use because we have to put multiple values. Of course, we can't use square bracket. That's for the list. We can't use round brackets because that's for the tuple. Okay, so we only left with one which is the curly brackets. But and also if you talk about maths when you try to create set that will represent a set you use curly brackets. Now in this I'm going to say 23 uh 56 78 21 and let's say 56 again. Now when you say enter of course there should not be any error and there's no error. But then before I print this let's repeat that statement once again. So set is the collection of unique unordered elements. So when I say enter you can see I mean before entering you can see there are 256 values when I assigned it but when I say enter 56 is only once. Second the order is not maintained. If you can see 23 is at the end now 21 is at the second it should be at the second last position. Then 56 is only one and that come came in first. Then 78 moved here. Now you might be thinking there might be some logic to it. Some sequence because of which it is following is not ordered first of all because sequence is not right is not sorted because it's not in sorted order. Then what's the scenario? See there's a reason we use set and you will understand that reason in the next video. But then set normally stores the value in different different way the way list and double works. Now what happens is every value in a set goes through something called hashing. So what we do is we take the value doesn't matter is it number or string or anything it will take the value it will do the hashing operation on that and it will give you the hash value. Now based on that hash value it will store the elements in that fashion. So it's not stored based on the numbers you mentioned here. It is stored based on the hash value. Now why hash value? It helps you to speed up the process of saving and fetching. Okay. So set is used there. Okay. Okay, so that's why it is unordered and it only supports unique values. Cool. Now, what are the things you can do with set? First of all, you there's a keyword which we have used before. So, let's say I want to check if 21 is there in set. Oh, okay. So, I've entered wrong value. Yeah, that's true. But if I say 22, is it in set? No, that's false. So, this is one option you can do. What else? Let's try to say set one. Or maybe let's try to do length not count. So I will say length of set one. You know count will not work is because it is unique element. So there's no number of occurrence there. But length is there. So length works with four. Now let's say I want to check if the what is the type of set. So I'm just trying random things which we have done before. So the type of this set is of class set. So there we have done for the list and tuple. So we have different types there. So this is set. But let's say I want to create the empty set. So the set without any value. So I will say set two is equal to. Now what do you think? How do I create the empty set? So in this basically what we have done is we got values here. But if I keep the values like this and if I say enter there's no error. But if I try to find the type of set two you can see it says class dict. So d stands for dictionary. So this is of type dictionary not the set. But why? In the upcoming videos we'll focus on dictionary as well. So and we'll know that this is how dictionary is defined. So how do you specify this set? Now in that case we have to use a function of set. So I will say set two is equal to. So there's a function called set. And if you keep it empty and now if you say type it is set. So this is a empty set. So if you try to print this this is empty. There's nothing there. But let's say I want to specify some values. So I will clear that first. And this is set two. Let's say and in this I'm going to assign some values. And the way you can do that is of course with the help of set or you can put curly brackets and you can put the values. Let's say I want to have a collection of characters here. Something like this. So I got A B C D M N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N O O P that's one and then set three is some other set. Let's say wobbles A, E, I, O, U. And let me add something extra PD at the end. Enter. Now we got two set. Let me also print them. And you can see these are the values and it's not ordered. Okay, it is printing randomly. I should have repeated some value here but that's fine. You can see we got unique elements here. Now if you remember something in maths when we worked with set we used to create when diagrams. So there used to be union of a set or intersection of a set. Uh there are different symbols which we can use and we can do that here as as well. So let me try the first one which is set one minus set two and let's see what happens. Oh sorry I'm using the wrong things. It's not set one set two is set two minus set three. Now when you do that you will observe when you say minus here it is removing all the characters from set two which is there in set three. So if you start with A, A is removed because that's here. B is still there because there's no B here. C is still there. D removed because we said D here. Then M is there. N is there. O removed. And P removed because P is there. So that's how minus works. Let's change the operation here. Let's say pipe. And if you observe everything is there either in the set two or set three. So A is there, B is there, C is there, D, MN, O, P is there, A is there, E is there, I is there, O is there, U is there. Okay, everything is there. So this is the all the values of set 2 and set three. Let's try with and. And with and it will only print the common one. So a is common between these two. Then p is common, d is common and a is common. So those are the common things. Let's try one more. So instead of pipe we will be using the carrot symbol. And this will print things which are not common. So a is removed, b is there because that's not common. C is there. C should be there. Uh d is not there because that's there in both the set. And that's how basically you can use this operations. In fact there's one thing which I missed in the tpple video. So in tpple basically let me create tpple once more and if I assign the value. So let's say I want to get a tpple of one element. How will I do that? So of course I can say 45 but if I say enter and if I say type of tpple uh it says int. It should be tpple right? It's because you only have one value. It ignores the brackets there. So in case if you want to have a tpple of multiple values or one value you can give 45 and comma then it knows that that's a tpple. Okay, this is something I've left with. So yeah, we have talked about list, we have talked about set, we have talked about tpple and that's how this thing works. So let's see in the next video. [Music]"

So let's try tpple and let's see what it does. So I'm creating a variable called top or tube doesn't matter what you call it. uh in this if you want to store multiple values the way you can do that is let's say 23 for uh 45 45 67 and 43 now when you create a list we have used a bracket which was the square bracket right and when you do that so this is your list and how do I know that of course with not the name there name can be anything but there's a function in Python called type now when you say type and when you mention a value there or a variable which T in this case and when you say enter you can see it says class list again what is class we'll talk about that later but this is of type list now if you want to create a tuple how do you do it there are two options one you can remove the brackets and keep it empty like this now this is also a tuple when you say enter and when you check the t again or the type again okay now that's rhymes okay so when you see the type it is tuple okay Now there's one more thing which I've did. Now when I clicked on the up arrow I can see the launch commands. Normally this is how you do in the command prompt or the terminal. But in the ideally you will not get that support by default. So what you do is you go to option click on configure and there's option of keys here. In this if you scroll down there should be history next history previous. Make sure that you change these options. And once you do that you can click up and you will get the last command or last history basically. So that's one you can keep this number without specifying any bracket or you can keep a round bracket both works and when you enter again when you check the type it is touble. So that's how basically you can create a tuple and the way you have done in the list you can do that those things here example let's say if you want to find the minimum value out of this thing uh it's 23 which is the first value and when you say max you will get 67. So these things works you can also do sum here. Now what is difference between tpple and list here? Now when you said list before you used to get multiple options right we had option of remove pop then we have also seen uh append insert. Now you you can do those things because list is mutable that means you can change the values or you can change the elements of it. Now in this case when you say top and when you say dot control space if it is not popping up quickly you can see we got two options. We got count and index. What count does? Count basically checks for the particular number how much occurrence you have of the same number. And second index will give you the index value of a particular value. But there are no methods which talks about inserting or removing. That means tuple is immutable. Let me show you how. So if I want to fetch a particular value, let's say I want to fetch this 67 here. The way you can do that is by mentioning the index number. Again we have to use square bracket whenever you want to use the index value. That's something you have to remember. And when you do that you will get 67. Straightforward. But if you try to change the value let's say if you want to have the 65 and when you say enter it will not work. It will say touble object does not support item assignment. That means you can't change the value or the elements of a tubble. There's something you have to remember. It's immutable. Now why this immutability and mutability is important? Now once we go in the upcoming sessions when we talk about different topics I'll mention hey you know this particular type or the structure supports only mutable data or it only supports immutable data. So you should know which is mutable which is not mutable and when you work on a project and if something is not working the value is not getting changed you should know okay this is tpple I can't change the value. Uh so those are things important and that's why this immutability and mutability make sense. Now apart from min max or type function we can also use a function which is length to check the length of a tpple and it says four because you got four values here. So there's something you can do. Apart from this we can do one more thing. Let me say uh top a is equal to. So that's the variable and in this let me have some values and it's not just you should have a value of the same type. It can be of different types. Example I will say two here and I will say nave and maybe I can have 7.9 as a float value. When you say enter there's no problem. If I try to print up a you got all these values. Now there's one beauty about Python as being easiest language to work with. When you say this value which is t a has all these values we got two nave and 7.9. What if you want to store this value in a particular variable so let's say I want to store this two in a variable num. The way you can do that is by saying top a you can give a square bracket and you can say zero. So with the zero index this will be picked and it will be stored in num. There's no problem with that. But what I want to achieve is I want to have three different variables for num for num I mean for two for my name and for this value. So I can say num comma I can say name comma and I can say num one another value. Now what will happen is all these values will go into this variables and if I want to show you how if I say num you can say num is two if I say name it's naven and if I say num one it is 7.9. So this is more of a unpacking sequence because we are unpacking the stuff here into the variables and this is the beauty of Python. It makes things very very easy. There's only one thing you have to remember when you do this operation which I have done just now. So this particular operation let's say if you try to fetch one more thing which which is num two. Now will this work? Logically it should not work is because we got one one value two value and three values. So in total we got three values here. So the length of this tube A or T A is three and the variables you're trying to assign here is four. Now at this point Python will feel bad and it will give you some bad words by saying what you doing? It says not enough values to unpack. Expected value were four and got three because in top a in your pupil or tuple you got only three values. So now we know that tpple is immutable but let me show you one thing where you can make it mutable. So let's say okay not mutable in that sense but let's see the out example. So let's say I'm creating a new tpple which is tpple let's say this is B instead of two so that you will not get confused with numbers and in this I'm going to have some values let's say 34 is the first value then my name Naven and then I'm going to have let's say a list of values okay and that's right you can do this you can have a list inside a tpple in fact not just list inside a tuple you can have a tpple inside the list you can have a list inside the list you can have a tpple inside a tpple so because those are those are types Right? And this is actually one element. So for a collection of values, this is one element. So for the double this thing 34 is one element. Naven is one element and this is one element. Now with this thing if you try to change let's say if you try to change the first value to 24 of course it will give you some bad words. It will say what you're doing no this will not work. Makes sense? And if you do that with the list as well, if you try to assign a different list or different value al together or different type of data all together, there should not be an issue. I mean of course it should not work. And with this also it will not work. You can't assign the value. And we have talked about this before. Tpples are immutable. So you can't do this thing. So I'm I'm trying to replace this with this. And it is saying the same thing. But let me try this. I will say TB and if I want to change a value of a list. So let's say in this tuple we got this list and in which I have a value which is let's say five. I want to make this five 9. So I can say top first I have to target this particular list and this list is your index number two. So I say two here and this from this list I want to fetch this five again which is two. In fact let's try to change four because that's into the sum index so that you will not get confused with two and two. So I'm trying to change this four and make it nine. So if you say nine there's no issue. If you try to print the top tpple, you can see it is working. So you are able to store or you able to change the value of a list because that's immutable. Yes, that's a part of a tpple, but you're not changing the double, you're changing the list. So it's just one element which is immutable, but the element inside that list can be changed. I know it might look complex and that's why you have to try by yourself to make a sense out of it. In fact, you can do one more thing. I want to introduce a new keyword here. So let's say I want to check if 34 is a part of this tpple or not. So I can say 34 in tube B. It will say true. True means this is so true and false. Those are the boolean values and it checks. 34 is in tube B. Basically in will check if it is there. If it is there it will return true. If it is not there it will return false. Example is if you try to match Naven in tube B you can see it says false. Now this nav is this nin difference because there's a capital N here. Okay, that's something to remember. Yeah, that's about tpple. And the most important thing is two. One is this learn brackets and second it's immutable. [Music]"

So basically till this point I was opening python in the terminal but now I'm going to use idle and we have talked about this before. So this is one way of testing your Python code or if you are learning Python you can use this. The reason I was using the terminal is because it looks good. The black screen of course I can set it black here. Uh but then the font and other stuff are good there. But ideally provides you some extra features which we're going to see in this particular video or in the upcoming videos. In fact when you open Ideally for the first time it will give you a a white uh light theme and the font will be small. So you can go to options configure ideally and then you can change things from here. U not that difficult. Now once you are here now let me create a list. Now first of all why in this world we need a list. See when you talk about saving a number if you want to store a string it is very easy right? You can simply take that value and store it in a variable. And we have done that before. Example let's say if I want to store a number I can create a variable which is num one. And in this I can store a number let's say 65. It is so simple. If I say enter and if I try to print num one it will print it. But what if you have multiple numbers? In that case, we can create a variable nums. Of course, name doesn't matter. But here, let's say I'm going for a variable named nums. And in this, I want to have multiple values. So, let's say 45, 87, 21, 24, and 99. So, we got all these numbers here. And I want to store this in one variable. Even if I say enter, it will work because it's a different data type which we're going to talk about later. But, uh, if you want to create a list, okay, so what is list? List is basically a collection of values. So I'm going to put that in this square bracket. So when you have this values in a square bracket and you saw some little animations there, it completed the list. So that's one list with five values. And if I say enter, no error. Everything is happy. And if I print nums, this is your list. It's that simple. Okay. So whenever you want to have multiple values, we can store that in a list. Now what if you want to, of course, when you wanted to print everything, you did that. But what if you want to print a particular value? Let's say I want to fetch the first value. Can we do this? Now, if you go back to the concept of string which we talked about in string, of course, it's a sequence of characters or a bunch of characters coming together or I can say collection of characters coming together. And if you want to fetch a particular character, of course, you can use the index numbers. Here we can use the index numbers. How? So I will say nums and in this square bracket again I have to mention the index number. Okay see you have to remember where where to use square bracket where to use round bracket and that's all about programming. Okay. Uh programming is fun. It's more English. It's just that you need to remember which bracket to use where. So when we use list we have to use square bracket. In the upcoming videos we'll see some other data structures which will have some other type. Okay. So we got nums of zero and if I say enter we got 45. Yes, you can also print the 99 here. So I can say nums and maybe I can use the index number five. If you remember this is one of the issue with index numbers start with zero. We got five values. So index number if I say five of course it will give you bad words. It will say stay in your limit uh in its own way. It says least index out of range. Okay. So I know the last index is four and this will work. But you know since I was not sure at the start what will be the last index value. I said five and I'm saying four. It is working. But can we use negative values? Remember in string we have done that. So here if I say minus1 it works right. So this is the advantage of using the positive and negative index values. Now we can also do slicing here. Now if you remember in string also we wanted to print a specific section of a string. Now that is called slicing. Now in this example let's say we got a list here and out of this list I want to print the last three values or maybe last two these two values 21 and 24. So the index number is two here for 21 and then index number three. This is what I want to print. So I can say nums and then I can specify from where I want to start. I want to start from two and then I want to stop at three. So we have to say four because four is excluded. And if you say enter, we got those two values. Okay. So this is called slicing because you're getting a slice of a particular list. Okay. What else we can do here? Uh can I print from 21 to 99? Yes, we can. So the way we have done it. Okay. So when I say up arrow it is not printing. I think I have to do some setting for that. history previous is alt p okay okay so if you want to get the previous value it is alt p that's what I got to know from the configuration and if you ignore this if you say two colon it will go till the end is that easy till this point we only had the numbers what if you want to have different data type yes you can do that it's not just about uh okay you can't even clear it here that's one tricky part but uh okay let me do it uh you by giving enter so I will say names. So I want to have a string array here or string list here. So I will say naveen. So you have to make sure that you put the single code there and then you will say let's say h then you give a comma you will say kiran. So you got all these values and if you say enter and when you try to print names you got all the values. It works right and not just the names of course you had string here you had numbers but we can create a separate list which will have different values so let's say I want to have a name here then I want to have 67 as a number then maybe I want to go for float value as well 6.5 so you can have different type of data in one list there's no restriction that it is homogeneous where it only has one type of data so if you say enter and if you try print makes it works. Okay. So this is the beauty of list. You can have mixed values. So we got integers, we got I mean we got numbers, we got string and we also got a mixed value. Uh but can I create the mixture of nums and names? I mean I want to have this list. So this is first list. This is second list. Can I can I combine that in one list? Okay. So when I say combine, there are two meanings of it. So I will say mix here and in this mix I'm just using the same variable again. I can say nums and I can say names. Now what I'm trying to do is I have two list nums and names and I'm putting that inside a list. So this is list inside the list. So when I say enter there's no error. It is working. So when I say mix, you can see we got the mixed values. You can see it is starting from here and it is ending here. That's your list. And inside this list, we got two list one and two. Now why this is important? So let's say if you try to print the first value of a list. If I say mix zero, what do you think which one will print? Now this is tricky right now. If you think this is going to print 45 because that's the first value. No, that's not the case. It is printing the entire list of numbers. reason if you say the size of this mix. Okay. So if you try to find the length of this mix you can see the size is only two that means we only got two elements in mix. This is the first element and this is the second element. So the entire list here is one element. Okay. And then you will say okay I want to fetch this 45. How will I do it? That's fine. You can say mix and then you can specify okay I want to get the first list which is this particular entire list here and from this list I want to get the first value. So then again you can write a square bracket and you can say zero. So it will print 45. What if you want to print let's say kon here. So in this case you will say mix and inside this you will specify okay from the mix list I want to get the index value one and from this index value one I want index value two. So you can say two enter and you got ken. So this is how basically you can have a list inside a list. In fact if you remember we talked about mixing these two list. So of course we got that we got one list inside this we got two list. But what if you want to create single list which will have all the values in that case you can say mix equal to nums plus name. So if you want to combine the values you do this and you can see all the values are combined now. So let's see what else we can do with list. I have restarted this window. So I have entered this value once again. Nums and names. And of course I can print this. But before I do that, I also want to create mix which is the combination of nums and names. And if I try to print mix, this is what we got here. So what I'm trying to do now, now when you check let's say nums and if you say dot and this only works with the ideally the moment I say dot it will take some time maybe 2 seconds and it will pop up some functions there. So these functions are operations which you can do with your list like you can do append. Of course in the post we'll try to zoom it so that you can see it. So we can say append, clear, copy. I don't want to clear now because I will lose the value. Uh copy, count, uh extend, index, insert, pop, remove, reverse, and there is also sort at the end. Okay, so we got all these functions here. Now we'll start with append. Now what is append here? So append takes a value from you. Okay, that's what it says. So let's say I'm going to add title three. Now what will happen is we got the nums with all these values. When you say nums do.append 33, it will add that value in the list at the end. Okay. So if you say enter and if you try to print nums, that's what you got. You got this value 33 at the end. Uh okay. So apart from append, what else we have? So we can say nums dot. So let's try to explore the other methods. If the pop-up is not coming, you can even say control space. It will be quick. Then you can also use something called count to give you the count of values. Oh sorry. So when you say nums dot count and you have to mention the number. So let's say I want to see how many times 14 occurred. So when you say 14 it says one and if you use a different value here. So let's say 15 and there's no instance of 15. What else we can do here? So I will say control space. I can even find the index of a particular value. I can insert a value. Now what's the difference between insert and append? Of course insert will also insert the value in the in the list and uh when you say append basically you add at the end but using insert you can insert in between let's say I want to insert a value 55 but I want to do that at index number let's say 1. So what will happen is currently the index number one is 56 here. Now when you say at index one I want to add 55 all this value will be pushed and then 55 will be here. So when you say enter and if you try to print nums you can see we got 55 and then 56 and the entire values. Now if you observe one thing when we were trying to work with string and when we were trying to change the values or the characters of a string it was not allowing it because it was immutable. List on the other hand is mutable and that's why you're able to do that. So mutable simply means it is it can be changed. So we are able to change the values of a list because it is mutable. Okay. What else we can do? Now since we can insert or add we should be also able to remove the values. So I can say nums dot remove and in this remove I can pass a value. So let's say I want to pass a value 56. I want to remove 56. I can simply enter that and it's removed. It is not returning anything and that's why it's not printing anything there. But if you say nums now there's no 56. But what if you want to remove not from the value but from the index because here when you say remove we are passing the value right? If you want to provide the index then you can't use remove. In that case we have to use pop and in this you can pass the index value. Let's say I want to remove 45 from here. So this is 0 1 2 3 4. So I can remove four. Now why this word pop? See when you talk about programming we have this beautiful type of data structure which is called stack and Q. So stack is a data structure like list. The difference is stack follows last in first out. So the last element which you have added will be popped out first and that's why it says pop. Okay. It's like you know when you have a stack of books and the last book which you kept will be the first book will take it out. So that's pops and when you say enter now you can see it returns the value 45 and then it also removes it. So if I say nums now 45 has been removed. In fact you can also write pop without passing the index value and you know which one it will remove just we have just discussed last in first out. So the last value will be popped out. In fact we can remove multiple values. So there's a keyword in Python inbuilt keyword which is called dell and you can perform the operations on list with the help of dell. So you can say nums and you can specify from where to where you want to delete delete. So let's say I want to delete uh 14 and 36 these two numbers. So I can start from two and I can say four because four is excluding enter and it is not returning anything. So if you try to print nums so 14 36 have been okay. So it is four is included or no 36 was already removed and now we have removed 14 and 36. Okay. So we only left with 23 and 55. So the list which started with huge amount of values we only got two now. Okay. Now since we are removing the values maybe I want to add a more values here. So let's say let me insert some values. Now to insert the value we can use append. We can use insert. But what if I want want to insert multiple values? In that case we can use something called extend. And in this extent you can pass a list in which you can pass a value. Let's say 44 56 11 and 99. So when you say enter so all these values got added to nums. So if you try to print nums this is what you got. So we have talked about list as a immutable type right? So what we can also do is if you try to print nums here we got all the values right? But let's say I want to replace these two values 44 and 56. So in this case I can say nums and I'm going to replace the index number two 2 3 so we have to say four equal to and then we can replace those values let's say 54 and 76. Now when you do that and if you check the new list we have replaced those two values. So yeah we can also replace a particular value with the help of this syntax here. Okay. Now let's explore some Python inbuilt functions in fact. Okay. So let's finish the functions of list first. Uh so we can also use something called reverse to reverse a list. So when you say reverse and if you try to print the list. So the sequence was 23 55 54 76 11 99. Now it is reversed. We can even do sorting. So I can say sort and if we try to print nums this is what you got. So these are the inbuilt functions of or these are the functions of a list. But in Python we got some inbuilt functions we can use on them which is min. Now when you pass a list inside a min it will basically find the minimum number and when you say max it will of course now you know it will find the maximum number. We can even do sum on this nums which will give you the sum of numbers. Okay. Can I apply min on names because we do have names. There's no issue. It says okay minimum is hush. Now you know how why it is hers because if you go up this is where names and hush is minimum is because namin starts with n kin starts with k and hush starts with h so h comes before n and k that's why okay what about max you now you know you will get naven there but can I do sum on names and python will be unhappy with you what you're doing okay uh cool so these are the things you can do with Python. You can apply different functions and it's cool. List is cool. So that's it from list. We'll talk about other things in the upcoming videos. [Music]"

Now in this video let's try to focus more on string and let's see what we can do. So first of all I will get into the Python mode and I will clear the screen and now let's get started. So the first thing I want to do is I want to work with the string. So of course I will use my name just to promote myself. Uh okay maybe I'm selfobsessed. Doesn't matter. So we got Naven here and then when I enter you got the name the string itself but what if I want two words of course you can put that into a string in single code you can put Naven Tales it works right u there's nothing wrong but what if I got two different string one is naven one is telesco so again there are two string now so this is one string and this is one string so when you do that what happens will it give you bad words? I mean will it give you errors or you will get the output. So when you run this it works. So basically what it is doing is it says okay I got two strings here. One is this one is this written side by side. So maybe my job here is to concatenate it and that's what it is doing. It is basically concatenating these two things and things are working fine. That's cool. In fact, I should have given a space there just to have this type of output. But you got the point, right? So when you got two strings like this, you can simply keep them side by side and it will work. But let's say let's say I got a name variable and in this name variable, I got my name and when I say enter. Okay, so I got a name variable in which I have my name Naven. And now I want to print Naven telescope. So Naven is the same name. I know but what if I want to write the disco here? What do you think? Will it work? It worked before. Before when you had a string lit so this is called a string lit. So when you got two string literal there's no issue but now we got a variable and a string literal. What will happen now? Maybe this time Python will not be happy with you. Python will say what you doing? This is not how you write a variable and a string together. And that's why it says you know this name makes sense. What is this cisco after that? It is a invalid syntax. Now how do we solve this? Pretty simple. You can simply go back here name and then you can say telescope. It's just that you have to tell your intentions here. When you have a variable and a string literal, you tell your intention. See my intention here is to concatenate these two. So Python says in that case give me a plus operator. This plus operator is actually a smart operator because when you give numbers, it will add two numbers. When you give a string, it says okay, I can't add them. I can concatenate them. And that's what it's doing here. Okay. And when you say enter, you can see it came side by side. It's just that I wanted to give a space here. And now it works. So that's how basically you do the concatenation of a string literal and a variable. So now let's work with string as a collection of characters. Okay, what I mean by that? So what I will do is first of all I will clear this. Okay, let's keep it empty. And now I want to have a text as a variable. And inside this let me have a value as talis. Now this taliso word has seven characters right and I will say enter. So basically if I try to print text will print all the seven characters that's a string but what if I don't want to print the entire set of characters or I can say that I want to I don't want to print the entire string. How do you print a particular character here? So let's say I want to just get t out of it or maybe I want to get a e out of it. How will you do it? So let's take text and then you use something called a square bracket here. Now this is kind of a list which we are going to see later. But at this point imagine if you have a string like this it has seven characters as you can see on the screen and each character will be having some number right. So we can count. So example let's say if I have a desk here and in on this desk I got multiple objects I can count. Okay 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8. That's how we are counting right and same goes for this 1 to 7. But in programming we start the number by zero. Okay. So here this the first character is zero index. That's a new word. Now now index we refer to a particular location. So here the T is at zero index. Then we got E. We got one index. L is two index. That's how it works. So the O is the sixth index. But yeah when you call them as what location? You can say first or seventh. But when you say index, it is 0 to six. Okay? And if you're new to the world of programming, this is where people do struggle to work to work with the index numbers. But don't worry, you will get used to it. Okay? There's no easy way of saying this, but you will get used to it. Okay? So you will say uh I want something at this zero index which is the first position. And when you say enter, you got t. Okay. Now if you want to get let's say some other location, let's say if I say three. Now what is your guess? So or not guess it should be accurate right you can see on the screen it is you that's right it was a guess for me because I can't see the screen that's postp production which you can see on the screen okay now if I say six then of course it will be O but what if if I say seven and that's where Python is not happy Python says hey stay in your limit I mean it says string index out of range because you're going outside the range the range is 0 to six that's what the text here and when here says seven basically you are looking for the eighth location this which is not there so it says string index out of range index error and it's important for developers to read the errors as well just because something went wrong you will say hey let me just check the code again no first check what's error is okay now I know I'm I'm out of bound or out of range I can just come back and okay I will fetch six that's what we can do now this is how you go with range but can we try a negative range here so let's say Uh I want to try with minus1. So guess what it could be in your mind. And now let's see. Uh if I enter it says O. Okay. Now that's weird. Why it says O for minus one? Because see if you try to understand the normal range the T starts at zero. So before this there should be empty, right? It should say out of range. It's not doing that. It is for minus one. And it is saying O is because the string in Python it allows you to have 0 to the plus index like six here also it can allow you to have minus index which is minus1 minus2 as you can see on the screen and it is helpful you know why because when I was doing with this six text six in my mind I was still calculating uh even if I know this I've done this multiple times but still somewhere in my mind I have to be very accurate with what is the index for this O and that is six. But let's say if I don't want to get confused, I want to get the last character, I can simply say minus one, it it will give me last character and then -2 is second last, -3 is third last and that's how it goes. So it is helpful in that scenario. Now if you set text of minus 7, it will be t because that's the first character. But again, if you try to do minus 9, it will say the same thing. You are going out of range. Okay, so let me print text again. Now let's try something else. I want to print the let's say US KO. I just want to print USKO. Now if you do that I can simply say text and from this taliso I want to fetch the last four characters. That means I want to skip the first, the second, the third which means index zero, index one, index two. So I want to skip this three. So I have to start from three and then I have to end where? Okay. So end should be the last value which you want plus one. So the last value which I want here is US KO O is six. I have to say seven. Enter. And you can see we got US KO. Now why seven? If you are wondering is just that it will exclude that particular value. Okay. It will include three. It will exclude exclude seven. Let's say I want to get the first three characters. Now you help me. So it will be text. And you might be thinking how you're helping me. That's all mind power. you think that I will get you know in the past because I'm recording now okay such a weird example anyway come back so if I say zero and I have to start with zero right because I want to include t so we're trying to print tel so 02 I have to end where so I need to get l also which is at index 2 so if I say three it will take eel let's say I want to print from l so l is starts with two and then I have to end at seven Right? But even if you say 9, there's no issue because you're starting with L. And when you say nine, it simply says, okay, go till the end. I don't care where it is. Even if you say 100, it will end at O. That also means you can skip the last part. I mean, if you just want to print at the end, why to even have a higher number? Just say empty. It will go to the end and your job is done. And not just for the end part, you can also define for the start part. Let's say I want to end at three. I want to start from zero but end at three. You can do this. So, Python is fun, right? Uh, let me clear this and let me print text again. What else we can do here? Let's say I want to print L US Ko, but I want to change that T E L to be capital and US KO to be small. Okay. So, first of all, I can assign directly a new value to it. Example, something like this and enter. This will work. If I say text, there is no problem. The new text itself is tel capital and us ko small. Now why it is working is because you are changing the value of a variable. And you can change the value of a variable. Nothing wrong with that. Right? But now what I wanted to do is okay let me just get back to the score. And now if you say text it now what I want to do is I just want to change the existing string. Let me repeat. I want to change the existing string and make the first three letters capital. If I want to do that, I maybe I can say text and then okay, first of all, I just want to get some extra space here. I will say text and then I can specify from 0 to three which is the first three characters uh because three is excluding I can say equal to T E L. Now if we can do this that means the first three letters will be changed to teal capital TEL us should remain same because we are trying we are trying to change the string itself and if you say enter it is giving you an error it says you can't do that string object which is steer object does not support item assignment basically you can't change the existing string okay that's cool um so this is one thing you have to remember you can't change the existing string you can change the value of a variable but you can't change the ex existing string. Now if you're thinking both are same right no I you this will make much more sense once we talk about references objects it will make sense okay apart from this I want to show you one more thing that and I'm sure um in fact two more things and then we we are going to end this uh let's say if you want to find the length of a string you can use the len function again we have not talked about functions at this point but just imagine there is something in the world which will take your text and or your data and find the length of it. That's what it's doing here. Uh maybe I also want to print something. Maybe I want to write a poem which is not in one line because see if you say text is equal to and if you say my name is Naven ready welcome to Talis. Okay, by default I'm saying T is E capital. So if I do this I'm writing this in one line, right? And maybe I want to print this in two lines. So one thing you can do is you can put a slashn here and then when you try to print text not like this but if you try to print text with a function it will print on two different lines. So we have to put this /ash n here for the new line. So this will get printed and then this will print a new line on which you are printing welcome. There's another way of doing this. I'll clear this. I will say text is equal to you can use triple double quotes. Okay, that's weird. But uh and then you can say enter and you can say my name is Naven. Welcome to Tisco. And when you do this, you have to make sure that you end with triple double quotes. And when you say enter, it worked. And if you try to print text, of course, it will print in this fashion. But if you print in a text or you using a print function, this is what it does. Okay. So you want to use this syntax or the syntax which I've used before, your choice. So yeah, that's about string in Python. See you in the next video. [Music]"

Now what happens when you work with text and this text in programming are normally called string. Okay. So let's go with this. So when you say a number so let's say if you want to represent a number let's say 45 and when you say enter that's a proper value. Now when you open a prompt a python prompt and when you type something it tries to convert that into some sensible thing. Example when you say 45 it knows that's a number. So it will take a number and say okay I got your number that's this is your number that's what you can see on the screen. But now if you type a statement again what is statement? We'll talk about that later. But in short in Python basically whatever code you write each line is one statement. Not always uh statement is one thing. So normally we write one statement in one line. It may happen that you write one statement in multiple lines. It will make much more sense once we talk about this in the upcoming videos. At this point when you write a number or a statement it will try to read that and convert that. Here 45 works. But what if if I say Naven now Naven is my name. And when you try to do that Python says what's wrong with you? Why you are saying Naven? See when it when you have a variable example let's say if I say num is equal to 8 now num is a variable right and the value for num is 8 and then when you try to print num it works so this num is a variable now python knows it is because you have assigned the value to num just before that particular statement when you're printing it what about this this is not a variable and my intention was to treat that as a string or the text it's not happening. It's because whenever you type something Python Python tries to convert it. So here num it knows naven it has no idea. So we have to say hey you know that naven is not a variable. It's a string. It's a basically a text which I want you to take and do whatever you want but take take that value. And if you want to do that you have to put that in a single quote. So basically you can write naven but you have to make sure that you put single quote at the start and the end to specify this is where it starts and this is where it ends and it's not just a word it can be multiple words example if I say naven ready theisco so it can be multiple words in one particular string and at this point I'm just want to focus on naven I will say enter and it works you can say it says naven as it is of course you can use print which we were using before and you can put that here again I'm not talking about print in detail yet we'll talk about that later but imagine print is printing something and at this point I'm printing nave and you have to make sure that you put that single code otherwise if you don't put it again your python will be unhappy by you by saying what you're doing why you're saying nav inside print I have no idea what you're talking about so when you say print you have to put single quote and then navin then it it knows okay that's a string I want to print it and now this time there's no single quote because when you simply say Naven with single quote it will print single quote as well because that's what it is representing that it's a string but when you print it says okay I want to print Naven so it is what it's doing when when you write multiple lines of code when you want to do that when you want to execute we'll always use print will not be putting this openly there uh it's just for ideally which we are using here or the prompt okay so this is working but what if you want to print so let's say I want to print something example I want to Print Naven laptop. Okay. So when you do that, when you say Naven laptop and or maybe Naven Tiscoco, it's time for self branding or self-promotion. Okay. So when you say enter, you can see we got Naveniscoco. As I mentioned, you can have multiple words. What if I want to be grammatically correct here? So something like this. I want to print Naven's Tisco. Will this work? Think about this before I enter this. If you have answer in your mind, that's good. Let me enter. and verify if it is matching with yours. Enter. Oh, it's not working. Why it's not working is actually very simple because if you see here, let's talk about this particular thing here. When you say single quote and single quote, this single quote first is a starting point. This is the ending point. Perfectly works. But here when you say this statement, this is the starting point. Where is the ending point? Logically for us it's here. This is the ending point. But then if you read this statement properly, this is where it starts and this is where it ends. Okay? And there's no starting point again and then we are ending. That's why Python Python is saying okay I'm happy with this. This looks like uh one particular string. What comes after? I have no idea. And then you are putting a extra quote here. So it says unterminated string lit. Okay. So this is where you start the string lit and it's not you're not ending it. Example if you end it here uh then it will give you a new type of error because it says you forgot the comma or something. There's no issue with this particular thing. Now it is creating issue with this. What is this s after this name? Okay let me just clear it out. And now let's try to solve it. This is what we're trying to solve right. What we want to achieve is of course if I remove this particular quote here it will work but I don't want to remove it. So in this case instead of using a single quote you can use a double quote. So string you can represent with the help of single quote or double quote both works. So if I say enter now there's no issue because it knows string is getting started with double quote. It will end with double quote. This single quote here is a part of the string. There's no issue. The problem starts when you want to print let's say telesco in double quotes. Okay, something like this. I will just delete this and I will show you what I want to print and then you help me. So I want to print something like this. I want to print Naven. Oh, what did I do? Okay. So this is what I want to do. I want to print Naven's then space and then taliso in double quotes. If you want to do that, of course you have to put that in a print. But then inside this print you have to put some code single quote or double quote. Now you think what will work? If you put single quote example something like this if you do that then this particular single quote will feel bad. I mean why I'm here but if you put double quotes then this telescope will feel bad. Why the why the double quotes are here? Okay. So we have to keep something happy. So what we can do is see this single quote here it has no special meaning because this has a meaning because this is where you are specifying starting and ending point this has no special meaning and we have to tell that to Python hey we don't want to treat this something special and if you want to cancel the special effect of the single quote you can put a slash so whenever you want to cancel something we will see that in the next uh section of this video if you want to cancel some special meaning you put a slash and now when you do that there's no problem because this particular single quote is treated as the starting of the string this is getting treated as the ending of the string and the special meaning of this quote is getting cancelled by that backslash so that's important next I will just clear this out I just want to have a fresh so let's say I want to print Naven here and of course it will work provided I put that in the single quote and I will do that do that enter but what if I want to print Naven 10 times times with a space of course. So I will just say naven space and then I will again say naven space and then I can keep doing that. Okay and this will work. If I say enter this works but then I don't want to print this multiple times. If I want to print 10 times I have to type 10 times. Instead of that you can simply use a math here. You can say I got a string and I want to do that 10 times. It will work. Okay that simple. So, Python is actually fun because you can do all these things with Python. Now, I want to try out one more thing. I will just clear this twin. And here I want why I'm saying Python. It should be print. I will say C/ users/naven. Now, when you do that, what do you think will be the answer? Of course, I'm putting that in single code. There's no special symbols here. And when I say enter, it should work. The moment I do that, it is giving you error. It says the uni code error uni codecape codec cannot decode bytes in position two and three which is 0 1 2 and three. This two. Now why it's saying uni code is because when you say slash u or slash n. So when you will have a character after slash it treats or the alphabet after slash it treats as a special character. Example slash n means new line. There are multiple characters, multiple uh uni codes here and it says you will have issues when you do that. Now what I want to do is I want to cancel out the meaning of slash again I will do slash because slash n itself is a special meaning. Okay so when you say double slash now it will work. So this is something you have to remember when you work with slash or special thing inside your string. Uh you have to cancel the special meaning you can put one more slash to cancel the meaning of the slash itself. I know that's tricky, but it's quite fun if you know how to work with it. So, yeah, that's about this video. See you in the next part of string."

",IN,https://yt3.ggpht.com/0nsZM3NF0C9bFr2IFXicMJ1w82ldRaZvGKFnezBe2lpW7F9gI92FaLubcTghnNNt4Ld8DfRvEMo=s800-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj,2680000,2100,true,"Now once we have the setup done for the python then we have done for the ids we are going to use of course we're not going to use all uh we'll start with one but before we jump into vs code or pycharm the idea is when you learn a language you want to start from the basics and that's what we are going to do now and when you install python so in fact before we go for python I want to show you one more thing when you open a command prompt on windows this is the command prompt which you can see on the screen and on this command prompt when you perform some operations so let's try de diir now when I say when I do that it will list all the files in the in this particular folder so in the naven folder I got all these files right so basically command command prompt understands the command example cls will clear it but when I perform 2 + 3 it will say 2 plus 3 is not recognized as internal or external commands that basically means your command prompt work with the commands. So pre-built commands. It can be internal or external. But on the other hand in Windows basically we got something called a PowerShell. Now in this PowerShell which looks like a command prompt but bit different. This is a tool built by Microsoft to have their own shell kind of thing which we have in Linux based OS or Mac. So we got shell there uh where we use bash. Here they have created something called bash. I mean sounds good but uh it's more like a bash but done for Windows and now it is they have open sourced it so we can use it in multiple places. Now, PowerShell supports scripting. Okay. So, when I say the same command diir, I think the command di works here. Command ls works here for the same thing because ls coming from the uh the shell background. Uh then I can also use clear for clearing, I can also use cls. So, it's a combination of command prompt with shell and it's fun. But since you can run a scripting language, so even python people call it scripting language and makes sense because you can write scripts there. Uh but then by default we got this shell and in shell if you say 2 + 3 you do get the output as five. Okay so this is how you run shell. Again we are not here to run shell programming but you can write uh shell commands here like eco eco and if I say naven it will print naven. So eco is a command in shell to print something. Uh but if you want to do that in python how will you do that? So let's say I want to get into Python and that's why you can type Python in the command prompt or in the PowerShell it works. When you say enter it will open a prompt. Now this is called the Python idle. In fact you can open that Python ideally in a separate window but you can do all the things here. So let's say if you don't want to do that here. So I can say and it will open a separate prompt where you can perform the operation. So we have an option of creating a file, you can edit the file, you can run the script and you can configure. So there are a lot of options here which you can work with if the font is small. Okay, it's zooming the height not the font. Okay, but we have to find some setting for the increasing of the font. This is the uh Python ideally which is the integrated development learning environment. So it makes sense to test something to learn. But then we are going to use prompt here. the Python prompt and this is also a ripple which is read evaluate print loop ripple where you can read the text you can write the text you can evaluate something you can print something so that's how it is okay so here what I'm going to do first of all I will say 2 + 3 the space is not mandatory I will just increase the size a bit so the space is not mandatory here but it looks good I will say enter and you got five okay that works what else we can do we can perform perform multiple mathematical operations here. So we we have done for the addition maybe if you want to do subtraction you can do that uh maybe you can if you want to multiply uh you can do that even you can have not just one operations but multiple so let's say 5 + 9 - 4 even that works oh okay I was you got the same 10 10 just a coincidence but it has to follow some grammar right example let's say if I say 8 + 9 - 4 it will work but what if I miss four there will it work if I say it will give you some bad words. It will say Python has some issues in the file which is creating the behind the scene. It says invalid syntax. So this is not a syntax which will work. Okay. So I will just clear it out. I want a empty screen. So yeah you it will follow the grammar. You have to follow it otherwise it will not work. Now let's say u I'm going to say 9 + 2 * 3. Now of course there should be some output for this and when I read this from start to end it will be 9 + 2 11 into 3 is 33. That's what I'm expecting. On the other hand, if you know the rules of board mass where multiplication will come first, then it will be doing the addition. In that scenario, it will be 2 into 3 which is 6. 6 + 9 is 15. So what do you think? Will it be 33 or 15? Let's try it out. When I say enter, we got 15 is because it is following the board mass. So it is multiplying first then it is adding it. But what if I want to add first then I I want to multiply. So as for the board mass, we have to put a brackets there. So I can put a bracket 9 + 2 and then I will say multiplied by 3 and when I say enter it will be 33. So yeah p mass is there. So what else we can do here? Let's say I want to find a cube of a number. So 8 into 8 into 8. That's how you find a cube. Of course square is 8 into 8. Cube is 8 into 8 into 8. If you want to find 8^ 4 it will be 8 into 8 into 8 into 8. I I'm not sure how many time I have said 8. Doesn't matter. But you got the point. When I say enter, we got 51 and2, right? But what if I want to find 8^ 12 or 8 power 10? That's a big number. So of course, I can damage my keyboard by typing all those things. Or we can use something called a power something like carrot sign. This should work. But it's not working. It's not working. It is doing something else. We'll talk about it what is doing later. Uh something to do with bitwise. But at this point, it's not working. So we have to use double star to do the power. So 8 power 10 and this is the number. I'm not sure if 8^ 10 is that number. We just have to accept whatever Python says or we can just find for three. If it says 512 then the previous one should be correct provided the value the output of this is not out of range. Okay. Uh so that's a tricky part. Anyway the point is this is how you do the power. Uh we have not tried the division. Let's try division now. So let's say I want to do 8 / by 2. Of course it should be four. But then we are not getting four. We are getting 4.0. Why is because when you say 9 divid by two you got 4.5. That means when you do divisions you do get the point values. Now these are called float numbers. So it says 9 divid by 2. Of course you are getting 4.5. That means when you do 8id by two you might get the decimal value or the point values here. So 4.0 zero makes sense. Uh but then when you try to understand the division of a number, what you get is you get two outputs, right? So if you see on the screen here, we got let's say if you're dividing uh 9 by two, you got two things. One is the quotient which is four and the remainder which is one. So how do I do that? What if I want quotient and remainder separately? In that case you can say nine. You just have to put double slash and when you set two now you will only get the quotient. But what if you want a remainder? In that case, you have to use something called a mod symbol and you said two and you got one. This will make much more sense when once we start with uh even or examples with the conditional statements. But you will see that later. At this point, just remember if you want a quotient from a division, you say four. You I mean you say double slash. If you want a remainder, you use a percentage symbol. We can also call it as a mod. So that's how you basically perform the operations in the Python prompt. Again, we are not using the VS code other stuff at this point. We'll do that later. But this is what it is. So let me talk about something about variables. Of course, we'll not go in detail. There should be a separate video dedicated for variables. So let's say I want to perform some operation. Maybe we can pick up from any one of it. Uh maybe I want to pick up this particular operation here. So in the prompt you can just keep the or you can press the arrow button up or then you you will get the previous commands. Now here when I do that of course I got five and two and then if I want to use this value in the next operation. So let's say I'm I'm performing 5 plus and I want to say 5 + 512. But then I'm not sure about the previous value. I'm saying 512 here but maybe I'm not sure about the previous value. In that case, if I want to pick the last value, how will I do it? In that case, you can use something called an underscore, which is kind of a box which stores the previous value. I can say variable, but we don't have a name for it. Now, what do you mean by variable? Imagine variable as a box in which you have a value if that makes sense. So, a box where you have a value and we are naming it something. So, here the underscore is a name for it because that's the only box you can see in front of you. So, it says five plus box. Okay? Okay. And box says 512. When you say enter, we got 517. But now if I say 2 + 512, I can't say underscore because when you say underscore, now it will pick up the last value which is 517. Okay, what I want is 512. Let me show you the proof. When I say enter, we got 519 because 2 plus the previous value which is 517. But I want 512. Now if you want to do that, we have a simple concept. Let me clear it out. What you do is you store this operation which is this in a variable a named variable. So let's say I will say num one equal to. Now what is this num one? Num one is the variable a box with a name as num one. Then in that box you are storing a value which is 8^ 3 that equal to is for the assignment. So this value is getting assigned to this num one. So of course it will first evaluate the value which is 512 goes into num one. Now when I say enter you can see it is executed but you're not getting anything because in the previous operation when you were doing whatever we are doing you are getting the print of it in the next line but here it's not doing it is because when you assign a value it says okay I'm done my job I am assigning that value to a variable. If you want to print it just mention that you want to print it. So you say num one. But then in actual programming of Python when you do that later you will be using something called print. Again we have not talked about what is print till this point but it works. We'll talk about this later what is print is this is the way you do that in the upcoming sessions not here. But here num one works. Okay. Now if I want to perform some operation let's say 4 + 8 and this is 12. But now I want to perform the operation which is 5 plus. Now this plus I want to add 512. So of course I can type 512 or I can't use underscore because underscore will be the last value which is 12 I can use num one that if that makes sense not just num one I can create num two as well with a new value let's say simply 8 and now I'm saying num one plus num two and you can see we got 520 and the beauty is you can create another variable you can store the addition of num 1 plus num two in this and now I can print num three So it's that awesome. So this is how you can store the values here. So yeah, that's about it. Now what if you want to work with text? Because at this point we are only working with numbers. We're not working with text. How will you do that? How will you perform operation on that? Uh let's see that in the next video. [Music]"

So basically we can use a simple notepad where you can type the code and then you can use a interpreter on your terminal to run the code. Here's the thing when you build software it's not just about writing code it's also about debugging it. So debugging basically means removing the bugs from the application. Uh maybe there's something which you want it to work and because of some issue you're getting weird output or it's not running. I should get some sleep. [Laughter] So you have to debug it. Next maybe you want to create documentation. Next maybe you want to create a package so that you can deploy it on the cloud. So all these things should be at one place and that's where I comes to the picture which stands for integrated development environment. Now especially for Python we got lot of different ids available. The most famous one is VS code. Okay when I say most famous is because VS code can be used to work with multiple languages like we got JavaScript, C, C, CSS, TypeScript, Python, Java and list goes on. I mean of course you can't see that here but uh it's it's great and it is built by Microsoft but now it is open source no I mentioned but yeah it is open source now when you go to VS code here this is their website so you can say it says your code editor redefined with AI so that that's why we with the latest trend in the AI you can use AI for development and it works that's important okay so that's VS code apart from this we got one more in fact there multiple but then this is also famous which is PyCharm. Now PyCharm is built by JetPlanes. Now if you have no idea what Jetrains is, this is a company who makes tools for the developers and they have amazing tools for different languages for different uh work. So if I go to Jedrains, this is their website and this is a tool but apart from PyCharm which is specifically for Python. If you click here developer tools, we have multiple options here. Now you can choose your language and I'm sure they might be having some tool for that. Okay. So this is uh PyCharm only ID you need for web development data a IML and supercharge with AI enhance. And I'm a big fan of JetBench tools. No this is not a paid stuff. I mean not a paid promotion but yeah there's one thing bad. Okay I can't say bad. It's just that if you want to use great things you have to pay for it. So this is PyCharm and if you they they give you two options. Now PyCharm is better than VS code if you go for the first option which is the paid one. So the PyCharm paid software which is they call pro is amazing. There's no competition between VS code and PyCharm paid version. But if you don't want to pay then you have to use the community version which is great but it lack features. Now if you go down uh in fact if you click on download here you can see there are two versions one is pycharm which is unified product I will come back to unified in some time and there's pycharm community version now if you don't want to pay for it you can go for the community version you can click on download free but now in the earlier days they used to have only pycharm I think or pro where you have to pay for it but now you get this unified product where you have a combination of a pro and community version. So for the first one month you will get it all the features but after 1 month they will stop some of the features and uh you will get to know once you use that. So don't worry we are going to use VS code most of the time and maybe you will try to explore PyCharm in between and maybe intentionally I will do that is because you should not be dependent on an IDE but you should know all the ideas. Okay, that's that's the problem and that's a good that's a fun actually not a problem that's a fun thing. Uh apart from this we have one more which is Jupiter. Now people especially in the a IML world they explore Jupiter like anything but yeah you can do that in PyCharm also but in the pro version if I'm not wrong. Uh but if you go down this is Jupiter which is very good and I will show you how why it is good. So when you install uh in fact you can install on your machine they call Jupyter notebook you can also try the lab which is which has multiple features but if you want to try it on the browser click here and out of this I want to try Jupyter notebook you can try it online okay we'll we'll see that in one of the video so we have three options and there should be multiple options but just three famous VS code PyCharm and Jupiter so let's start with VS Code Now how do you get VS code on your machine? It's very simple. Go to the website. There should be option of download for Windows and based on which OS you're working with. So I will click on download for Windows and it will download on this machine but I will cancel it is because I already have assist set up in this machine and it's straightforward. You just say next next and you will get the software. And if I want to show you so this is how VS code looks like. Okay this is the first page. I will just close this and increase the font size. This VS Code. Now, how do you work with this? It's very simple. You click on this. This is where you will see the project uh explorer where you can see project I mean the folder, the files and stuff. Uh this is where you can search for a particular file. This is where you can do work with source control like git. This is where you can run and debug and this is where you can add extensions. Now as VS code works with multiple languages sometime you have to add the extension in fact most of the time you have to add the extensions for a particular language or a particular feature so that you can work with it. Now why they don't give everything in one place maybe you know they should provide all the extensions by default see it will make it very heavy because there are a lot of languages lot of tools if they give everything your system will die and I don't want your system to die. In fact they don't want your system to die. So it makes sense to not have all the extensions pre-installed and we'll see which in extensions we need. So first of all I will just go back here and what you do is you open a folder. So maybe in your machine create a folder then open it from here. Go to desktop. So go with the folder which we are working with which is Python codes and or you can create new one. So we already have one file here. If you don't have that file it's okay. Just click on this button here which is new file and name it anything you want. Let's say demo one. And this is how it will open. I don't want any suggestions. Close it. In fact, enter it. Now, this is where you can type the code. So the what code I want to type. I will say print. And in the single code, just say theisco or I will say welcome to theiscoco. I'll just save it. So you got your file, you got your code. And now in the terminal. Now if you don't see a terminal here, it's fine. You can just click here. uh or if you see the option of terminal on the top is just because I have zoomed my ID they don't have a space so terminal new terminal you will see that window here and once you are here just say python and the file name which is demo 1 and click on enter you can see it says welcome to talisco or you can run it from here so you can just click this and it will run the only thing you have to do is if you don't see this option make sure that you have extension for file py. You might not say this by default. So that's how you do it. So what's the beauty about an IDE? Just type the code here. Just run the code here. You can debug here. Everything in one place. Now let's talk about the extensions. So when you go here for Python specifically, I already have those extensions. You can see install just this theme which you're seeing here. Then pilance, Python and debugger. You don't have to install all. Just install this one which is Python. So how do you do that in the search extensions? Just type Python and you will see Python here. There's a tick here because it's already installed or because it's from Microsoft. Yeah, you will see this. There should be an option of install. Just click that and yeah, you'll be having a extension of Python in your VS code. It might ask you to restart your IDE in case uh if it asks just restart the ID. Yeah. And that's how V code VS code works. Just remember this section on the left hand side. create as many files you want. If you want to get subfolders, you can do that. And there should be a run button here. You can change the layout if you want. So you can see we have all these options and it works. I think they also give you copilot by default or there to sign up for it. We'll see that later. Okay. So that's about um how to use VS Code here. And now it's time to work with PyCharm. So how do you get PyCharm? Go to their website, click on download. You can get the unified product or you can get the committee version and it says committee version is now part of the unified product. That makes sense. So download this one. Click on download. It will download on your machine. I already have that set up in the machine. Just say next next it will be done. Now once you have this and if you in fact I I also want to show you the pricing for this. So if you are a individual this is the pricing for you for the PyCharm Pro $99 for first year and uh for teachers students you get it for free. So if you have the student email teachers email you can do this. I'm a content creator so I got one. So that's the pricing. Now once you have that in your machine open PyCharm this is how it will look like. You will not see any projects because you you might be doing this for the first time. I've done this before and that's why I see all these options here. Now in this also you see the option of notebook like you have in Jupiter. You can do that from here as well. Uh but then we want to create a new project. So just click on new project here. And you can name anything you want. I'm just naming it as Python project 2 because I'm not going to use the same project again. Uh and then you mention the version of Python we are working with it which is 3.13. And click on create. Now once you do that you will see the project here. We have external libraries by default because it has its own way of creating a project here. Now how do you create a file in this Pycharm. Now first of all in the left hand side we got project section. We got uh Python console here. If you want to execute certain things you can get the terminal you can get the version control. On the right hand side you see notifications. You got chat juni. Yeah looks good. Now in this project you will right click and say new Python file and you name it and by default you will get the extension aspy. Okay by default because this is PyCharm that's the only language it supports. Right now here I just want to increase the font and this is why I love JetBl ID. You can just go to appearance and click on whatever number I think 175 is good number. It should be visible. Now here I will just say print. I will just say hello and save. And you will see an option of running here. Click on this and it runs. You can see we got hello. So we got a console and we got the place where you can type. We got project section. So this looks cooler than VS code but VS Code is lighter than PyCharm. So it doesn't matter which one you use. Both are amazing. Personal preference. We'll be using VS Code because a lot of people are familiar with this. If you love PyCharm, use it. No issue. Code will remain same. And now it's time for Jupiter. Of course, we're not going to install this locally. We'll try to run it online. You can just try if you want to install on this your machine. Click on this. You will get the setup. But we'll try it on the browser, the notebook. Try it on your browser. And go down. Click on Jupyter notebook. And this is what you will see. Of course, lot of things are pre-built. What I will do is I will just click on file, new notebook. It will ask you for the kernel. I want to select Python. Select here. Okay. Now this is how it looks like. I will zoom it a bit. Now if you want to print this is where you type it. I will say print in single quote. Hello. And just click on run. You will see the output here. Now this makes sense when you want to write smaller code or if you want to see the graphs you know it's fun when you work with pandas here where you see all the graphs and stuff. So this good. Okay. So based on what you like, some people prefer Jupyter, some people prefer VS Code or PyCharm. So based on your liking, you can try it out and it works. If you want to get multiple files, you can just click here, file, create new, new notebook. And it supports a lot of shortcuts to work with it. You can also write documentation. Example, this particular cell has a code. This cell you can have a markdown. You can write some notes here. So this is a good place actually to learn. But if you want to work on a big project, PyCharm or VS Code, choice is yours. In the next video, we'll focus only on the VS code and we'll write some code. In fact, not in the video, but in the upcoming videos. [Music]"

So how do you get the setup? See it's very simple when you write a code of course you want to execute somewhere and where you going to write the code? You can use notepad or you can use any editor for that matter. Example, if I open my notepad and if I type a command or let's say if I want to print something and I'm going I'm going to explain what this print and stuff later. But let's say if I say print hello, I want to execute this and when I'm going to do this and that's where you need the Python interpreter. So to do that go to the official website of Python and intentionally I'm saying official is because there are a lot of place where you can get the Python setup but there they might be malicious. So better to go on the official website and go to downloads and based on which OS you're working with. So if you're working with Windows, select that. If you're working with Mac and other other platforms, I'm using Windows here. I will click on Windows. And in this you have multiple versions version of Python as well as the version of Windows we are working with. Example, if you if your Windows version is 64-bit like i5, i7, Ryzen, so you can go with the Windows installer 64. If you are using the ARMbased chip, you can check that with your laptop and desktop. If it says ARM processor, go with this one. Now, since in this machine I got Intel chip back to the 64-bit, I will go with this version. Even the Windows is 64-bit. I will click on this. And before I do that, make sure that you download the stable version. The problem is if you download the pre-release version which might have few extra features but then all these beta versions are not fully tested properly and if something goes wrong you have no idea what's going wrong is it you or your Python setup uh see of course once you understand the language better once you have built certain projects you can try out the previous version but now at this point I would I won't suggest you to go with this go for stable version click on this and it will download. Now I do have the setup already downloaded. Now before you do this, in fact I wanted I wanted you to check one more thing which is do you already have Python in your machine? If you have then that step was not required but I don't think anyone will have by default if you have not worked before on Python. Okay. So now open your terminal and how do you check if you have Python or not? just type python and version and if you see something like this by saying python was not found that means you don't have it also sometime you know when when you install python 3 that's the latest version of python sometime you get python 3 as well so check with this command as well python 3 and make sure you don't have any of that if you don't have any of that then you can install python so download it and then click on this simple installation it will open this prompt Now on the first screen make sure that you takeick this add python.exe to path so that you don't have to manually do all the process of setting the path. The why someone will do this is because when you save the files of python you store it in some other folder. The python setup will be some other folder. So there you have to link the path. Then if you don't want to do that just take this and click on install. Now simple setup you have you might have to say next at some point and it will be done. So it's happening happening happening taking some time. Okay so Python installed successfully that's what I'm getting. Okay so how to verify this? Go to your terminal and say Python version and when you say enter it will not work. But you will say hey you got Python there it's not working anymore. See the thing is uh when you install softares and when you try to run run the command you have to make sure that you reopen your terminal and why I'm saying that is because people do miss it and then they feel bad hey we have done all the setup still not working it's because you forgot to reopen your terminal now once you reopen it just try it now and it will work cool right but in case if Python is not working try Python three. If that works, you still should be happy. But if that work, if Python 3 works and then you want to say, hey, you know, I want I'm happy with this command. I don't want Python 3. Then you can change it. There's allies you can use. Ask the AI models and it will give you the answer. How do you do the allies? Anyway, so for me the Python command is working. So I will just work with that. Now once you have Python installed, what you can do is you can open the Python prompt. See if you have python install and in the terminal itself if you say hey you know I got print I want to execute a python function or python statement if I say enter you can't run your python code directly here you basically need a prompt python prompt and the way you can get that is go to your terminal and just say python and say enter when you do this you will get a popup here or you will get something which says uh Python with with the version and these three arrows here. That means now you can execute your Python code here. Now which code I want to execute? I will stick to my print. So I will say hello. Enter. And you got hello there. Congratulations. This is your first step to run Python code on your machine. So that's how you print hello here. Okay. But then what if you have multiple lines of code, not just one, maybe 10 lines of code, maybe 100, maybe thousand. Not a good idea to have all the lines of code in one file. But let's say imaginary stuff. How will you do that? Of course, you can type all the statements here. But then if you do that, how will you debug? How will you modify? Lot of problems, right? In that case, you need a place where you will type the code. Not here. I don't want to type in prompt. I will just say exit. come out. Now once you're out, go to your notepad and type the code here as I did here. So you can see which says print hello. But then how will you execute this file? It's very simple. Just save this. Now when I'm going to save this, I will just store that in a C drive. So in the C drive create the folder as Python codes or wherever you want to store it. And in fact I will just use another thing. Say also Python plaques because Python code I'm using for some other thing. So we got Python pla here and give a name to your file. So I'm giving demo here. Any file name will do. Click on save and done. You got your file with your Python code. How do you run it? It should be simple. So type Python first of all the command Python and then mention the file name which is demo.txt. Oh, unfortunately I don't have this file in this naven folder. It's in the C drive. So we just go back go back and now in this I have a folder called python blacks that is a folder name clear and once you are in this folder you can check in this folder I have this file which is demo.txt and now I can run that command so python and I can mention the demo.txt txt file name. Enter. And it says hello. Awesome. Okay, this is working. But now the problem is, okay, what's the problem? See, the file name is .txt. Nothing wrong with txt in a major sense. But whenever you create a Python file, make sure that the extension of your file is py. Again, there's no compulsion. It will still work. But there are certain features which we are going to learn later like importing where you need to have Python extension. Next when you work with the IDE I will talk about ids later. Imagine a fancy editor in which you can basically if you want to use that IDE features which they provide you need to have dot extension which is py extension and it is good for readability as well. So when you see some file by py you know that's a python file. So I will just change this file extension here. Save as. And instead of txt I will say py. Now when I do that you can see the file is changed. It is demo. py. I can also check there are two files here. Now one is txt one is py. And now I will just try to run the command. So demo. py. Enter. It says hello. So finally we are able to run the python code on the machine. I know a simple code but and we are not even talked about what is this plaint stuff. We'll talk about that later. At this point the Python setup is working. Catch you in the next video. Bye-bye. [Music]"

See the thing is if you want to run Python you need a place where you can write your code. Of course you can use a simple notepad but then when you write that code your machine need to understand it and that's how the programming world works. So what happens is when you talk about the IT industry it's all about data right and to work with that data we need software which will store the data which will fetch the data which will process the data and to do that we have to write some code now of course we can do that with multiple languages but when it comes to Python we need a place to write the code and also we have to convert that code into machine code and that's where we have this concept of compilers interpreters So we are going to use those and of course we have to do that in the machine. So we have to install the softares but before we do that what if you want to try out the code before installing the software and that's why we can use some online compilers and this is very famous the online JDP compiler and if you go there it's not just for Python we can do that in multiple languages. Example, if I go here, if I select C, this is the C code. We have to basically write multiple lines of code just to print hello world. And don't worry if you don't understand the code, we are not even learning C here. But uh in Python also when I show you the code, I will explain later. So Java, this is the Java code to print hello world. And that's why maybe people are scared to learn Java because of all these words. And uh if you jump to in fact I want to explore VB has been a long time I worked on VB. Uh so this is the VB code the good old days. And coming back to Python now if you can see it says Python 3. So yeah there are multiple versions of Python. Python 2 was there for some time and then now it's end of life. Python 3 we got different versions and this should be the latest one which they're using. I'm not sure but anyway you this is Python 3 and what you see on top here is the comment and this thing here is your code. Now what we are trying to do here is we are trying to print hello world. Okay. And whatever code you want to write here you can write and you can execute. Now this will convert that code into binary. It will run on their servers because we are running online and you will get the output. Okay. And what this print is doing it's a function. We are going to discuss what are functions, what are those brackets later. I know I love surprises. So here I'm just going to click on run. There are multiple options and put displacement. Okay, let's try this. Okay, trying the displacing for the first time. I think it will give a new window. Let me run it here itself. And you can see we got hello world. Now don't get upset because of this black screen. I have seen people getting upset because of we're getting output on a black screen. So that's fine. We're learning a language here and of course in future you're going to build application for web you might be doing for the web the J application and most of the time when you build a back end in Python the front end will be done with the help of HTML says JavaScript so don't worry about the black screen here output doesn't matter I mean output matters where it is printing doesn't matter okay so that's how you can write your first code but then I'm not happy because we're doing online of course I'm not saying that it's not a good place but I need more control and that you get on the local machine. Now for that we have to install some softares. Okay. So when you go to Python website there's option of downloads and we have to install some softwares. So what is that? Let's see that in the next video. [Music]"

In this tutorial, we will understand about one of the emerging and popular build tool for Java and Spring Boot developers which is Gradle. Before we install Gradel and work with it, first we need to understand what is a need of Gradle, right? Or what is a need of build tool in general. If you're already aware of Maven or AND, you can skip the initial part and go ahead in this tutorial by installing Gradel. Now to start with whenever we develop an application it is not just the code which we write sometimes we may have to use the libraries a code which is written by someone else right and then by including the libraries which is coded by someone else maybe a framework or third party library you're using in your project you'll be writing the code not just that once you write the code you may have to compile the code and for whatever code you have written you may have to write the test cases you may have to execute all the test cases and finally your entire our code plus library files together you may have to package into jarr var file once we package the executable file will be generated and that file we will use for the deployment of your application so basically there are many things involved whenever we write the code right if you don't use build tools then it is very hard for us to manage the dependencies manage the libraries of your application every time you may have to compile then structuring the test cases you know test cases which we are writing for our project executing all the test cases then packaging the entire application into jar rvar it is not an easy task there are many complexities associated with this that's where build tools comes into picture as a rescue if you use the build tools it'll help you to manage all the dependencies libraries of your application which you're using and it will help you to compile your code it will help you to run all the test cases in fact it will give you a specific structure wherein easily you can maintain your code. You can maintain all the test cases, you can execute them and finally it will help you to package your entire application into jarr file. A file which is executable directly you can use for the deployment. Right? Let me just quickly add few key points here. You can see here build tool is a software that automates the process of building your application. Building your application refers to compiling the source code, managing all the dependencies of your application, executing all the unit test cases which you have written. Then finally packaging your application into executable file Java or Java archives or maybe web archives depends on the type of the application and then it will give you the file which you can use for the deployment or for the further execution. Fine. Now there are many build tools available in the market. First we had the ant which is not being used right now. Then we have very popular and the mostly used build tool for the Java and the spring boot which is Maven and also one of the emerging and it is also getting popularity in the industry which is the gradal and that's what we are learning here. These build tools help us to manage the project better and in a easier way. It is like your assistant. If you use build tools then you need not to worry about the dependencies, libraries, jar files of your application. And you did not worry about the structure of the project because all of them will give you a specific structure wherein your code your test cases easily you can maintain all of the dependencies of your application. Also it will help you to package your application into jarr v file that's where we use the build tools. Now coming to the gradal it is faster and more easier than the maven. How exactly grad is we will practically see in this particular tutorial. If you already know maven or ant build tool then also you can understand everything about the gradal. Even if you are very new you'll be in a position to understand here how it is going to help us. Right now let's install grad into our machine for which you can open any of your favorite browser and search for gradal download. It'll give you so many options. The very first option from the gradal organization. You can click on this. If you are on the Mac, you can run some of the commands on your machine terminal or if you are using the Windows. You have an option here installing manually binary only. You can just click on this. It will start to download. Okay. As you can see here, it is downloaded successfully as a zip file. You just have to extract and you may have to execute it. Right? And before you even run this, you have to make sure that Java is installed on your machine. I'll make an assumption that you do have a Java. Okay? Let me just open my command prompt. And if you want to check whether Java is installed or not, you just have to run one command here. Right? Let's execute this command. Java- version, right? And uh I do have Java 21. So it is fine for me. It will work fine. So before you install Gradel and work with the Gradle, make sure that Java is installed on your machines, right? Let me just close this here. And of course, it'll be there on your downloads. Let me open this. As you can see, we have a Gradle zip file. I'll say right click here. Okay. And I'll just extract this. nothing more. And after I extract, I'll have an option of extracting this. I'll click on extract. It will be extracted on the same path. If you want, you can keep it separately also. Uh not a problem. You can see it has been extracted. If you open this, we haven't double click. We have to open this and then open bin and entire path you may have to copy and you may have to add into environmental variables. Let me open the environmental variables here. System environmental variables. And I would like to just go to environmental variables. And we have system variables here. Uh let me just go here and go to my path. Okay, we do have path option here. I would like to click on edit. Add this new path till bin. Entire path where exactly it is available I have copied and I have added here. Right. Okay. Now again I'll say okay. Now let me open the command prompt and check if it is installed. Let me open my command prompt here. Okay. I have opened my command prompt again. And this time I would like to just run this command grad. And the moment I run this, it is there gradal 9. That means it is successfully working fine. Now let's create one simple Java project with the gradal before we understand more on this. Right. Now let me open my drive here and uh I'll go to my D drive wherein I have created a separate dedicated folder grad projects and in this part I would like to create my project. So I'll open my command prompt here itself and by opening the command prompt or any of the terminal of your own choice I would like to just run one command here. gradal in it right first we will see grad project with the help of commands locally okay on the terminal later we will see the gradal project structure on the ide as well fine now to start with directly I'm just running some of the commands without using any of the ID just to understand the core of it fine now grad in it you have an option here select the type of the build to generate whether you want to build a library or any plug-in or you want to build an application I would like to go with the application so of course I would like to click on number one option Right. And then you have an option select implementation language. That's where difference comes with respect to Maven. Maven is used only for Java based projects. Gradal we can go with the Java, Kotlin, Groovy, Scala, C++ and Swift. It is more than Java. Right? Build tools are there to make your life easier. Right? Now for Java, the most popular one is Maven. And Maven build tool is there only for Java and Spring Boot only for the Java based projects. Right? Coming to the gradal, it is there for the Java, Kotlin, Groovy, Scala, C++ and Swift as well. I would like to go with the Java here. Number one, I'll click here and enter the target Java version minimum uh 7 and default is uh 21. I would like to go with the default. If you don't choose anything, it will choose default only. If you want, you can specify also. Not a problem. Project name. What is the project name you would like to give? I'll say here Gradle sample app. Okay, sample application. That's fine. And select the application structure. Single application project or application and library project. For now, I would like to just go with the single application number one. Even if you don't choose, by default, it is single application only. Select the build script. Either it is Scotlin or Groovy. In Maven also we do have a build script in the form of XML. POM.XML file in the Maven project structure. POM.XML is a file wherein we talk to Maven what we need. Similar to that if you want to talk to the gradal to get your things done then we may have to go with the build script and it is giving you option to choose Kotlin or Groovy which language you want to use in order to communicate with Maven maybe you want to add JUnit 5 library in your project maybe you want to add the spring you want to add Kafka you want to add Radius right all these dependencies jar files libraries if you want to add in the Maven project structure we specify that in the pom.xml XML file in the gradal we have build scripts which is in the form of Kotlin or Groovy in the Mav is heavy complex XML based syntax it is here it is Kotlin or Groovy any of your own choice I would like to go with the Groovy now I'll pick number two here we do have an option to go with number two okay and then it is asking to choose the testing framework for the unit test cases I would like to go with the JUnit 5 JUnit 5 refers to JUnit Jupiter so option number four here and then we have an option here it is asking Generate build using new APIs and behavior. Some features may change in the next minor release. You want to go no. I would like to keep it default. So I'll just say here no. Right now it is generating. The build is successful. The project is successful here. Right. Now let me open this. We can see here we do have the entire project structure. What exactly these are? We will understand about the wrappers and other things. We do have a gradal here. Okay. Gradle wrappers which are very very important which will give you runtime environment to make your Gradle application run on any other machine without them having to install the Gradle. Okay. And now we have an application here build.gradal which is used to specify what you need and we do have the source wherein basic Java code will be there here. Okay. Example it is asking me the basic Java code. Let me open here. If I open you can see hello world a basic Java you know project we have. And if you want to write any of the test cases, you can write here in the test by default one test case class also it will give you which you can check here. We do have this as well here. Okay, a basic code. Now how do we run that? We will try to see here. Okay, we have to just go here and execute one command. Let me just execute one command here. Okay, which is u grad tasks. Okay, now it'll give you all the task which grad can do you. The moment you execute this all the things which you can do with the gradal it will only give you the commands and what it does. You can see here the moment I have executed this gradal task all the task runnable from the root project. This is the project which we have created right runs this project as a JVM appure Java application then we have build task assemble you want to build package into jar r var file right if you want to execute all the test cases everything we do have here now I want to execute this to start with before we understand something more I'll say here gradal run the moment you do this the program will be executed and whatever application we have here that will be successfully executed we can see here we have hello world that was the basic application. If you want to add some other part there, some other code, of course, you can do that without any problem. Right? So this is the basic structure of uh Gradle. Let's understand more on Gradle going forward. Now, one more thing about the Gradle which you have to understand is that suppose if it is a Maven project, you have built a project using the Maven. Whenever you want to run that project, Maven must be installed. Even if you are running that project maybe you're building using any of the CI/CD tool genkins or maybe GitHub actions or anything there also Maven has to be configured in order to execute in order to build your project right not just that if I have built a Maven project on my machine and if you want to execute or run that Maven project in any other machine there also Maven has to be there that is not the case with respect to Gradle. If you have built a Gradle project in one machine, you can execute that Gradle project or run the Gradle project, run the build in any other machine without having to install Gradle. Even in the CI/CD build tools such as Genkins or GitHub action, if you want to build a Java project there, if you are using a Gradlebased Java project, then you need not to install that, you need not to configure that. And it is possible because of the Gradle wrapper. It consists of certain scripts and the runtime which is required all these small jar files which is required in order to run your application without having to install the gradal manually or locally on your machine. So whenever we develop a project a gradal project we will have so many things alongside that we will also have some wrapper file. We can see here gradal w grad w and if I have to show you the structure of the project let me open this and uh you can see here this will be the general project structure of a gradal application. Okay, we have a build.gradal about which you will understand. It is a place where we communicate with grad what we want. If you want to manage certain libraries, if you want some jar files or library files to get added, if you want to manage plugins of your application, maybe you have to specify which unit testing framework you want to use. Everything or which Java version you want to use. All these things we can configure within the build.gradal. How to write the build? We will understand. If it was a Maven project, it would have been a pom.xml file. Using the XML, we used to configure the things. Now whatever is required for your application the compiler version the plugins all the dependencies libraries which you want or frameworks which you are using all of that if you want to be managed if you want to add that into your project then you have to specify in the build.gradal Grad like the way we used to do in the pom.xml in the maven projects. Okay. And then we have here gradw which is a gradal script for the Linux and Mac and we have a gradalw.bat for the windows. We have to just use this in order to run your project. They need not to do something here. What what do you mean by that? If you ask me generally if you want to create the project or if you want to run this project what is the command we have used? We have used gradal run. If you say gradal run if gradal is installed on your machine only then the project will be executed. Right now even if you want to build a project now if you say here gradw.bat run now since you're using gradw here which is a gradal wrapper and because of which you need not to have gradal installed on your machine. If someone is taking this project and they want to execute if they're using gradw.bat it's a wrapper in order to execute your program they need not to have grad installed on their machine. That's the beauty of Gradle. That's one more advantage over the uh Maven project. Here you can see here this project will be executed and whatever output we have got here here also you'll get the same output. You can just wait and see here. As you can see it is executed right inside the wrapper we will have certain jar file certain scripts because of which it is able to execute your gradal project even if you don't have gradal installed. So make your gradal application run globally then we can go with this wrapper grad wrapper which is very very important. Right. Normally if you have installed Gradle then you can use a Gradle command and execute even otherwise with the help of Gradle wrapper. It'll make sure that your project is running on any machine globally without them having to install Gradle build tool. If it is not the case with respect to the Maven. If you want to run the Maven project, Maven has to be installed. That is not the case with the Gradle. Why it is not the case with the Gradle? Because of the Gradle wrappers which we have depends on the operating system. You can decide here. We can see here one is for the Windows and you know one is for the Mac and Linux only this it is if you are running this from the Mac or Linux grad.bat bad for the Windows machine, right? All the wrappers, jars, scripts are present which will make that possible. Apart from that, uh normally we have source main Java wherein your Java code will be there. Resources, all the supporting resources for your Java application that will be available, the configurations, the properties of your application and then we will have a dedicated test folder inside which you can write your unit test cases and you can execute and you can specify all the resources required in order to run your unit test cases. Fine. Now how do we have to configure this uh build that we will understand. Just to summarize this grad wrapper, it is a set of scripts and small jar files that allow you to run grad without installing grad manually on your system. If there is a gradal project even if it is not installed still if you can run because of the gradal wrapper classes. Now how do we configure this build.gradal equivalent to pom.xml in the maven project in order to talk to grad and get your things done. We will see that. Now one more important thing which you have to understand here is main gradal build script that tells Gradle what to do how you want to build your Java project or any project in that matter. What is the plugins you want to use with Java or any version you have to specify about the packaging whether it has to package as the JAR or var file or whatever libraries you want to use into your project. All these details we specify in the gradal build script which plays very very crucial uh you know role like the way we have pom.xml in the maven project structure we have build.gradal Gradle it could be in the cotlin it could be in the groovy in this project structure which I have created I have gone with the groovy style right and it'll look something like this we have to specify the plugins the versions of the spring framework you want to use you can see here we have added one dependency here the way we write the syntax that is using the groovy here we are not using xml so you if you already know the maven the syntax the way we used to specify in maven is different here because it is groovy here dependencies implementation which framework you want to use And uh what is a version of the spring framework that in the plugins you can add here. Java plug-in we have added here. The spring framework plug-in we have added here. And then the coordinates we have specified com.ample or you can say if this project is being built in telesco we can specify com. Tellesco and what is the version of your project basically the coordinates of your project and then we can specify the version of Java we want to use. And the repositories part where we have specified Maven central. It's like whatever libraries you want to use in your project from where to get that libraries. Okay, we have specified get that from the Maven repository and all the dependencies the jar files or you can say frameworks which you want to use in your project. So dependencies in within the dependency you may have to specify it is like from the Maven central repository please do get if you have your own private repository you can specify that also here from where exactly you can specify the entire path local repository part or maybe any uh private repository path that also you can specify right now all the dependencies which I want to use in my project it is there in the maven central itself. So please get that from there. Okay. And within the dependencies, we have to specify this. You need not remember the syntax of what we have to add here. Even if you go to the Maven central repository like the way we used to go for the Maven project as well. We just have to search your example. I want to go with the spring core. And the moment you search for the spring code, it will redirect to this page and if I have to click this any of the version of the spring maybe I want to use this and by default you can see we have Maven, we have gradal all the options we have here and I want to go with the gradal. See you'll get an option here. You just have to copy this and uh add into your you know uh project build.gradal. Okay, that's how it has to be added. And the unit testing framework which I want to use is JUnit platform. That's the framework I want to use. All the things we have to specify inside this main build.gradal Gradle file that tells Gradle how you want to build your project about the plugins coordinate version name of the project version of the project and all the dependencies and libraries which you're using in your project and also how you want to package this entire application as a jar var everything how basically it has to compile it has to build your project we have to specify within the buildgradal if you know maven then it is like the way we have their pom.xml XML we have here build.gradal. It could be written in the Groovy also. It could be written in the Kotlin also. Now let's use an IDE and develop on Spring Boot or Java application and see the actual project structure how it looks like in the ID and we will have one demo for better understanding. Now let's see the demonstration of Spring Boot application with Gradal build tool for which I have open a spring tool suit IDE. You can open any IDE of your own choice whether it is intelligent idea, Eclipse or Spring tool suit. In fact, you can also create the project using Spring IO initializer. If you are aware of Spring Boot, you must be knowing different ways to create a spring boot application. Right? That should not be major matter of concern. Now I have open the spring tool suit. The beauty is from here itself directly you can create a spring boot application. Even otherwise you can create uh from the spring IO initializer and you can open the project in any of the ID of your own choice. Right now I would like to just go back to the file and we do have an option of uh creating a new spring starter project. Right. And uh it will be taking the project importing the project from the start.spring.io itself right but we have a shortcut here. Now it is asking me to give the name of the project. I would like to say here uh spring boot okay grad application gradal app that's the name I have given here gradal app and uh the type what is the build tool you want to use we have multiple options here one we can go with the maven or you can go with the gradal groovy or grad cotling I would like to go with the gradal groovy you can go with the maven or grad any one build tool you have to use whenever you are developing a springoot application this time we are going with the gradal groovy and the other aspects how the packaging has to happen. Java 17 I want to use and the group ID I would like to give uh com.tlesco telesco anything is fine right and then I would like to just click on next we do have an option of adding some of the dependencies if you want you can add the dependencies I would like to go here and add a spring web dependency okay I want to add this spring web dependency that's the only one just to create one basic rest api application okay now I would like to just click on finish it'll take some time and the project will be ready as you can see on your screen the project is ready here if I have to elaborate this we have multiple options Here you can see source/ main/java where we can write the Java code all the resources which are required for your application for your code we can write here within the application properties the same file the same structure what we have in the Maven as well right and then all the dependencies which we usually used to add in the pom.xml we have here a build.gradal file which is in the form of groovy you can see here it is similar to pom.xml XML it is you know all the plugins the coordinates Maven coordinates like we have here these are the gradual coordinates we have group version description okay repositories all the dependencies how much of dependencies you want you can add either at the time of project creation of the spring boot even other words from the Maven central repository also which we have seen earlier in this series you can add it and all the test cases what are the task you want to do I mean similar to what we have in the pom.xml XML we do have same here build.gradal here. Okay. We have Gradle wrappers also that is one of the advantage over Maven to the Gradle. Okay. Now I'd like to go back here. We do have a basic application here. Spring Boot application whether it is a Maven or whether it is you know uh Gradle doesn't matter the structure of the project and also the code will remain same. I would like to just go here and create one more package here. Okay. I'll say dot rest API or maybe dot web component and within this I would like to just create one basic uh class. Okay, let me just go here and create anything is fine. I'll say here telescope controller any name of your own choice. All right. And um if you know spring you should be knowing about these things. I'll add one stereotype annotation here. I would like to just go back and add this is my rest controller. Okay. I would like to import that and let me have one resource here. Okay, one simple resource. I'll say string. I'll say here get some information. Okay, I would like to just go back here and maybe return anything of your own choice. I would like to say here return maybe I would like to just demonstrate here um visit courses.tlescope.com. Okay, anything is fine. You can give any other uh u message also of your own choice. So I'll just say here visit courses.tlescope telescope.com or maybe I will just say here um uh grad telesco application okay and I have to bind this request mapping or you can just go with the get mapping okay I would like to just go with the get mapping bind this to HTTP get request okay these things are basic irrespective of learning whatever tool right and I would like to just add this okay that's fine now we have created uh one resource here. Now if you want you can execute the way uh spring boot application by default will have a tomat. You need not to have anything. The moment you run this application your application will be deployed on the tomcat without you have to do anything there. If you want you can specify the server information or any other information. Okay. Now uh if you want something extra to be added then build.gradal we have you can just add this here. Okay. And extra dependencies if you want or anything extra. Now the version I don't want it to be snapshot. I would like to just go back and say here maybe this is 1.0. Okay. And I would like to just uh save this. And now if you want you can in the ids also we do have an option to you know create a build generate a jar file and then run that jar file. We do have an option with the ids also. If not if you have already installed the maven then you can open the folder where we have this application. I would like to go back uh spring boot. Here is where this application is there. And from this location I would like to open command prompt. Okay, let me open the command prompt from from this particular location. Uh within no time it will be open. And from here also if you want you can just go through. Okay, in the project structure we do not have build yet. Build is not yet created here. That means jar file is not generated. The project is created. We have added the code. If you want the build to be generated I would just run one command here. Gradle build. It will compile the Java code. It will execute all the test cases and it will package your application like the way we have in the Maven Maven package. It'll compile the Java code, execute all the test cases and uh finally package your application into jar file. Similar to Maven package, we have Gradle build here. I would like to execute this command here and the moment I execute it is uh starting the demon which will uh be used behind the scene by Gradle in order to do all this task here. As you can see, we have got build success. It is able to compile first of all gather all the required resources compile and execute all the test cases and package your application into the jar file. If you want you can open this. If I have to open this folder now we have one extra folder. You'll be getting it. If I have to just uh refresh this. See here we have build. Earlier we didn't had this. And if I have to open this we have lips and you can see we do have spring boot grad app 1.0. It is executable jar file. This jar file now you can execute. It is able to generate one jar file. Maven package what it does? It'll compile all the Java code. Then it will execute all the test cases then package your application into jar rv file. Similar to that we have you know grad build here. Finally we could able to get the jar file. Now if you want you can execute this jar file also for which I would like to just say here okay uh java- jar. This is the command and then we have to specify where is that jar file. It is there inside the build. Inside the build we do have this. If I have to open this uh you know directory folder we have this build then lips and inside this this is the name. If this is a lengthier name we can reduce also uh it'll be easy for us in order to you know execute this. Before even we execute I'll do one thing. Let me just um if you want you can clear this also. I would like to say clean. Okay. How we have maven clean? We have grad clean as well. Okay. And now I would like to just get back to my application. And at the end I would like just to add one more thing here. Okay, I would like to just add here of jar. Okay, and uh within this I would like to just specify what I want. Right. So let me just specify here. I would like to say archives base name. Okay. And let just specify that equals to maybe anything. Okay. I'll say here Taliso app. All right. Or we can just give here as a single quote. Let me just rectify this. And then if I have to get back here we have specified I have saved this again I'll get back to my command prompt and one more time I would like to say here gradal build okay and if I execute this gradal build it will execute this build will be created if I have to open this folder it'll compile see it is compiling it is executing all the test cases then package your application into jar file okay the jar file which we have given the name now if I have to open this uh directory where we have the spring boot application I would just Go back here and uh refresh this. We have build created and we have libraries and you can see the name is Tellesco 1.0. The same thing I would like to use in order to execute. Now, now I would like to just close this and now again I will say here java- jar and then I have to specify the location where we have this jar file. Okay, it is there within the build. Within this build we have lips within this lips telesco - 1.0. So let me specify the same here. We can see I have included I just have to execute this. Okay. Internally you need not to set up any servers because spring boot by default uses Tomcat. So automatically your application will be deployed on the uh Tomcat. Okay. You can see it is starting and uh it is started on 80080 and the context path I have not specified. So let me just open this uh browser here and it is 8080. Okay. Local host col 80080. If I just refresh here grad telescope app whatever message we have given we could able to get now we could able to execute a spring boot application. It is just a demonstration of what we have seen. Now it's up to you whether you want to go with the widely used maven for"

Now Python is a highle generalpurpose language. It's basically a multiaram language which supports object- oriented functional programming, structured programming and procedure oriented programming. Okay, don't close the window. Okay, so we'll go step by step. Now what do you mean by a highle language? See, it's coming from year 1991. That's where Python was first released. And that's right. It's way back before Java or other model languages came into picture. But yes, it is getting famous now. But it's a old language. Now in that era we had a lot of languages. Right? Now most of the languages were working on directly on the machine. So maybe it is very close to the hardware. But Python on the other hand basically it's a highle language. Now why do we need a highle language? Now first of all if we talk about your machine it only understands one language which is binary language ones and zeros. That means if you want your machine to work as you want you have to basically talk to it using ones and zeros. I know you're not comfortable with that and that's where we have to write in different languages. Maybe there was a time we used to use assembly language where you have to pass commands to do certain things. For example, if you want to add two numbers, you say add a comm, b. So basically a will have a value, b will have a value and then you add them. Now even that was not comfortable. We wanted to build huge applications and that's why we moved from one language to other languages. Things started evolving and then we got one perfect language which is C and C++ and they were working fine. But then it's difficult to learn C and C++. somewhere we need a easier language to work with. That's where Python came into picture. Now it's a language which is high level that means it is very near to English that means whatever we we see there you will feel okay that's a English language it's just that when you write that code that code gets converted into a machine code so yes there is someone who will convert that maybe an interpreter or a compiler we'll talk about that those things later but we need someone who will convert that so you write a high level language which is similar to English and when it runs on the machine that's where it gets converted or before you run it on the in it gets converted. Next, we talked about general purpose language. That means using this language, you can build any kind of application. It's not specific to one thing. Maybe if you want to build a simple calculator which works on your machine, we can do that. If you want to build a web application, you can do that. If you want to build a AI based application, you can do that. So, we can use it everywhere. I mean most of the places. Then we talked about different paradigm. See the thing is different languages follow different paradigm. Uh so we have this concept of procedure oriented programming where you work with procedures. We have a concept of object-oriented programming where we have objects. So example for procedure we got C language. For object we got Java, C. uh then we got uh functional programming where you work with functions and that's example for that would be JavaScript but Python says I can do all okay so it's a multi paradigm and of course it's not like other languages cannot work with other type so few languages do support other types as well so yeah that's about Python is very very famous and the question is why it is famous there are multiple reasons for it now before we talk about it let's go to python org and in this series I might say Python Python that fine different pronunciation for the same thing. Now if you go to this website this is where you can download the tools to work with Python and if you see what they're talking about is this. So use for Python language we can use it for web development using there's a library for that or framework we got Django we got flask ornado and for you can also build a go application maybe it will make much more sense in the world of AI now uh using using this tools so we can also use it for scientific and numeric purpose where you you might have heard about sci-fi or pandas if you are exploring the AI world uh we can also use it for software development of course and for system administration but majorly it's very famous nowadays because of AI but also for web development understanding about why it is so famous because of multiple things the first one is it is one of the easiest language to work with in fact the founder of Python Gudo van Rossum basically built this language so that anyone can learn programming languages not be only for specific people so it's the easiest language to work with and you will see why I'm I'm saying that next it has a huge community. So basically any language when you talk about and if they are famous is because of their community or maybe they have a good community because they're famous. Okay, it's a cycle basically but you have huge community and you got lot of libraries to work with. So it doesn't matter in which domain you're working with, you will see some libraries there and in the AI world most of the libraries are built in Python. Now I know you are excited for the code and we'll do that from the next"

So in the last two year itself I help almost more than 2,000 students. Oh about the salaries what's the salary range >> motivate me to get into data engineering but then since we were talking and you talked about data I was able to connect to 2014. So I'm curious what exactly is data engineering? >> Uh so as you mentioned what is data engineering? You know you can understand data engineering is like okay welcome back everyone. My name is Raven Ready and today we got Deep who is expert in data engineering and okay so when I say expert none of them are expert but we can manage things right. So thank you so much for coming on the platform. >> Thank you. Thank you Nal for inviting me. >> Oh it's pleasure. And before we start, I would like you to introduce yourself in let's say I will give you a challenge in in 20 words. >> Okay. So um my name is Deep and uh I've been doing data engineering, data science related technologies uh from almost more than a decade now doing corporate training and running a small company as well as called data maros. So we have been you know doing data related stuff. >> Okay. Don't worry, I was not counting 20 words. I did in my mind but anyway. Okay. So that's about the pesh and maybe he has because of the 20 words he was he was I think he was also counting. Okay. So uh why we are doing this podcast is because when he mentioned that he is into data engineering first of all we met in one of the uh project before and then when when he mentioned that he is into data engineering I was bit curious and I started asking some questions and then we thought okay not just me a lot of people might be having the same question and let we thought let's address that and I wrote that those questions on this paper I'm going to refer that uh but then before we start in In fact, in 2013 or 14, I was reading an article. I I had a big uh craze of reading magazines in 2013 14. You know those tech magazines >> uh from Linux, from uh Digit >> and in one of the article it mentioned that the highest paying job currently in India was for Hadoop developer. And I was like what is Hadoop? I bought the book. I looked at the certification. I think uh Clouda and Hoten works these are true. And I started reading the books. I started in fact I also bought the certification so that I will give in 6 months. I started reading book. I I got my friends because we have to study in group right alone you can't. And then I realized working in a group is of no use with your friends. Uh and I completed half of it but then because of some other project I was not able to continue. And then I realized after a few months or years uh that people are shifting from Hadoop to Spark. That's what I got hurt. I'm not not sure. And then I thought okay, I lost my dream. I have to focus on things which I'm doing. Uh but then since we were talking and you talked about data, I was able to connect to 2014. So I'm curious what exactly is data engineering. >> Uh such impressive question you asked. Uh so well uh as you mentioned that uh in back in 2013 itself you heard about Hadoop and you know you wanted to learn. So well learning is uh you know a under construction path you know uh and learning data engineering I can call it is always under construction path. So you have taken the very first initial step in Hadoop >> that was the of course the very uh you know the that point of time it was the very new technology for uh data engineers and everybody is upgrading on that. Uh so as you mentioned what is data engineering? You know you can understand data engineering is like you have a bunch of you know like stuff in your big messy room. >> Now and uh you want to make it structure at some place so that it should look neat and clean. >> So data engineering is like you have ample amount of data. Okay. And that ample amount of data you are structuring, cleaning, transforming and uh making it useful for someone who can analyze like a data scientist can analyze or a business intelligence person can analyze. So that is a a short description about a data engineering. >> Okay, makes sense. In fact, currently I'm exploring AI engineering and then uh the entire process. uh so what I thought is when I wanted to get into AI I thought I will start with machine learning and then because most of the road maps talks about uh learn machine learning first and before you do that you have to learn maths and then somewhere uh I read that before you even train the models you have to clean the data and uh when I was referring some Reddit post and stuff they mentioned that cleaning data is one of the most difficult part and you have to use multiple tools is that the part of data engineering or that's So you know just understand you know now in the era of AI when everybody is using uh you know to make it actionable making using for you know analyzing stuff uh consuming for you know multiple thing understand how it is difficult that billions of parameter of data when every single organization like you know everybody is using chat jeopardy everybody is uploading some data now understand to structure that amount of data and making it very very precise for your own self. >> You can take an example of Facebook. You know there are on Facebook almost 2 and a half billion people are there. >> How they are managing you know every single profile and they are recommending only those videos and stuff what they are liking on different platforms. So data engineering is you know something that is making it very precise by cleaning the data making it useful for anyone who want to utilize for production. So data engineering is more about extracting transforming and then making consumable for any product. >> Well it is ETL right >> ETL extract transform and load. Okay, with that I I was looking at uh so on LinkedIn I don't know from last few days there's some meme going on >> about ETL and ELS are there any things like that? Yeah. So I heard about UTL but not EL. >> Yeah. So it is something just understand you have you know a very huge amount of uh bucket of data. Okay. One way is you extract the data means you are ingesting the data. Then after ingesting you are not exploring the data in the very first instead you transforming >> and then storing in a structured place >> that is called ETL extract transform and load >> whereas ELT is getting an idea and snapshot of data you know loading first you know maybe in a minute amount or a certain amount getting some idea profiling it and then transforming based on the requirement. Okay. So that's not a meme. That's actually a concept. >> That's a concept. Okay. >> Because I think in data warehouse, if I'm not wrong, when I was teaching databases way back, it's been 10 years, we were we we were teaching ETL. >> But yeah, ELT I thought it's just a meme. >> Okay. So let's let's say in this way I work in Java ecosystem. So whenever there's a new thing in Java, I normally upgrade it. So it can be a framework, it can be a tool or the kind of database you can work with. And in my resume if the moment I say I'm a job developer I have to put those tools there right and I can count 10 tools in a quick way if I give you a challenge to count or to name >> at least 10 tools in data engineering >> and your time starts now >> there's tool names >> okay so there are so many tools not just 10 but I'll name the 10 for you >> so uh in data engineering the very basic uh tool is the programming languages that is SQL so somebody who want to do data engineering they have to learn SQL. Python is the very must language for data engineering nowadays. Uh let's talk about the infrastructure side and the management tools side. So there is Hadoop. Hadoop ecosystem. There is a spark. If I go to the cloud side then on AWS and Azure is so many tools are there for data injection. We have data factory on Azure. Then we have Synapse Analytics for data warehousing. uh not just snaps analytic we have SD insight for complete uh you know uh Horton works and what you have learned no so that has been assimilated inside SD inside itself coming to the AWS infrastructure we have uh there is red shift cluster for data warehousing there is EMR cluster then uh you know we have Kafka sorry kinesis tool that is for data streaming stuff uh then we have data bricks snowflake informatic ICA, Telnet, SSIS, so many tools are there you know so you can count so many things >> so people watching on YouTube comment the number of tools he mentioned because >> purposefully I say 10 but you can't control right so once you talk about your domain and once you talk about tools there are limit unlimited tools I mean in numbers but uh it's difficult to name 10 and still you went beyond 10 uh okay so why I mention about these tools is sometime Do you feel that after completing so let's say we have multiple road maps for one thing so if you want to be a data engineer >> uh so maybe you s you will suggest few tools but then the moment you reach there then you realize okay now it's there are more tools now there are more tools as you go up >> and I think the tools which you mentioned they are still 50% of what is used or they are good enough >> no there are so many tools actually it in a structured process somebody want to learn they cannot learn any tool tool in the beginning or any tool in the end. You know it in a it should be in a structured format. Okay. So you cannot directly learn the snowflake if you don't know anything about data engineering or you cannot directly go and learn uh you know the synapse analytics. There is a structured way of learning. If somebody is a very fresher they should start with some very basic and then reach out there. >> Okay. >> So yeah that is the idea behind the whole structure process. >> Makes sense. There should be a road map video on this. >> Yeah. >> Yeah. There we are going. >> So coming to the next part. So let's say today. So let's talk about road map. So I have worked in the industry for a long time now. I can I know development. I know what's happening there. Or maybe I'm a fresher or maybe I am into college. >> What road map you will suggest to start with and how much time it will take. >> So how much time it will take? Of course it's a anomous question but I can first tell you the road map and then I can give a tentative uh timeline based on uh someone who like you like you learn anything in just one day or two day and then you >> actually it's different it's difference because uh when I learn to make something I can do that in few days but when I want to learn something to teach that's happened by default even if I want to learn something for development still I want to master it maybe one day I want to teach it >> so it takes a lot of time but still let's focus on I'm a developer >> okay so for development side or somebody who's looking to get a job in data engineering I'm making a road map plan for a very fresher person okay so the very first thing you know uh somebody should know what is data engineering in detail so like the very fundamental of data engineering is that you have a huge amount of big data you know uh so data engineering is doing nothing but a data management stuff okay to clean it verify it structure it so that it can consume the problem was why we are using now when we had DBMS or RDBMS thing because it was failing why because the big data uh is too much so much high in volume so much in velocity uh we required some tool that can make it structure for us >> so Somebody should know why data engineering is actually required. And once they understood the very fundamental like how Google very first announced their uh you know the challenge within their organization >> they introduced uh a Google file system challenge to structure it. So they should know about what was the journey behind >> that map reduce. >> Yeah I was able to connect now 10 years ago. >> 10 years ago but yes it's been somewhere 2004 they have introduced this uh map reduce stuff. So somebody should know why data engineering the concept of database management system and what we are using now after understanding this very fundamental programming language called SQL. So all those basic thing like read, delete and update doing group by and uh rank window function some advanced concept of SQL as well as >> okay >> after somebody understood about basic of SQL that is enough you know whatever I just said that is enough >> uh then you should know about Python you know somebody who's wanted to learn a Python programming fundamental >> okay >> so in Python of course the basic thing like data types list tpple dictionary you should know about a biton functions loops all those fundamental stuff. Apart from that, I will suggest somebody should learn about some statistics, mathematical concept because as a data engineer, you are dealing to transform the data. So you need to make some relationship. So some statistical concept somebody should understand like you know descriptive statistics or inferial statistics you know some some mathematical concept is of course there after >> I'm just counting how many things I know SQL done, Python done, basics of stats match done. Okay. So I Okay. Now moving forward uh once you understood those fundamental of course some pandas and uh numpy package of python you know that is something you know already then moving forward the very important fundamental that is called data modeling. >> Okay. >> Okay. So in data modeling uh somebody should know the concept of how data warehouse is being created. >> You know what is the difference between OLTP and OLAP. you know how the RDBM is doing for transaction purposes and how the analytical purpose data warehousing is being used >> right >> okay so concept of data warehouses must because you have to make the data structured over there once you understood the concept of data modeling like you should know about the schemas of data warehouse like snowflake schema star schema fact constellation schema these are some certain way of arranging the data >> okay >> yeah I was good till pandas Okay. So, uh we were using some conventional tool earlier like we were using SQL uh you know like I think developer tools for SQL we were using for all those basic things like SSIS and SAS packages. >> But these were the conventional architecture. Then the main part come that is the big data fundamentals you know and which we got to understand about the concept of big data. how the big data is necessary for us because if there is a big data we can get too much insight out of it. So a good fundamental of big data like um the basic thing like how as I mentioned Google picture of map reduce and all then what you learn already that's called Hadoop you know >> yeah basics I'm good >> yeah so uh somebody should know about the Hadoop fundamentals because from there the whole journey started you know what is Hadoop 1.0 2.2 to what is the concept of HDFS map reduce >> you know yarn you know it's a cluster manager how to managing the stuff moving forward uh you know since Hadoop is itself is not being used in industry very much nowadays because Hadoop is slow comparison to the current tool that we are using that's called spark >> right >> you know so it is almost 100 times faster than Hadoop >> that hurts now that's why I left Hadoop in between yeah >> so uh map produce is slower than spark come into the picture so spark fundamental Spark is something very much used in industry nowadays. >> So uh somebody should understand the whole architecture of a spark. Then moving uh forward uh pi spark you know python plus spark because that's what somebody going to program into that. >> Yeah. So before spark I think Hadoop was done in Java right because I was very comfortable with it. >> So uh Hadoop was being developed in Java language. >> Okay. >> Where is Spark is being developed in Scala language. >> Right. Right. you know but people use Python to use Spark >> Park. >> So the good thing with the Spark is comparison to Hadoop. Hadoop for everything we required another ecosystem like if you want to do machine learning with Hadoop you need to use mayhow. If you want to do streaming you have to use uh Kafka or something like that. If you want to use uh you know anything like you want to do SQL with Hadoop you have to use Hive. But here in Spark you have very much everything in there itself. So so many APIs. Cool. >> So spark done. After that you have to >> so that is the fundamental you know very basic thing somebody should learn. After the spark done uh of course pi spark you have to learn then you have to move toward uh towards the cloud infrastructure because industry is not using their on premises these all thing they use cloud services for that. So someone can explore AWS or Azure side you know uh both are very popular uh in India and Asia Pacific countries and other part of the world expect uh US and Canada people are very much using Azure and in uh you know I'm not just comparing how much it is utiliz but Azure is very popular in in terms of data >> any benefits of using Azure over AWS >> yes it's cheap >> okay so it comes down to the money >> money but not just cheap but Azure have so much tool related to you know data engineering >> okay >> so uh if you are exploring Azure uh as a data engineer you need to learn some basic uh data storage data leaks of this like data lake gen one gen two blob storage those basic thing you're going to explore moving forward you will be you know data ingestion tool like data factory is there >> you know how to ingest the data >> uh uh you can also explore their uh ETL tools that is already there. Uh so some of the ETL tool uh is the Azure datab bricks. So data bricks is again a different uh cloud services or uh the complete uh big data management but they assimilated the feature of data bricks inside that. >> Okay. >> So you can use data bricks Azure data bricks synapse analytics. Now they are coming with so many big pass services you know so we can explore those services as well as uh so yeah I mean that is on the Azure side uh we also have a AWS it's still uh not been discussed >> now before we started I thought I will try data engineering but it's too many tools >> uh you know there are so many tools and uh you know why it is uh important to look around it being a data engineer because uh these tools tools nowadays very much capable to do the task in lesser time you know so you can quickly utilize those tool once you experience it make your life very easier so it's not so something you should not worry about to not start okay so I think it will take time right so it take hardly if somebody is starting uh it takes hardly four to six month in >> to get started and to start comfortable with making projects >> that's perfect Okay. So let's move towards AWS now because I'm more interested in AWS because normally when I make application if I want to deploy in fact all the disco applications are deployed in AWS >> and I thought uh in fact when we were discussing before and when you mentioned that Azure is more popular in Asia specific compared to AWS >> so let's say let's go back to as tools there >> okay so uh in data engineering the very fundamental thing is to make a pipeline kind of data engineering is first you ingest the data. Okay. You extract the data then you load into any uh you know data lake. Okay. So for data injection we have two types of data injection process. One is a batch data injection and one is the realtime data injection. >> So for batch injection also there are so many tool in AWS. Okay. So you can even ingest uh using uh their kinesis tool. There is batch injection you can do and streaming injection you can do. Not just that but you can also use uh uh you know there is a glue services you know AWS glue so you can ingest uh from there. Uh then there are some transformation tool you know ETL tools are there like glue data glue of AWS is there. If you are using infrastructure side then you can use EMR cluster elastic map reduce. >> Uh for data warehousing we have uh red shift cluster. Uh then for storage of course Dynamob uh so many tools are there so somebody can explore but one one thing that I before you ask me a question the most important part is once you do the whole data engineering you have to make the data visible for managers >> for do for actually look around the BI part >> right >> so uh you can use either powerbi in AWS they have their own uh visualization tool you know that's called quicksite so somebody can also upgrade on that. >> Okay. So many tools but again I think uh as you mentioned before if we go in structure where things will make sense uh just listening to the terms it's >> it's very bulky but yeah it should be easy once you start once you get started. Okay. And of course I will not be doing that continuously. I will be doing in part-time whenever I get free time I will explore one tool. Yeah. Not to teach but at least understand how the market is going. Cool. As we discussed uh things there are multiple tools and I think in development also we have different roles right we got testers we got developers for development purpose and uh we have people who can get the requirements we have front end developers in data engineering do we have different roles or once you become a data engineer you are called just data engineer that's a good question because see as a data engineer you are a data engineer but on certain level you know somebody who started is behave like as a data engineer associate. those who work the most you know uh then you know there are some authority level uh data engineer terms come into the picture you know you are more like as a data governance people those who are managing the whole infrastructure giving them IM access and all those stuff >> and uh you know you're making a good ETL pipeline so you become a complete architect level data engineer making a complete scalable pipeline so as you grow as you learn more your roles responsibility changes you are more towards creating the whole infrastructure because uh most of the data engineering stuff is on cloud side >> and you company has to pay for it >> right >> so how to make a scalable pipeline is what the senior people do >> makes sense so it depends upon the number of experience you have and the tools you know >> that's true so now let's move towards the scary part which is AI and developers are scared >> trainers are scared because now we used to teach on YouTube or maybe in a classroom But looking at the chat GPT AI mode where you can or study mode where you can learn things from AI and I think AI is getting popular in different domains will is it impacting data engineering fields or can data engineers use AI tools to make make them more effective? Uh that's a very good question Naven because uh you know AI is somehow uh impacting every single roles you know when we say impacting that does not mean they are taking job they are actually in some fields of course low-level jobs they are taking majorly in Java but not in data >> so you came back to Java it's it's time for us to attack Pythons >> no so especially Especially when we talk about data engineering you know so as the data growing the role of data engineer are keep increasing >> now what AI is doing in data engineering how it is impacting so what kind of programming you are doing that's what you can do that with AI >> so what is happening uh I have just recently uh been in PWC I've been training their employees on how to use data engineering uh AI in data engineering So uh what what is the core idea behind uh those technical trainings is we have been teaching that how they can use the SQL using natural language. So while they're making the uh ETL pipeline they use SQL or PIS spark or whatever. >> So how they can use AI and generate a NLSQL natural language to SQL query >> these kind of things. >> What is that? NS >> NLSQL >> NLSQL. Okay. and LSQL uh not just this uh but with the help of AI how we can generate a synthetic data >> you know because as a data engineer you always in a lost of so much of relevant data >> right >> so we generate synthetic data and uh AI actually helped for synthetic data generation >> uh apart from this using the scalable to make a scalable pipeline uh we use nowadays uh agentic AI >> to create a proper ETL you know stuff in a more prepared way. So you can scale the infrastructure using AI. So that's what we started integrating. >> Okay, perfect. And also data engineering is important for AI engineering. >> So how will you get data if I and how will you train your models if data is not >> not there? Perfect. Uh so let's come to the certifications now because when I started Hadoop my mind was only about uh doing certifications. I don't remember which certification I bought. Is it cloud or hoten works? >> I think hotworks H Hotton works bought cloud or vice versa. >> No. Uh I think Horton works has been acquired by uh Azure. >> Now they assimilated the feature of Horton works in SD inside. >> Okay. >> It is something like that. Maybe I'm not sure please comment it. >> Yeah. >> So let's say if I want to do data engineering now and so I have two questions. One does certification help to get a job? If yes, uh what certifications you would recommend? Do certification help getting a job? 100%. So in the last two year itself I helped almost more than 2,000 students or the employees to get certified in data engineering. Now what all the different certification itself uh in the last week and been doing I'm doing a training in which I'm uh upskilling uh more than 300 people to get certified. >> So what are the certification is there? So nowadays for data engineering in industry people are using very much data bricks you know so they are using platform so either they are using Azure AWS data bricks or snowflake or maybe informatica >> so one of the most popular tool these days is data bricks you know for data bricks there are different level of certifications are there so somebody can start with associate level data engineering certification or data bricks that's actually you know make you stand out to get a job because that is the prerequisite for any data engineer nowadays. >> What's the cost? >> Uh it is somewhere like uh I think $1200 US maybe. >> Yeah. So I mean about I think certification cost never changes. I think I paid the same amount in 2014. >> Yeah, >> that's cool. Or 16 if I'm not wrong. >> Yeah. near about uh and uh not just datab bricks but we have uh uh DP23 that's the Azure uh platform for getting certified in data engineering similarly we have in uh AWS uh also in GCP uh so different platform but the most popular one being a data engineer and you know look data bricks is very much being utilized as >> my concern with company side certifi certification let's say data bricks or this is what if you switch to some other tool or if you get a job with using data bricks I mean you got certification you are working on data bricks now and now you want to switch a company and that company is using some other tool so will that certification of data bricks will be used there >> okay so I'll tell you the basic fundamental programming of data engineering is spark >> and datab bricks is using only spark >> to do the whole projects you know whatever you do so in either you go any xyz company most of The chances are 95% you'll be using data bricks of course. >> Okay. >> So datab bricks is very must. Apart from that you can use infrastructure other infrastructure either for data injection data warehousing and so on. So somebody can take other certification like 2 or 3 you know they can go for AWS certification for platform difference that's all. >> Okay. >> So that does not make much difference. These are the thing that you should have. >> But you can say like some additional tools you can certify like snowflake is getting very popular in in different part of the world in data engineering. So they can actually register for snowpro certification basic level certification as well as >> okay >> or maybe Informatica. >> So do they still do the certifications in the center or they >> no no you can actually enroll based on your requirement and give the exam anywhere. you know there are some center uh they also give from Pearson and something but apart from that you can you know just enroll and then schedule your time and then you can so it's like chill relax >> because from my career start of the career I wanted to certification I tried for jaw certification never gave the exam I tried for Hadoop never gave the exam I tried for blockchain for hyperledger fabric I never gave the exam but I bought all the certifications exam >> afterwards >> I'm like that person who buys gym subscription ions and never go there. So >> you're you're telling me. >> Okay. And now let's come to the most important question. I I'm not sure if you have discussed about this uh about the salaries. What's the salary range? >> Motivate me to get into data engineering. >> Okay. So um see data engineering uh previously was not the entry- levelvel job initially >> but now data engineering become the initial level job you know so if I say that uh you know companies have started hiring freshers into directly as a data engineer so I recently trained a group of I think 300 people for cap jam >> also in the last few years so many fresher level training happening. So the entry- level salary if somebody is very fresher they can expect salary ranges between 8 to 10 lakhs or 12 lakhs in between. >> Okay. >> So that's a entry level. >> Yeah that's rupees. >> That's rupees in India. Uh and similarly if we talk about in US it started from $85,000. >> Okay. And uh as you experience let's say two three four experience you can expect somewhere like 15 to 20 lakhs in three four years of span of time because data engineer job is very much high in demand these days you know everyone says that you know from their own domain but yeah it makes sense because of AI they need data and you are helping AI to progress. So that's a good salary that's a good motivation to explore data engineering. >> Cool. A lot of things to a lot of things I've learned today but I'm also scared looking at the tools but I think when we get started it will make sense. >> Yeah somebody has to start to know see how this is happening. >> Yeah. So I'm good with the first few tools which you mentioned uh SQL done python done uh python pandas still done stats mats I can manage >> uh hadoop basics I know I think I've also started with spark but I've never went deep into it. So I think basics I can manage but the other tools which you mentioned uh I think I have to spend another six seven months to get get there. >> No so uh one thing like if somebody is starting from very uh you know he's just starting up so uh they can expect to cover up the whole big data in around 6 month. >> Okay. But uh in six month of time you have to of course uh do some projects at the same time to get some industry level you know understanding and experience. >> This is where I'm confused. So when you say development it makes sense you can make a project you can deploy it on the cloud. Uh but data engineering needs data right? So do you have a public repository where you can find data and work work on it? >> Yeah. So uh you know like that's where the nowadays the TI is helping too much you know where we can generate a lot of synthetic data you know uh but apart from not just synthetic data but uh what we do generally when we train uh any students or like fresher or maybe anyone so we take some open source data that is available on so much of repository like Google data set have their own data set search engine we have Kaggle where you can get lot of data over there so Kaggle right >> yeah then there are some opensource those datas are available let's say you can check the UCI repository you can check some uh you know let's say any government organization they publish the data >> okay >> uh the most the most uh useful data and people are making project like there is a New York taxi data set is there people are using as a data engineer this for every projects most of the projects uh so there are so many opensource data people are doing it and we are helping them in that way >> oh that's perfect so now we can build applications Uh so yeah that's about my questions and of course you might be having more "

So, uh comp one computer i5 and comp 2 computer reason 3. And then I was trying it on my VS code with the copilot on and then I realized whatever code it is suggesting it's from my videos and this is not the first instance. If you look here I have created so many files and I was I kept my co-pilot open and basically it was just suggesting all the code from my videos. It's funny because co copilot is suggesting your own code and it's scary. I don't know how it is getting trained on what data. Anyway, YouTube videos are public, but what about your private data?"

Uh but every Saturday we used to go live for the quizzes. Last week we did it on a platform and I thought I forgot to mention that in on YouTube and this time we are going we are going to do quiz there but then we thought before we do that people on YouTube should know uh and I'm talking I I don't see people joining. I'm not sure if YouTube has sent uh this. Okay. Uh cool. So if you can see the live, let me know in the chat. >> Um this kind of live looks fun where you can connect and we can discuss. Okay, a lot of people have joined now but the count is not showing on YouTube. This is weird. I think I'm going live on YouTube like this after a very very very long time. Normally we use the cameras and things but here I'm using my mobile camera to go live and this is fun. Okay. Uh hey hi hello hello everyone voice of har crazy says naman oh thank you cool so this time we are going live and we'll be doing quiz on genai and where it is going to happen it is going to happen on the risk platform you will find the link in the description provided the team has done that uh pravin chri says hi hi sir nav nice to see you uh pravin are you the same one who made content for us two years ago. How are you? I'm good. I'm good. Oh, thank you. Your content thing I mean your code is still getting used in the microservices. Franc says so today we are going to learn about Django. Django is a framework. No, no, no. We are not we are not going to uh learn Django. So recently I made a videos for fast API which is there on the YouTube channel. Okay. Question is it worth to learn Java Spring in 2025 or Python for a IML? See that depends where in which way you want to get into. So if you want to get into enterprise uh you need to know frameworks and the most famous framework there is Java. I mean spring with Java or Kotlin. So if you want to get into enterprise do that also learn AI engineering with it so that you can build AI capable application. Uh but if you want to get into a IML then of course you should go for Python now and you should be good. Uh stream API video J I mean Java stream API video is already there right? I've learned a lot from your videos. Thank you so much. Oh, thank you so much, Pratika. Should I learn Java or learn AI? Again, that depends upon uh which field you want to get into. So, I would suggest everyone to get into AI engineering. Uh learn the con concepts, how LM works, then how to do prompt engineering, what what are rags, what are vector databases, what how do you do embedding, how do you run the Olama server on your machine, how do you connect with it. So if you know those concept doesn't matter in which field you are you can use them. Uh Adam says please make more tutorial for fast API. Uh the thing is fast API was never a planned series. I was doing something I was making some project and then I was using fast API there. I thought since I'm already working on it I can simply make videos. uh not entirely but basics because see to create the entire full-fledged course takes months uh if it is a very good course where I have to do a lot of research it takes five to six months and for fast API if I try to plan that then there's a huge cue of the topic which I want to cover and that's why I said okay let me just make uh basics one uh everyone if you like this format of going live which looks good on mobile phone hit that like button Uh Abdul says or asking what Tellesco means. Taliso is basically a Telugu word which means get to know. I say okay Guru says okay questions are going quickly up now. Uh your videos is awesome. Krisha clear. Thank you so much Guru. Uh Anish says Wenut Subrian love that session his gem and you too. Thank you so much. I'm a big fan of Ekkat Subramanyam. Uh why Indians strong in programming? Do they learn from early age? I think it's it's more about we are anyway good with maths by default not everyone but we are good with maths which makes our logical thinking better and when we start learning programming it makes our programming better. But again if you look at world level people don't appreciate Indian Indian Indian developers they appreciate Indian minds but not Indian developers. Uh there are multiple reasons for it. One uh few people they just learn the basics of programming and then not no good practices and they start building applications and they create messy code or dead codes. So that's why we are not well known for good code. Uh when are you going to release AI engineering material videos? That's in again uh the thing is I wanted to get into AI engineering videos and I'm still the plan is to start from uh after 10 days. Now I'm currently busy recreating the Python series for Hindi channel as well as English but not on the channel because we already have it. Uh maybe it will go on Udemy and our platform. So we are still into planning but first once the code is ready or the course is ready you will get to know. Uh Namin Kumar says AI is equal to software industry. See not exactly AI whatever you are listening is more of a hype than the actual implementation but yes it is very helpful you can do a lot of stuff with AI but the way everyone is projecting AI that's not where we are going and I just want to check once H if you can hear from both the ears can you hear from both the ears it's proper right it's not like mono from one place Okay, cool. AI slop uh in in terms of funding there might be some issue but technology wise it's very good. Yeah, the the way they they were showing that you know it will grow exponentially. No, that will not happen. It will grow grow slowly but it's very promising. Okay. How to be good in ReactJS? See whenever you want to get I mean be good into first you need to learn the basics implement project and share your knowledge. When you teach you understand things better. So the first step would be uh understand the framework or understand the tool work on it build projects then you are good and what makes a developer good is the confidence not how much things you know because nowadays you know you can you can get help from chat GPD and other stuff what will help is that confidence example at this point I am not let's say I'm not good with rust okay so maybe I'm not good with go I know the basics of it I and manage uh building a project but I'm confident enough that I can build a project in go language using some framework or maybe in rust using some framework because I know how to make applications. So it's more about confidence than uh the actual tool. What do you think about quantum computing and quantum machine learning? I have not got much into it very much interested and I think it will be good in few years at this point. it's not fully there. I think the major problem is where will you do the computing part? You need those big servers, big players. Uh there are a lot of complications with quantum computing. A lot of variables are there. Big companies can they can do it. Uh last I heard was from Google and D-Wave that they have implemented quantum but no one else is doing it. Okay. Java is awesome. Yes, Java is always awesome. Uh, Nathan says, ""Are you a Telugu guy? Why don't you make videos in Telugu?"" Okay, so maybe you will hate me for this. Uh, but I am Telugu. I was born brought up in Maharashtra. I speak Marathi more than Telugu. And uh, I mean I can manage Telugu. I can talk in Telugu. But then before teaching I have to first learn Telugu properly before I teach it. That's one of the concern I had. Okay. So many layoffs due to AI. Is that true? Will like will it get job? See most of the companies are into that testing phase where they can basically try uh AI replacing people but then few companies realize they can't remove the entire workforce. So they are looking for people who can make applications also knows AI and maybe they are using AI as an excuse to lay off. Which pl which place in Maharashtra? So I was born in Mumbai but currently I'm staying in Pune. Okay. Please create Python for program like Java. Program like Java for program. So I didn't get you Ainand uh start web development on back end side. I mean yeah if you look at my Java series that's what I've done. So we call spring framework but the entire thing is running in the back end. Uh spring boot road map. So spring boot road map is first you complete code java understand the basics of maven uh or griddle whatever build tool you want to go for and even in kojava you don't have to master it but oops concept then uh exception handling a few design patterns before you start spring would be good and then you can start with spring and whatever comes inside spring you can go with Okay. So, retouch. No, don't do retouch. Okay. So many questions. I'm just scrolling. I should have started slow mode. Uh is cyber security a good career? It's you know cyber security is a good career from last 15 20 years. Okay. So it's like a place where see every time you get some new features any new kind of thing example blockchain or AI every time you get new technology it creates new risk and that's why cyber security people are always in need. It's just that the way cyber security was happening few years ago is different from what is happening now. So you just have to keep updating and you you're good. Can you share about hive and kubernetes? I'm not into that much so I can't talk about it at this point. Maybe I should do podcast with people who are good with this. Is quantum machine learning is new technology to learn after a couple of years. Maybe maybe I don't even know which mic is getting used. Is it this mic is getting used or the uh phone mic is getting used. Let me just try it out. U hush if if you can check the quality level changing or not. If I keep this mic very far and because I'm doing this after a long long time. So this mic is connected with my phone and I'm talking very closely. >> Wireless mic, right? You you saw that change happening, right? Okay, perfect. I should do this type of live mode. Uh today we are doing it on YouTube. Next time we'll do it on Instagram. And Hush is telling me to go live on Instagram from a very very long time. You're telling me to go on live on Instagram, right? You know the problem is once you start focusing making more videos then you your entire focus goes there. Okay everyone hit that like button. I can see a lot of people are watching this but then the no likes. How should I learn spring boot? It's very easy. Just complete uh okay you know express right? understand the basics of Java and then you can get started with spring boot directly and I do have a video on spring boot you can use that okay the questions are going very fast how do I on this slow mode now hers can you just make this as a slow mode I can't see questions it's popping very fast you know on desktop it's actually good because I can there's a big window for the chat I can see the questions on phone it's difficult. Okay, finally slowmo is on. Thank you so much. Uh any plans for system design course for experience? Uh yes, it's into the plan but uh Heather is responsible to do that and I hope Heather will do that soon. Uh fresh tech update says thank you so much sir. You helped me to clear BSC, CSCI and MCA also done. Oh that's great. Congrats spring bootle so spring is actually simple provided you go step by step so when you watch the video which I've uploaded it's not like this is the best video but then I can watch my own video to learn now so it's helpful for me should be helpful for you uh what is good rust or java if you want to get into enterprise market learn java and if you want to get into system engineering get into Rust complete code Java Java course available. Yes. Uh ReactJS video when you are doing I'm not into much into front end. uh I use React to build application but I don't teach it because at this point with this amount of load I have I don't want to get into React take out taking out six months and teaching it there are so many things in Java itself which I'm busy with and AI uh Aino says done with your 48 hours springboard okay so yeah the 48 hour video which is actually two days video is uh it has everything it has Java the entire entire Java right Java Spring Boot Maven JUnit everything and then when you click on that video it says two so I think people think it's two hour video apart not 48 hours video because it's it says 2 days is Java still usable why Not most of the enterprise spirit are still in Java. Okay. Uh Har says uh because I lost my hair in the early age. So instead of keeping half I keep prefer it keeping keeping cool uh clean and there there are a lot of advantage of this you know you don't have to uh it saves your time it saves money as well says do you live in baneer yes currently I'm living in baneer I want to know your take on Azure it's a good cloud platform I don't know why I I personally don't like uh windows products or Microsoft products but it's a good product. I have worked with open shift. I have worked with AWS bit little bit of Google or GCP but hardly once or twice with Azure and that too for if if a client says we need to work on Azure I do that otherwise preferably I use always yeah AWS okay so there's there's a one question or one thing iPhone 6E is a goat probably I'm using iPhone 16. Okay. So the phone which I'm through which I'm going live is 16. So 16 is good phone. Never tried 6e but I'm very uh I'm waiting for 17 air. It looks good. Uh which language can I learn to place in product based companies? See it's not about the language. Most of the companies are not looking for people who knows a language. They're looking for people who are good with thinking. They know bit of DSA, a bit of system design and any language but you should be good with that language and made projects with it. The only thing is once you get hired most of the companies are using Java. So anyway you have to learn Java later. So why not now? Okay. So I have seen this. So when I go for corporate training uh and I see big companies are using Java there and when I talk to the participants they're like we have learned Python or maybe JavaScript in the college and now uh we have to learn Java as well and then I think what if they have learned Java before you know they can start working on the project from day one. Uh I bought your springboard course on Udemy. Oh that's great. I hope you're enjoying it. uh infra or dev who is earning more that depends upon the company depends upon how much responsibility you have. So money is not same everywhere I have uploaded few videos on Java but then we have removed it because we are not able to complete the entire series. Uh can we use MacBook Air M4 for development? I have used Windows for four years. Yes, you can. Uh see MacBook Air M4 with 16 GB RAM is more than enough to do uh development work including Docker. I have tried it. I don't have M4. I have M3 and it supports. So M4 should work with it. Uh so I got M3. Uh it has 16 GB RAM. The only problem is I can't record videos on that. So for video recording for learning the models is not sufficient but apart from it it's a very good laptop. Uh do you know Telugu? Okay. So a lot of questions on Telugu. I can manage Telugu Java math. Okay. Uh, hi Naveen. I'm done with your 48 hour spring boot video. What can I do now? Can you suggest some project or something which I can do? So if you once you are done with it, I would suggest you to start building project. Whatever project which comes to your mind. uh maybe on in your daily life you whatever problem you can see uh one of the thing which we wanted to do is in our office we basically use uh we used to use Jira but now we are using Zoho board and uh if I want to build a project now I will build my own dashboard for the you know task assignments and stuff so think about your perspective whatever you want to do now or whatever problem you're facing just build the project and you can once you know the concept basic concept you can you can use AI now maybe a copilot or something and then start using it spring boot versus nextjs wish to choose both are good uh depend upon where you want to work in future spring is solid in that terms but if you join a company where they're using nextjs of course you should know you should know nextjs I have seen you somewhere don't know where maybe on YouTube normally this question should be coming when you meet me in person so whenever whenever someone meet me in the public places when they say okay I have seen you somewhere I say YouTube now if you're asking me this question on YouTube uh maybe you have seen me somewhere uh so let's say is feeling stress has forgot everything even after having an idea of Java. See whenever you learn something you will remember that for some time but if you want to remember that for a longer time then you need to uh you know build projects write articles on it make videos don't make videos on YouTube for others maybe do it for yourself for your learning purpose uh Ruby on Rails current market no idea no idea because every time I hear Ruby on Rails I have one trend uh in in middle college days he was very bullish on lub on rails we need to check with them uh why do not upload devops course in Udemy so it's in building uh ude deops course is building so you will it will go live soon live major says JWT token refreshing bro yeah yeah uh that's into the plan and the only thing is there are so many things I have to So everything is lined up now. What is the ideal time to switch a company? Whenever you get a good offer. Uh see for me it's not about I mean of course the offer should be good but not in terms of money. The offer should be good in terms of the opportunity you get there and what kind of project you'll be working on. So if you switch to a company where you're getting a good package but not a good role then I don't think it's worth switching because in the initial life initial time of your career focus on projects not on money. Once you get that skill, then you can jump and ask for good money. Oh, where to learn and which language to choose for system design? Can't recommend that, but Java works everywhere. Are your video fast API basics? Will you continue with fast API in depth and go into the building production level project? Uh no that's not the plan at this point. Uh fast API was just for the basics for someone who want to explore fast API and I believe once you know the basics you can explore things by yourself and that was the idea behind it. Spring boot with Kafka video again plan in plan. So basically there are a lot of things in planned for spring uh spring profiling uh spring JWT bit advance and then spring with Kafka and grad also but let's see how when I can do that and trust me video creation takes time because see if you if you just want to make a video I can do that you know I can just uh open my ID and just keep typing and I can make lengthy videos. Okay, I can sit there for two hours. I can teach you the concept which I can teach you in half an hour in two hours. But my preparation is also my preparation also involves how can I save your time. So example, if I'm teaching you Java, I can teach you Java for 30 hours. I don't I don't need preparation for that. What I need preparation for is how can I teach the same concept in LRs so that it will save your time. Um and that's why if you see a lot of lengthy courses there sometime even I feel why why why I don't make lengthy courses because on Udemy normally if you want or any in any platform even on YouTube if you have a longer video and if if people are watching for a long time you do get that ranking but then also you're wasting ing people's time by teaching the same concept in 1 hour what you can teach in 10 minutes. Uh can I start coding from basic in my third year? Yes, you can. You can start any time. It's not like you have lost that opportunity. Uh Ku says, ""I'm a big fan of you. I always recommend your name when it comes to how to learn Java."" Thank you so much. Uh Vikas says sir I prepared an interview for M fullstrike developer but company now says they will give training in SAP need your opinion. See if you love that company if you love your job learn whatever they teach you every new skill is a good skill. Uh where can I deploy my applications for free? You can try Amazon free tires or free. Uh thank you so much Dhu for the super chat. Finally a student with a low CGPA, NodeJS or Spring. Okay, now that's tricky. So when you mention low CGPA, it actually doesn't matter. Now question is Node.js or Spring go with anything but start doing it. Uh I would suggest spring if you want to get into enterprise market and if you want to get into startup or somewhere you can try NodeJS but again that that also depends upon what you know already. If you know JavaScript, go with NodeJS. If you know Java, go with Spring. Okay. But I can confidently talk about Spring because I have worked on it. I have seen the market of Spring. It's huge. AI can replace developers. Uh AI can assist developers. So if a project needs five to six people, maybe three is enough now. So that those two people lost the job or companies will get more projects or they will add more features with those two extra developers. Uh future of data engineering. Okay. So for this Pratik on Monday we are going to upload a video on YouTube about data engineering. So there's a podcast which already got shot and uh there'll be the video will be there. Okay. Uh one more announcement in fact okay let me just reiterate the announcement at 6:00 we are going live on the telescope platform for a quiz. It will be a genai quiz. So how do you go there? Check out the description. there's a link uh click there register for free you don't have to pay for anything for the quizzes and uh every Saturday at 6 p.m. We are going to do quizzes there. We'll understand some concepts. We we'll talk about it. We'll discuss and it's really fun because when you do quiz you will see questions and then you will realize okay there's something which I don't know. You will read about it and you will slowly grow your knowledge in different technologies. And second we have launched our new Hindi channel. Uh check that out. The channel name is Theisco Alien. So go to YouTube and search for theiscoco alien. I think it will suggest you now anyway you are on YouTube. So after this live just search for the alien and videos will be coming in Hindi there. Most demanding technology right now to get a job. uh at this point it's AI but then not see AI is in demand but we don't have enough jobs for it I mean yeah that's an irony okay so people are companies are looking for AI engineer but not lot of companies are looking for it and they don't even they're not even able to find good AI engineers so if you can fill that gap it's good otherwise Java is evergreen Uh why don't you make video in Telugu? Okay, we have talked about it as a fresher it's is it good to start with react next.js project in a comp in company as I'm strong with uh see learning extra technology is always good. So even if you know Java and Spring Boot maybe spend some time learning React and NextJS and vice versa. If you are good with JavaScript and React, learn Java and Spring Boot. Or if you have extra time, Spring is huge. Explore other projects in spring. Uh can you just say namaste in Telugu? Namaskaruma provided that's how you say namaste in Telugu. Okay. Road map of be for becoming AI engineer. Check out my video the check out my video on AI engineering if that is incomplete I'll make a separate video uh with spring react or Java. So spring is a project a framework for Java. Please suggest AI technologies for jaw developer. Step one would be to learn Spring AI and I do have a video on Spring AI. Check that out and you should be good. Uh how Jaw developer can switch to AI? Again, same answer. Learn uh Spring AI and you will you will get to know what else you can explore. Uh last night I purchased your spring boot course from Udemy. Is it possible to get a job from that course? If you do it properly and build projects, you should be a good candidate for them. Uh because of Okay, Sah says because of your videos, I got a job in TCS 7 LPO. That's congrats. You know, this is what motivate us to make more videos and for that this life deserves a like. What's the problem in liking? At least on I think with this kind of format liking a video is very easy, right? You while watching it. Is it easy? I'm not sure. Let me just check it out. >> Not sure. >> Uh, okay. You don't see that like button there. So, you have to close the live chat. >> Then there's a like button. Cool. Um what next? What should I know in Java to get 12 LPA? Okay. Uh see again I don't talk about so if you if you watch any of my video and I have made more than 2,000 videos >> and never in my video I talk about how much package you will get and whoever talks about it they're not they just get their numbers from some website and most of these most of these numbers are not correct. So instead of sharing misinformation I don't even talk about numbers and that depends upon how much you know that depends upon the company that depends upon how you negotiate a lot of factors are there but it doesn't matter what is your package how much your package deserve it's very important for you to become a good developer so learn Java learn spring after watching the videos build projects and that's how you do What is your current role? You're asking me or someone else. My current role is making videos. I'm a trainer. Is Kotlin really replace Java? Not entirely. But yeah, a few projects are moving into Kotlin. But you have to understand Kotlin comes under Java ecosystem. So when we say everyone is using Java even cotling is a part of it. Uh so some demo projects in ReactJS and springboard in YouTube. U you should be able to find them. How's the market for AI? Uh AWS data engineering is good. It's good. Now AI is coming. Do we need to do programming? Yes, you should. Uh, Deepanchu says video. Oh, thank you so much. Uh, Danjit says, can I only focus on DSA without front end and back end? I would I would I won't suggest you that DSA is important, but it's not the only thing important. So if you want to get into a big company or maybe whatever package you're looking for DSA is required because they will be asking questions on that plus they will ask you questions on projects it doesn't matter which language you should be good with it okay Sami says will AI replace cyber security share your views on cyber security field in upcoming years. AI will increase a job for cyber security. Okay, Zong has sent a super chat. Thank you so much. Sait. Super chats are always welcome. Uh sir, Deops future in AI era. It's good. Now you need to learn AI powered DevOps. To to know more, check out our courses. pages. We have came up with a new course AI powered deops. Uh okay says started learning Python from your playlist. Really great. Oh thank you so much. Uh meet up when soon. Just let me know in the chat from which from which location you are watching this. I'm just curious now. Okay. I'm watching your videos since four years. You're a good teacher. I have ever seen. Oh, thank you so much, Wenesh. Thank you. Hyderabad, Nagpur, Hyderabad, Vzac, Pune, Bangalore, Hyderabad. Okay, there's another super chat from saying uh how to start Thank you so much. How to start a channel like yours? It's tricky now. I started in 2014 where we were not having a lot of players in the market and whatever I was doing. So see everyone has a idea behind a channel. So you maybe you follow someone else and then you say okay I want to build a channel like that. When I started the plan was to go fresh the way I want to do it and I started doing it and when you do it it looks different to everyone right and maybe that's why they started following me. When you want to start you have your own style just keep uploading the uploading the videos and look at the response based on the response you can change your style says up Java brains janteo he's also gem in this field like you yeah I know him we have talked multiple times we also did podcast together Koshik and me and he's amazing teacher uh Is your 48 hours complete Java YouTube covers all in the back end enough? More than enough to be to make you a good developer website. Now that's a shock. The website is down. >> Telescope.com. That's a shock. Let me check. telescope.com. It's working. It's working. working. >> And what about courses.com? >> All working >> other working. Course is also working. Maybe you're entering a wrong uh URL. Okay. From West Bengal. Okay. People are joining from all over the place. Nelor. Karthik. I can't read Telugu. I know that's a bummer. Please don't judge me. Okay. Uh I moved from operation to dev because of you. Thank you so much. Oh, thank you so much. Sing. Can you teach full chapters spring and array or maybe your separate video two hours video on that? I should try. Uh sir, you are from which state? Currently I'm in Manastra. I was there in Karnataka for 3 years in Bangalore. Okay. Can you give me quick introduction? Pusham says about me. Okay. So yeah, I've been it's been a long time I've talked about me. So my name is Davin Reddi. I am into training into into development from last 15 years into training from last 11 years now. Worked on multiple technologies. Uh I love exploring technologies because I can also teach them on different platforms like I teach on YouTube the channel where you are watching this. I also teach on Udemy on our own platform which is the.com. U I love exploring technologies. I have worked with Java, bit of Hadoop, then uh Python, Python frameworks, Kotlin, Android. I was a developer for some time then I moved into uh blockchain currently exploring AI. Yeah, that's about me. Uh Wasim says what is more important talent or experience? I would say confidence. uh and I started believing in this from a long time. It's it's more about confidence. Maybe I'm sounding smart to you, maybe I'm not. It's just that I'm showing that confidence. I don't know. So talent without experience is of again no use because if you have not showing your work, what's the use of it? Is it worth learning Rust? I'm not sure. But it this is something which you should explore. Yeah, Golang is good. Uh in fact we also running I mean we also started Golang series on our Hindi channel. So search for Teresco alien channel which is a new channel and you will you will soon find uh Golang videos there. Okay. Uh enough of talking almost more than 40 minutes we have talked. Uh if you like this type of live and if you think I should do that often, hit that like button. I will know that this is working. People are liking this kind of live. And also at 6:00 exactly at 6:00 p.m. IST we are going we are doing a quiz on the platform. You will find the link in description. Enroll for free and you should be and stay on the dashboard. You will see that the live started at 6:00. and join there. Okay, thank you so much everyone. Once again, hit that like button. If you have not subscribed, do subscribe. And yeah, that's it. Thank you so much everyone. Bye-bye."

We got a LTS version after 21. Now in between we got 22, 23, 24 but then we were we have not talked about it much is because those are not LTS version. LTS by the way stands for long-term support and I normally focus on the LTS version. So I was using 17 then I moved to 21 and now I'm going to move on 25. Now looking at all these versions of course they will add some features in the existing things but also they will add some performance improvement or they will do some performance improvement and in this version I can see a lot of things are happening. Now in this particular video we'll talk about what are things which came and what are things will be coming next and also we'll run some code to show you as a learner or as a beginner in Java what are things you are going to see which will be changing. Cool. So the first thing you have to do is you have to get the JDK25 in your machine. You can get from multiple places but I would prefer to get open JDK and you can go to this URL which is jdk.java.net/25 and on this page you can just based on your OS you can download one in this machine I have already downloaded. So basically when you download this zip it will give you a folder and you have to set the path in the environment variables and I think that's straightforward. Now once you get JDK in your machine uh let's talk about the features. Now 25 came up with lot of features but they're not entirely new. Few things started in 21 itself but some are preview some are in incubation and later on they basically make a final version of it. uh example if you look at the encoding and cryptography objects they are still in preview but you can still use it and there are few features which are in preview you can't directly run it in the production application you have to set some parameters for that and I would recommend don't run it on the production for learning purpose it's good they have removed the support for title bit and that's normal I think u next I'm interested in the uh structured concurrency because of the virtual threads when you get so many threads working how will you make it manageable. So uh we can do that. I've not experimented fully with this. Uh I will try out more stuff and then I should make a video. Then there are new things coming in switch but again it's into preview. So we'll not talk about that. Uh vector API is here. So machine learning people talking about Python Java is on the way for that and once it reach to that level it will take over for sure. U then we have the compact source files and instance method. We'll we'll see that and a lot of things in fact I would also recommend you to explore this page of open JDK and uh if you want to know what happened before you can even check those things. I think when you go here for the 24th version this is 24 and then likewise you can go the go to the previous versions. Uh so we got a lot of updates in 25 from 21 because of all this small versions. We got uh virtual threads as we defined we have talked before then we got class file API but I'm going to talk about things for beginners. So let's let's go back to the VS code and let's try out some code. So the first thing is one of the thing with uh Java or people who are learning Java for the first time they are actually scared by looking at the first code. Normally the first code we always do is hello world right. So how do you do hello world is very simple you create a class first you without class this will not work and then you create a method which is public static void main. It's good to write them but to explain this thing to a beginner it's very difficult okay to convince them that you will get used to it and then you have to say system.out.pintil I think I have not installed the extensions for Java I don't use VS code much for Java I use intelligj but then for small code I think VS code looks good so by the time it installs I will type the things by myself so I will say system.out.print print ln and then here you say hello world and whatever you want to print this is your first code in Java right and then if you want to run this uh you have to say java c compile the file then you have to run the file by java command otherwise you can directly run java demo java uh I think this this is something new if I'm not wrong it came in 17 I I don't remember uh but then you can see we got hello world and that perfectly works right now uh What I want to do here is I want to show you what new came in Java after Java 21 I think. So you don't have to if you're learning for the first time you don't have to write the entire code. You can do some shortcut. So you can say void main uh and you don't even have to specify public class demo. So you can skip that. It will create a class behind the scene for you. Uh then you don't need to write public static. You can directly go for void main. You don't have to pass the parameters inside. So you can simply say we are creating a function in which you just want to print something and since we are doing IO operation so you have to say IO dot print len and then you can print hello world. Now before you run this you have to make sure you can see we are getting we are seeing some error here. It says IO cannot be resolved. Uh I think VS code is not updated with the JDK version. And I also want to check what version of Java I'm using. So this is Java 25. It should work. Let me just clear it out and I will say java demo. Java and it works. You can see we got hello world. So this is a small code using which you can print it. Okay. So now we got JShell in long back and for learners even JShell looks good or you can try with this way. But if you're making a production ready project don't do this. Go for normal syntax. This is just for the learners. Next improvement we got is in the unnamed variables. See sometime we create variables just because we have to create the variable but then we don't use it. One of the classic example is exception handling. So let's say if I write here try and in this try I'm trying out something. Let's say I want to uh create a integer and this will be coming from a value like this. Let's say 1 2 3 and you cannot assign this right. So you have to basically do integer dot pass int and that's a standard way of doing this passing the value okay ignore that s this is given by a lot of people get confused this is given by the id is this is not something I have typed so once you got this try in which you are trying this and maybe you don't even want to use that value or whatever you want to do that later but since we have a try we have to write catch and then we say exception e and then we print uh some message here right but And sometime we also use e when type the message I can say invalid value I can say that and I can also print the message right see when you use e.t get message. It makes sense to use this variable e here, right? But what if you don't want to do this and you just want I'm still use this e variable. What if you can skip it? So when I say skip it, it's not like you can keep it empty, but you can use underscore now. So for the unused value and this was not allowed and that's why it says uh underscore is keyword from the source level 9 onwards cannot be used as identifier. Okay. Uh but then this works in JDK 25 and you can see it's not printing anything because we're not storing the value or we're not printing the value. I I could have used io.print ln but let's go for standard way and let me print num just to see something on the console. Uh you can see we got 1 to three but if I make a mistake here of course this will raise a exception and it's it says invite value. So if you don't use e then why to write e there that's what they saying. Uh for me I I I always use exception object but if you're not using it then you can use underscore. What next? Let's do quickly. Let's remove all this stuff. The next thing which we got is for the super method. See whenever you create a class let's say we have a class called parent here. And in this class you have a constructor which is public parent. And in this you are let's say printing something. You are saying in parent and let's say we got a class called child and this child extends parent and here you are saying public child and we got a constructor there. So we know that the first line of the constructor for the child class or any class is super right. So even if you don't mention that it is a super method. Um example let's say if you uh try to print here which is in child and now if you try to run this okay first of all we have to create the object of child otherwise this will not work. I was a child obj equal to new child. I don't know why I'm treating child as an object but anyway so let's run this and you can see it says in parent and in child okay why in parent is because by default it calls this super method even if I don't mention that it is super method so even if I write that it will give the same output now before JDK 25 or when it was released pre-released on stuff uh at least before 17 for sure you can't write anything before super In example, if you want to print something, you can't do that. I can't say before super. So if you do this in before JDK or whatever whenever it was released after 21, uh this was not possible and you can see it still gives you error. It says constructor call must be the first statement in the constructor. So if you run this, it still works now. Okay. So we can do this. Now question is why someone will do that. uh maybe you want to check a particular value before sending to the parent class uh maybe you want to raise an exception if something goes wrong so those thing you can do here but yes you still can't assign a value so let's say I have a parent value here which is int x= 9 and then I can't simply come here by saying x= 8 okay so if you do this it will give you error but can I do this can I just put that after super it works so you can't do assignment ment before the super but you can print you can check for the exceptions you can do those stuff so this is the new improvement in the super method then we got changes in the collection so let go back here and let's create a collection here uh so let's say we got a list here and in this list I'm going to have list of string I will say list equal to new array list and let's say in this I do have a list of some values so we got a we got b and we got c let's say we have this values here And normally when you want to fetch value from the list how you do it so you have to provide the index number right. So you can use index zero, index one, index two. Uh and let's say if you want to fetch the first value, it's very simple. You can say list dot get and you can pass the index zero. That perfectly works, right? It will give you the first value. But if you want to get the last value, you normally fetch the length of the list and then you say minus one then you will get the last value. But now with the new implement you can directly say list dot get first and list dot get last. So if you run this now you can see we got the first value we got the last value. We also got a inbuilt method uh where you can reverse a particular list. So you can say reversed. So it will give you the reverse list C A. So these are the implements which we got. We also got implement in the stream. So normally when you work with stream API and that's one of my favorite whenever you work with stream let's say if you do if you're doing filtering or if you're doing map or if you're doing any intermediate operations so stream works on each value individually you can't basically have a memory of the old values. Now when this will be useful so let's say you got a lot of values for a temperature for the area and I always check a temperature or the current weather every day and if I want to know with all the values so let's say these are the values for the temperature in my area I want to know if the if the temperature increased for three consecutive days or four consecutive days and if it happened I want that values from where to went where where it went so we can't simply do that with the help of uh normal stream methods and that's why we can use something called a stream gatherers where you can create windows and you can compare the windows. Uh if you want to know about it let me know in the comments. I'm very interested in making those videos but I thought I will do that in this video but I don't want to make a two two hour when lengthy video uh which I am anyway doing it. I think it's more than 15 minutes now or 14 minutes by cutting the parts. Okay. So these are the new things. Uh one more one last more one last. So let's say if I remove everything here and let me create a new file let's say hello. Java and in this basically what I'm going to do is I'm going to create a method which is public void show and I'm going to print hello. Okay nothing fancy simple show method and hello. Now this syntax where you can run the file directly using a Java command it's pretty new for few people right? So normally what you do is you write java c then the file name and then once you compile it then you use a java command to run it with whatever the class name is but we got this new syntax but this was working only for one file right but what if what happens if you have multiple files example we got two files here and demo is dependent on the hello so let's say if I create object of hello here and if I try to say obj.ow Show now before this was not working. So it it will ask you to compile the hello file separately. Then you can do this but now we don't have to do that. We can directly run Java demo and this will basically work with both the files. Okay. So these are the new changes in JDK25 or till JDK25 from 2021. Uh let me know if you enjoyed and if you need video on a particular section. So, if I try to create the video or an article on that. Thank you so much."

I welcome you all again to one of the amazing series which is on anible a configuration management tool. We are going to start from absolute scratch. Before we get into the anible playbooks and do something practical with anible first we need to understand what is configuration management? Why we may have to go with the tools such as anible? What exactly is anible? What problem it is trying to solve? Fine. So let's get started directly here to start with right suppose we have certain machines here machines or you can say web servers which is the EC2 machines let me just write the pictorial representation here as you can see on your screen we have certain servers or you can say it is the EC2 machines or instances fine and we have one admin here who have to take care of these machines anything we have to do on to this machine for example I want to deploy one application. If you want to deploy one application, whatever softwares which are required in order to support that particular application has to also be installed in this particular machine. Example, I want to deploy a Java application. Then Java must also be there into that machine or it should be present inside that machine. Right? So basically if you want some softwares to be installed into these EC2 instances or you can say on into the uh servers then we may have to do it manually. Example we have an admin. We have hide an admin to manage all these machines. And the requirement is a basic requirement is I want to install maybe for an instance Java 17 into this machines. Then what to do? You can ask this admin. Then admin will go to this machine and use all the required commands and install Java 17. Again maybe it has to be installed in all the machines. Then Java 17 admin will try to connect to this machine and install Java 17. And here also admin will connect and install the Java 17. And here also we'll connect and install. Here also we'll connect and install. Then this particular admin who is responsible for these machines would try to connect to all these machines and install the required software. What if we have 100 machines? What if we have 200 servers? Then do we have to install the software in all 200 servers? Yes. And imagine this task is getting done manually. Don't you think it is a repeated task? Same task which we have to repeat for n number of times. And maybe right now I have installed Java 17. And the requirement is I have to install now Java 21 or maybe Java 23. Then again we have to update that software or we may have to reinstall again the same task has to be repeated into the all machines. And also it is a timeconsuming process. If it is taking some time to install a required software into a machine then same task if you're doing manually doing that into 25 machines doing that into 50 machines it's going to be a timeconsuming process. It is a repeated task. If you are know trying to manage this configurations manually it is a timeconsuming process. And also if a human being is doing this manually into all the machines there is a high possibility that the mistakes might happen and the errors might occur. Right? There are many disadvantages limitations associated with one you know configuring all the required things for our application manually. We may have to automate the process. So whenever you want to copy certain files from one machine to another machine, you want to do the OS patching or you want to update certain softwares, you want to install new softwares into our machines that can be done manually but it is a timeconsuming process and might be a human error and also it is a repeated task. We have an option to automate this entire process. And whenever you want to automate the process of configuration, the configuration tool comes into picture which is anible. Anible basically is a automation configuration tool which is used for the configuration management. Example, I want to install git into all my machines. I want to install Maven into all the machines which are there in my infrastructure setup for my application. Then you have to automate the process of configuring the required setup using the tools such as anible. So basically anible is an opensource IT configuration management orchestration or deployment tool which is used to automate the process of configuration management. Right? So anible is an automation tool which is used to define the configuration as a code. You can automate the entire configuration as a code with the help of anible playbook. What exactly it is we shall understand. Currently Ansible is own under the ownership of Red Hat. It is an open-source tool and it there is a process which we may have to follow in order to install this. I'll be guiding you on to everything how to install. What is the architect we may have to follow? What is anible playbook? How can we you know automate the entire configuration management as a code? Everything from the scratch we shall explore. Right? So I hope you got to know the purpose of why we may have to go with anible and what problem anible is trying to solve at the fundamental level. Let's understand more onto anible in the upcoming videos. Hello and welcome back. So far we came to one conclusion that anible is an automation tool that provides a way to define the configuration as a code right. So whatever we were doing if you have an admin here which is supposed to install all the softwares maybe copy files from one machine to another no machine or all the configurations which are required is to be done by one admin. Now in place of that we are just going to automate that and to automate this configuration process we have anible. So I'm going to use here anible. So wherever we had an admin that admin is now replaced by anible right and now in this case we will have something called as a playbook because it defines the configuration as a code to write the code wherever whichever file is used in order to write the code to define the configurations required that file technically we call it as playbook. Playbook means it is a file where the configurations which are required is defined in the form of YAML. It is a YAML file yet another markup language YML file or you can say YAML file. So ansible we use YAML file and inside this file in the YAML syntax we define the configuration what is required and we will have one more component here. Name of the component is inventory file. Fine. A host inventory file which anible uses to know on which machine it has to automate the configuration. In which machine it has to do the configuration. Example we have here five machines and inside this three or two machines maybe they have to install Java and the remaining machines maybe they have to in you know install the databases. So we will create the group here. This group is the web server group. I'll say here web server group and this group is the DB server group. We will create the groups. Inside this group there will be certain machines on which you want to perform you want to automate the configuration. Example here onto these two machines I want to install Java. Onto these machines I want to install a database. So what I'll be doing is I'll create two groups. Inside this group I'll keep a machines on which I want to install Java. I'll create one more group on which I'll create machines wherein I want to install maybe any data base here. Now host inventory file will have the information that anible has to perform operation on which machine on which machine the operations or the configuration has to be performed. That information will be available here. And anible uses the playbook. Inside the playbook, a YAML syntax, a code will be present. Which code? A code in the YAML syntax which defines all the configuration. Maybe I want to copy files from this machine to this machine. For which we are going to automate the process, right? We will be writing a code. That code will be present here. Maybe into this machine I want to install Python. So whatever is required to install the Python the code we will be writing in which style we will write the code into the YAML syntax style. So Ansible playbook is used where we define the code we write the code which is required for the configuration management. Whatever we want to do onto the machine that code will be present here and that code whatever we are going to perform onto which machine we have to perform the information will be available into the host inventory file. So this is the basic general structure of the anible. So let me just define few key points here. So far whatever we have understood you can say this is acting like a summary of our understanding so far. So as a summary we have understood that Ansible is an opensource tool or a software which is currently under the ownership of Red Hat and this entire Anible tool is written in Python language. Doesn't mean that you may have to learn Python. It is not required. This tool this software is developed using the Python language. Fine. So Ansible is an open-source IT configuration management deployment or you can say orchestration tool. It is an automation tool that provides a way to define the configuration as a code. And where are we writing that code? We are going to write that code into the playbooks. So, Ansible uses the playbook in order to automate the deploy, manage, build or you know test or configure anything playbook is used. inside the playbook only we are going to write the code which is responsible to automate the configuration management. So basically this is the fundamentals of anible what exactly anible why we may have to go with this the basic architecture of anible and the fundamental what exactly is playbook we may have to understand more on anible in the upcoming video. Now just to add a few points onto the existing discussion we had as a conclusion that anible is used to automate the configuration process and for that we use playbook. Playbook means where we actually write our script write our code what we want to do what task we want to carry out right whether it is deployment or delivery or installation of some software. What configuration management you want to do we define in the playbook. And we have some terms here called as control node and managed node. Managed node means such machines which is managed by anible. Example, I'm going to install the Java or any other software or maybe any configuration management into these two machines using the automation tool such as anible. Since I'm managing these machines using the Ansible, then this can be called as manage nodes. example these all machines I'm going to manage using the anible for the any of the configuration management in that case we can call this as the manage nodes now the machines which are going to manage right these machines we call it as control nodes on which the actual anible tool will be installed we will have one machine on which we are going to install the ansible tool so that we can manage the other machines a machine where we have installed anible to manage other machines for the configuration. Such machine we call it as control load. And how this machine will know on to which machine we have to install the software or which machine we have to the configuration. That information will be available in the host inventory file. So using the host inventory file we will get to know which machines we have to manage. The machines which are getting managed by anible manage nodes a machine which is managing the other machines called as control nodes where the actual anible will be installed. Now which machines to be managed by the anible that information will be available in host inventory file and anible uses playbook in order to carry out the task which we want to perform. Whatever task it want to carry out that task as a code will be available in the playbook. I hope now all the terms control node manage node host inventory file playbook these terms you have got the clarity we have to move ahead in this series. Hello and welcome back. Now we have seen the important components and the architect of the anible. Fine it's time to implement this. First step is to install the required you know softwares or to make an arrangement so that we can practically see this concept of anible for which I'll be creating three EC2 virtual machines on our AWS cloud. Basically I'm trying to buy or trying to create three servers three machines wherein one machine I will consider as my anible the control node the other two machines I'll consider as the manage nodes using the anible how are we going to manage those computers or those servers or you can say those machines. So three machines we may have to create one where we have to install the anible that will act like a control node right the other machines it could be 2 3 4 five depends at the time of you practicing you can go ahead more than two also that should not create a problem that will be called as the manage nodes fine so let me open the browser here I would like to open the browser I have logged into my AWS account you might have the AWS account please do log into that if not you just create the Linux machines, virtual machines, right? So I hope if you are learning anible or terraform or any of the DevOps tool it is basic that you must be knowing the fundamentals of any cloud providers, you must be knowing about the Linux. That is what I have kept in my mind as well. Now you just have to go to the EC2. I have already bookmarked. If not, you just have to search there and then you'll have an option to launch a new machine. Okay, three machines is what we have to create. Right now, I would like to launch it. I would like to give it as maybe nodes. Okay, that's a name initially. Later we can change the name. So that should not create any uh problem. Okay, or server you can say anything that should not be a matter of concern. Now I would like to go with the Amazon Linux. You can go with the Ubuntu or Amazon that is also not a matter of concern. I would like to again uh go ahead with the instance type which is the freight tar. Now key pair is required. So because using the key pair you have to get connected to those Linux virtual machines which you are creating on the AWS right. So this is the important step. You can use the existing uh keys. We have so many keys which I have created. Uh you know I do also take this live classes at telescope. So multiple times we have done that. Now create a new I would like to just go here key pair name and I would like to specify maybe the name as anible key pair. Whatever name you want you can give. Okay. And I would like to create it will be downloaded and available in the download section. Fine. Now after which either you can go and create a new security group or select one existing security group. So that should not again create any problem. I want to go ahead with the default security group which is already there. Okay. And now number of instances you can create this separately one by one. I want to create all three at a time. Three machines we need right. One will act like a control node from where we are going to manage other computers. The two other will act like a manage. The one which is getting managed by the anible. The one which is getting managed by the control node. I would like to go here and click on launch instances. Now three instances will be created. If I have to go to my instances, you'll be able to see here other instances you ignore. We have three instances. server is the name I had given. So what I'm going to do here is I would like to change the name here. Number one, I would like to give the name as the control server is what I have given. I'm just trying to rename it. Okay. And the other the manage one. Okay. I'll say here manage server. Any other name also you can give. So I'm trying to replicate that. Uh this is getting managed by anible. So only I've given the name manage. You can give web server, database server, whatever machines you want. Okay. And one more also would like to just make the changes and it is server number two which is the manage server. Okay, manage node you can give. Okay, that is getting managed by the anible. Done. I have made the changes. Okay, three machines we have created here. And now one by one I would like to get connected to these machines and do some configurations. These configurations step by step please follow. you'll not face any issue to practically apply anible or to practically play around with the anvils. Okay, follow the steps uh very carefully. Now control server control load. I would like to click on this and I want to get connected to it. To get connected to it, if you are using a MacBook, you can use the terminal or git bash. If you're going with the Windows, you can use the git bash also. You can use the mobile XM software that is also one of the you know client software which will give you a terminal to get connected to the virtual machines. Either of that you can follow up to you. Git bash is what I would like to use from the Windows machine. Right now I would like to open where my key value pair is there. Anible key value pair that folder downloads. I'll say right click and show more options. Git bash is there. If not you can use mob extra or any which can give you terminal to get connected to this machine. Wherever the key value pair is right there right from there is where you have to get connected to the machines which you are creating. Now I have to get connected to these machines the three machines and I have to do some basic configurations. You also please follow as it is. I'll right click here and I would like to go with the show more option and I would like to open g bash here. Okay, the terminal is open and uh I would like to keep it blue only which will act like a control node. The first thing which you have to do is to go here and add the permission. Let me go here and give this permission. It's a way to get connected. That's all. I'll right click and paste it. Done. And after which I may have to just establish the connection. Let me open this. Copy this SSH. You should be knowing it if you know the Linux, if you know the fundamentals of AWS. If not, you can just follow as it is. But at least I'll keep in mind that you know the basics of Linux commands and uh how to create an account in AWS and how to play with any of the cloud providers. So that should not be a matter of concern at least. Now I would like to say yes, I could able to establish the connection. Okay, this will act like my control node. Now two more machines I have to get connected. But before I get connected to that, I want to install certain things. I have to make few changes here in my control. I have to make changes in all the machines. But first, let me make the changes inside this machine. Right now I have got connected to an instance which I have named as control node where I have to install the anible from where I'm going to manage the other servers from where I'm going to manage the other machines. Fine. So three machines basically we have in all three machines we have to do this. I'm first getting connected to the uh control server where I have to do this changes. So let me just do this here. Now the first thing which we may have to do is to add the user and password for which I'll say here sudo. This is the Linux command. In order to add this I'll say here user add maybe the name I'll give it as anible. Okay that's the name I have given here. And after which I would like to say here sudo and password for the anible I would like to add here anible. Okay s p sudo password anible. Let me hit the enter key here. And it is asking me to give the password. Make sure you give a password which you can recall. Other ways al also there uh going forward in the configuration. I will guide you by chance. If you forget this password what is that you may have to do. But however uh recall I would like to give a password which I can uh recall I'll say anything which I can recall okay retype the password and it is created all the authentication tokens are created after which I may have to configure the sudas file for which I would like to write one command here called as um sudo vi sudo. Okay, I'm just trying to know configure this sudas file and here I have to just scroll down and I may have to make sure that I'm enabling this. Let me just scroll down. Scroll down and you can see guys allow root to run any commands from anywhere. We have this right. At the same point, we may also have to add this. So, let me just add here one command for the anible also. I have copied this and uh you can also follow the same. You'll be getting this from the screen and you can just type it. No issues. Okay. I would like to just right click and add this. I have added. This is what you may have to add. After which control + x y you'll be out of this and uh you are out. Now again if I just cross check whether that has been uh you know added or not. You can just check once again and if you have to just uh scroll down you'll be in the position to see what changes we have already done it. Okay. We can see here we had done some changes with respect to anible root user it is already there for the anible you may have to just allow that's all this configuration okay I have done here then control + x y I have done it all right now we had already made the changes I was just cross-eing the changes have been made this is the step number two and the next part is to update or you can say configure the sd file that is what we may have to do where we may have to play around or configure or do some updation with respect to the password authentication for which I have to open this file. I'll say here sudo by default this file will be there open this in the visual editor what to open inside this directory there is one file called as sh hd config file that is what I may have to do it config file my bad I was making one mistake we shouldn't have not told here sd we have to say ssh okay this is the configuration file we may have to open now I would like to just hit the enter key you'll be able to open this you have to go to the insert mode I would like to press I here to get into the insert mode. And if you just uh scroll down here, you'll have something called as password authentication no and permit empty password no. Please make it yes. Both of that you have to make it yes option number one. If not, if you are thinking that you might have forgotten the password which you have used, you can just comment this out. Either you have to comment this uh first line option number one. If you no want to comment this, if you could able to recall the password, then you may have to go here and just say yes. Okay, these changes you may have to make. If not, the second part anyway you have to say yes and you can just comment this first line password authentication. That way also you can go. If not, you can just change it to yes. I would like to just uh you know save this file. Okay, escape colon wave in order to uh save this. It is saved now. The changes have been made. After which you may have to restart this server. For which I would like to say here sudo and uh service sd restart. I'll say here restart. s p s p s p s p s p s p s p s p s p s p sseudo service s S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S H H H H H H H H H H H H H H H H H H H H HD restart. Here is where I would like to click and it will be restarted. Now whatever steps we have done in this uh control node, same we may have to do in the other two machines which will act like a manage nodes here. That is the next step which we may have to follow. Now I would like to just uh go back to these machines. Let me go to the instances. We have done these changes here in the control node. I may have to repeat the same for the manage node number one and manage node number two also. Okay, which is going to get managed by the anible. Okay, I would like to copy this and um let me open one more terminal here on the same where I have this pam file and the git bash I would like to open just to make the changes or just to convey that uh this is a different you can just give a different colors or whatever okay so again I would like to just add this here I'm giving the permissions okay and now I may have to get connected this time we are getting connected to the other machine a normal uh server okay which will act like the manage node okay I have got corrected the same steps what we have done there we may have to do here as well first we may have to add the user I will say sudo okay user add I'll say user add anible user add okay I'll say here user add anible right and after which I'll say sudo I would like to say password I'll say anible we have added that and I would like to give the same password so that I should not be forgetting I'll say here um okay one more time whatever password you could able to recall okay I have given tokens is successfully updated now the other two steps which we have done earlier in the control node same we may have to do here first we may have to configure the sudas file okay so for which I'll say here sudo sudo sudo So we may have to open this particular file and uh here we have to make the changes. What is the changes we have to make? The same which we have done earlier. Okay. So I would like to just uh scroll down and uh where is that changes we may have to make? Let me just uh okay here is where in place of this we may have to add for anible user to allow root to run any commands anywhere. I want the anible to run any commands anywhere. Right click. I would like to add this. All right. And now I'll say here controlxy to come out of this. I have come out of this. Now I'm have to configure the sshd. Same command which we have used earlier. I would like to say here sudo v i e t c. I would like to say s h. I would like to say s hd and h d. I would like to say here config. This file will already be there in any machine. We just have to make some changes here. Okay, let me go to the insert mode again and we have done this earlier. Same we may have to do for other two machines. I would like to just go here and say yes to both. If not, you can comment the first line. That also would work. Okay. Now I would like to just go back and say yes. All right. Let me press escape. Come out of this file. W and q col w to come out of this. And now we may have to just restart this. I'll say here sudo service sd restart restart. Okay. And now it will be restarted. This step we have done for two machines control node and manage node. You may have to do it for one more manage node. The same steps you may have to follow. I hope you'll be able to do it by your own. Okay. I'll skip that part in this recording. If not it will be a lengthy one. Please do that in one more manage node. After this the remaining step we may have to do in our control node a machine where we are going to actually install this uh you know uh anible software. This is one of the manage node that is going to get managed by the anible right. So one more manage node same steps I would like to add and then we shall go to the second step of configuration where we have to install the Python the anible the required things in our control node and then we will try to connect our control node to our manage node as we have discussed in this architecture. Okay. So please do the same step in one more manage nodes and then we shall continue with the second round of configuration and installation. Now the first step towards the anible configuration is done. We have created uh three nodes and we have done the basic required configuration. Now the next step is to get connected to this control server. The control node and install the anible. Right? So these two systems are the one which are going to get managed by anible and this is the system from where we manage the other systems if in order to install anything right. So this is our control node. I hope you have was the architect of Anible. Now I would like to get connected to this machine. Okay. And let me just uh copy this and open this terminal and I would like to just get connected. Okay. And let me just go here and get connected to this particular machine. Okay. I have just hit the enter key. Let me clear this. Now inside this machine I want to install the anible. The first step would be to switch to the ansible user the user which we have already created. So let me write the command here. The command has been written. Now I would like to just say here cd get into this particular directory. Okay. Now I have gone right now after which I would like to say here sudo yum. First we may have to install and python as well as the python package manager. And using the Python package manager, we may have to install the Ansible. There's the approach we may have to follow. I'll say here sudo yum install install. I'll say here python 3. And just in case if package manager has to update something, I would like to just add hyphen y. Even if you don't add hyphen y, it's fine just to update the package manager yum which we are using here. Okay, we shall be installing the python here. It will take a few seconds to a minute of time and the Python will be installed. As you can see the Python is installed. Now I would like to just check the version. I'd say here Python 3 and - version. And if we are able to get the version that says Python is successfully installed here. Now I may have to install the Python package manager which is pip. Okay. So now for which I would like to say here sudo yum y which is optional step. I'll say here install install what to install I'll say here python 3 and pip a package manager which is required to install the anible I would like to hit this and it will take some time and the pip package manager is installed successfully. Now using this pip I may have to install the anible for which I may have to write one command here which is pip3. I would like to say here installed anible - user. Okay, I would like to hit this enter key and it will take some time and the anible should be installed in my control node. a node from where we are going to manage the other machines other servers right so it is taking some time and the anible will be installed now you can see the anible is successfully installed we can just check it I'll say here anible - version is the command which I'm executing here and we could able to get that here okay the moment I execute this uh command here after we install you can see anible 2.1.5.1 13 that means the anible is successfully installed. After which I would like to create one folder here. First of all let me just clear this screen so much of content here. I would like to now create one folder here. I'll say here mkdir and I want to create the folder. So let me just take the privileges first. Sudo create one directory. where you want to create a directory inside this etc folder which is already there by default in any Linux machine inside this please create one directory called as anible okay and this is done the next step is to generate the ssh key in my control node and copy that key into the manage nodes that will be our last step once we have done this the entire setup will be ready and then we can demonstrate uh how we can manage all other servers from our control node. That is what we may have to see. The last step is pending wherein we just have to generate one key here and copy that key into all the manage nodes. Let's do that. Now comes the last step as we have discussed. We have to generate the SSH key in our control node and copy that into our manage node. First I would like to make a switch to the anible user. I'll write one command here. I'll say sudo make a switch to anible user which we have created. It has switch here. And now I would like to say here SSH key generation generate the SSH key. That's the meaning of it. I would like to hit this enter key. Now generating the key. It is asking me to enter the file name. I would like to keep it default. I'll not enter anything here. That will be default. Okay. The key has been generated. Now this key I may have to copy into our manage node. So right now in our architect the way for which we are configuration we will have two manage nodes. two machines will be managed by Ansible, right? It could be any number of machines also. Fine. So now I would like to just go back here to my AWS account. I'll go to my instances and I'll go to my first manage node and get the private IP"

My name is Ain Reddi and let's talk about fast API. So when you work with Python, you can do multiple things with Python. You can use Python to build consolebased application. You can use it for GUI building. You can use it for web framework. You can use it for AI and of course for different things. We got different libraries, different frameworks. But now we are talking about fast API which is a web framework for Python. And this is not the first option. We have multiple frameworks available for Python. We got Django, Flask and now we got fast API. In fact, we already have a Django series which was created 5 to 6 years ago and now I should have gone for Flask and then fast API. In fact, fast API was never in the option. I wanted to explore flask but then I looked at fast API and thought I thought hey that's simple uh easy to go with and it works. And the most important thing is it has this amazing features which we're going to talk about now. So let's head towards the homepage of fast API. Now before we talk about fast API, I want to show you the project which we're going to build to start with. Okay. And maybe later on we'll update this project mode. We'll add more features based on what fast API has to offer. Okay. Now this is a simple page because I wanted to explore C operation and this is what we are going to build. Now hold on. Using Python and using fast API we can build the back end and you are looking at the front end. Now the front end is actually in react and no we are not going to learn react in this course. This imagine this page or this front end is already created. Now to make it work you have to build a backend for it. Okay example if you talk about this things whatever you are doing here this data is coming from the back end. So the database which we're going to use is posgress but you can use whatever you want. The back end we are going to use Python and the framework is fast API and the front end is in react. So we are going to skip the React part. You will get the code as it is the entire React application. You just have to build a back end and run it will work. I mean it should work uh based on your configuration. Now what we're trying to build here is this is a simple inventory application. Nothing very fancy and I don't want to launch my own startup for this uh simple application. Right now in this we got a products here and which in which you can see we got list of products and then uh I have an option of sorting this of course this is of react part nothing to do with the back end but what is there in the back end this data is coming from the back end and you can edit this data you can see if you click on edit it is changing here again the part of front end but the actual saving or updating of data is happening in the back end uh I can add a new product here I can just simply say refresh okay now this is something this is the first time I'm looking at this bug not a bug but then how will you go to add now okay I should have done that before okay so refresh the page there's something I need to update in the front end as well anyway the point is let's say if you if you got this front end I want to add the ID which is let's say five and I want to say let's say asus laptop description budget laptop price is let's say 999 uh and then quantity is let's say we got 12 quantity and add and you can see it has got added which is which is here now This is the entire front end. You can search for the product. Example, if you say a laptop, it will show you the laptops, right? Again, this is a front- end functionality of searching. But then uh when you search something, okay, this is filtering. We should not be using that. Maybe I should be doing that with the help of ID. So if I say three, you can say there's three. So this is basically can be done through the back end as well. Uh what else you can do? You can delete the items. So this is the back end feature. So if I click on delete pen because I don't want cheap products in the inventory. I'm just kidding. Pen is very important. Uh and you can see it is got it got deleted. Okay, simple stuff. Now I want to show you the back end for this. And this is the entire code repository which I'm going to share with you. So there's a front end folder which you can see here and the back end is this files. Uh not the perfectly optimized code for the production but we are not doing for the production now. We are basically learning a framework right. So this should make sense. And now let's head towards the homepage of fast API. And this is it. This is fast API and they are claiming it's a fast API framework. It's high performance, easy to learn, fast to code and ready for production. Uh out of this I have tested for easy to learn, fast to code and ready for production. I have not tested for the high performance. But if they are claiming it and a lot of people are using it, so it should be okay. Now if you want to read documentation, you can read it from here and that's the homepage. You can just look at for the documentations here. and fast API is modern fast performance. Again, I have not tested it, but it's very easy to work with and you will see that when when we do that. Okay, so very very high performance on par with NodeJS and go. Okay, that's what they are promising. Uh faster code we have seen this few bugs and okay other thing looks good. Now this is what fast API is promising. So fast API is basically a web framework and we are going to do this step by step. So the first thing we need to do is in fact there are some prerequisites. Uh you need to know Python. Of course we are not going to teach you Python in this course. So you should know Python. You need to basically understand how basically a web framework works. And in in fact I'm going to give you a glimpse uh what happens when you communicate from a client side or whenever you access a particular website how it works. But having that knowledge prior to it will be helpful. But don't worry I will talk about it as well. And uh that's it. You don't you need just two things. uh in terms of softwares to do this you need to have Python installed in your machine and a editor now or ID to be specific. Now you can use uh IDE like PyCharm for Python or you can use VS code or any other ID which you like. We are going to use VS code here because for PyCharm uh it will be bulky and not everyone will be having it and people are getting used to VS code. So let's use VS code in this course and maybe in between I will show you how do we run this in PyCharm. Okay, let's that's a separate thing but initially we'll start with VS code and there are certain things which we have to install and stuff. Yeah, initially there will be learning curve but once you get used to it it's very easy. Okay, cool. So that's about the introduction for fast API. Apart from this uh make sure whenever you watch the upcoming videos don't just watch the videos practice them because practicing is very important otherwise it's of no use. and uh go through the documentation you know in case if I miss something just go through the documentation and you'll be good in fact I wanted to add one disclaimer the UI which you are seeing here is it's created by AI okay so if you find any glitch here you can blame the AI if you love it I did it I I did those prompts with the AI so before we start coding with fast API let's do the most important step without which you can't continue and that is the setup of course set in your machine you need to have those things so Let's go step by step. The first thing you have to check is open your terminal. Now based on which OS you're using and I mean we call terminal everywhere now. So cmd terminal whatever you prefer open that and check do you have python installed. So how do you check? It's very simple. You say python - version and if you see a version there that means python is there. Now I have tested with two different versions 3.12 and 3.13 it works. If you have a previous version, I would recommend you to upgrade. Otherwise, if you have a low version, try it out. If something is not working, just upgrade. Okay, that's one. Next, if you want to use the front end, see whatever front end we saw in the previous video, it's not compulsion that you can run that application with that front end. It's optional. We have another way of accessing those pages. We can use Postman like your rest client. Uh we can also use insomnia. You can use swagger. And by default, fast API gives you docs in the format of swagger. So you can use that but front end looks good. You will get that satisfaction. Yeah, you have done something. That's the only reason we have that front end. But in case if you want to run front end, uh you need to make sure that you have NodeJS installed and I have tested with version 22. Make sure that you have upper version than this. Uh I have not updated my node from a long time. In case if you don't have these two softwares and I'm assuming you have Python because this is the advanced part of Python. So you should you need to have that. I will not show you Python. Let's get towards NodeJS and this is this is where you can click on download and there should be option of this. This is the latest version you can go with LTS version. You can also go with the current version and that should work. Now once you have uh these two let's see what else we need. So you need these two. Done. Verified. Next. Now you need an ID. So in my machine I got VS code and I already have VS code open in one of the screen. Let me just drag it here. This is how it will look like. I will just increase the font size. And this is where we'll be doing all the work. So make sure that you have Python, you got NodeJS. Again, NodeJS optional if you don't want to use the UI. Uh then you need VS Code or PyCharm or whatever ID you prefer. Uh next in your VS code you need to have Python extension installed and again I'm assuming that you have worked on Python before it's just that if you have not worked on Python on VS code uh you need to make sure that you have this extension. So micro Python from Microsoft okay next before we do any more configuration in VS code now this section or this small part is only for those people who want to run the UI. Now in that case instead of taking a lot of trouble what you can do is in fact I would recommend you to do do this. So on GitHub you have this particular folder called front end in the project. Okay. So this is our project and in this we got multiple branches. If you can see we got product with UI, product with DB, product put, delete and post. So this is our first repository which we're going to start with. Again I'm going to type everything except the front end part. But if you jump to the last branch with products with UI, this is what you need to download. Okay. Uh, of course you will get everything. But this is where this is important for us. Now, how do you download? It's very simple. You can simply click here and click on download. Now, why I would I'm recommending download instead of this uh cloning is when you clone you will get the entire project. Okay? And when you open, you will get again you will get all these files. When you download what will happen is you will get everything a zip file. Unzip it and then delete the extra folders or the extra files here. You are only concerned about front end. Okay? Just keep it there. Again, when you clone it, you can also delete all the other files. But it is easier to download from the file explorer or the whatever you call these days now. What it is called? Yeah, file explorer. So you can delete from there. So download it, unzip it and get this folder. This folder is important if you want to run the UI and I'm going to do the same thing. So I'm just going to download this and I should have shown the steps you know simple. So open unzip done. This is where you got your folder. Uh open this. You got only one branch which is fast API demo products with UI and out of this you need just this one folder. Apart from this you don't need any any of the things. You can just simply copy this and let's create a folder for us. I will do that in the C drive and let me make a new folder and I will say fast API demo recording because I'm I'm using it for recording. So I will use that because after some time after a few weeks I will look at this project and I I will not realize why I have created this project. So let me just create that folder in the C drive and put your front end there. Simple stuff. U now once you have these steps ready what you can do is go to your VS code and open the folder. So C drive fast API - demo- recording and open this folder not the front end open the fast API demo recording folder and yeah you got it just say trust and you are in now once you got this project this is where your front end is and you can run the front end as it is uh in fact I should be showing that now as well so let me do that so I will just go back here go to your terminal and in the terminal move to front end. So, make sure that you're in the front end folder. And if you have never worked on React before, this is a React project. Let me show you some certain things. So, this is the main package.json. This this is where you handle the dependencies. You write the script, when to run, when not to run, how to stop, how to debug and all the stuff. Now, to run this basically, you can simply say npm install. Now, we're not running it. We are installing the dependencies. So whatever dependencies needed for this project because see if you open this package of JSON one of the dependency is React itself. So React is a library. So you have to get that. Now once you get this uh dependencies you have to say npm installed so that it will download all the dependencies. And how do you know if you have dependencies downloaded or not? In the front end folder you will you will see one more folder called nodes modules. And you can you can only see that when you have your dependencies downloaded. So we we can't see that now when once I click on npm install it will download the dependencies for you and you can see it is doing it fast and this is the folder I'm talking about and as you can see we got this uh downloaded and those things are in this node modules and now it's time to run the node or the react project. So I will say npm start. Now how do you know it is start? If you come down there's a script called start. This is where you have to enter and this will start the project. Okay, it says something is already running because I think my older project is still running. I will just close it now. No, I don't want to use another port. Let's do that again. And now it should start. Okay, so it is opening now. And this is your project. Now it says fail to fetch is because the back end is not working. Uh that pop-up came and went because I've set the timer for 5 seconds. But no products and nothing will work. Okay, even if you add products, it will not work because the back end is not connected. In fact, you you can also check because this is what you're going to do later. Uh you can go to console and you can see it will say something is blocked or the server okay server is not server is still running on the other project. My bad. Now let's try refresh. Yeah, this is what I was expecting. I was not expecting cause error. So it says error connecting or connection refused. There's nothing on the back end. Cool. So let's make this work. But what other setup we need? So let's go back here and close this. This is the front end part. The next thing we need in this particular setup is the fast API itself. So what you will do is you'll open a new terminal here and let's install the fast API. In fact, we need two things. One, the fast API itself because that's a framework we're going to use. The second thing we need here is a web server because we are building a web application. REST API is also a web application. And this web application runs on a server. You need to you need to get that. So if you have worked on Java before, if you want to have a web server there, we got Tomcat. For Node, for React or NodeJS, we got Node itself. Uh for PHP, we got ZAM server. So for every particular language, we got some servers. Here we have to get the web server which is called UION. I know unique name instead of unicorn that went for uon. Good. Um so what I will do is I will get the uicon but before that I will in in fact whenever you want to install some packages we use something called pip right but we have a problem here if I install let's say if I install fast API here so I will say pip install uh fast API is that simple just write a command it will install the problem is this will install fast API for all my Python projects so maybe I'm working on AI as in some other project or maybe I'm working on uh consolebased application in some project. The moment I say pip install fast API, it will install fast API globally for all the projects. We don't want it. We want fast API only for this project. Now how do you isolate? So basically in different uh languages they have different ways of doing it. In Python normally what you do is if you want to have some packages specific to one project you create something called a environment your own environment or maybe we can call it as a virtual environment. So here we want to create a virtual environment. So how do we do it? It's very simple. You say python - m and then you specify what you want to create. I want to create a virtual environment. So v env that's what it's called virtual environment. And you have to give a name to it. You can give any name. Maybe you can say fast api project if you want. Uh I will simply say my environment because I want to keep it unique. Uh so my environment. Okay. Now the moment you do that it will create an environment which will take some time. Okay. So you can see it is still not doing anything because things are happening behind the scene and this is what you got. You need to get this folder. If you don't have this folder something is wrong with the command or the the command here. And in this you got all your environment set up ready. And by default you will get these two but we want more. So what we you will do is you will say pip. Okay. Now you have to activate it first. Now how do we activate? So to activate based on what you're using. If you're using PowerShell or a command prompt, you need to use different script. So this is these are the scripts. For PowerShell, this is a script. For command prompt, this is a script. So for PowerShell, just copy the path. I hope this will work. Just going for the absolute path. Let me try. Yeah, it worked. So instead of typing, normally you just have to type this much. But absolute path works. Then why to worry? In fact, you should be copying the relative path. Yeah, this is what I was expecting. But no problem. We are able to run this script and that's important. Now, how do you know it is successful? It has created the environment. If you see before your path, you should be getting this your environment name. So, your uh environment is activated. Now, how do you deactivate? It's very simple. You simply say deactivate with the right spelling. And now you're out. So, this is how you do it. So, if you want to get in, activate. If you want to go out, deactivate. Now let me show you what's the difference of I mean what how it helps. So if I say pip list it will show all the packages installed this in this machine and if you scroll down this it's a huge list for different project we got different libraries I just keep adding them and now okay if I activate again and now let's check you should be able to see only one right but then I want two more so the what are two more so you have to say pip install you need to get fast API and we need one more which is web server which Ubicon. So you will say not unicorn Ubicon and done. When you say run this code, I mean run this command not code, it will download those things for you which will take some time and yeah so you can see we got all the packages here. So we have dependencies dependencies right? So there are some dependencies where which dependencies are dependent on uh so it will get that as well. In fact if you want to check you can do that uh pay list and it will give you everything now. So you got fast API, you got ubicon and we are happy. That's the setup you need and I'm tired doing the setup here. So these two things and fast API ubicon you need. Then you can start with the code. Now it's time to start coding. But again we will not be writing a lot of code in this particular video because we have to also understand some theory part before we go ahead. But we'll start with coding and then we'll get into theory. So what I'm going to do is we got these two things here that perfectly works. Let me create a Python file and let's name this as main. py. So what exactly I'm trying to do here? So let's say whenever a user visits the website of of course we are not buying any domain here but we'll run this project in the local. Okay. And the way you can access that is by saying localhost colon. So instead of 3,000 let's go for 8,000. What are these things here? Now if you are new to web development this local host see whenever you talk about any website or any web application you have to deploy it somewhere right so maybe you're deploying on some server maybe provided by Amazon so what you do is you deploy your application there and it is running on the server now if if you want to access it you have to use the IP address because every server will have their own IP address and since we don't want to remember the IP address instead of that we use domain names right so whenever you go put to your website like when you go to NodeJS this is their website domain if you go to fast this is a website domain in the same way if you want to access particular website you have to provide a domain name now since we don't have a domain I'm running on my own machine so I can use the IP address now since we want the IP address of the same machine I can use local host next in your machine you can run multiple services multiple server services and how how will you differentiate between these services and that's where we can use something called a port number. Example, when I was running a react, react was running on port number 30,000. The fast API will be running on uicon server and by default the port number will be 8,000. So when I say enter, it says the site cannot be reached. Why is because our server is not running. So what we can do is we can run the server. But before we run the server, we need to return something, right? So let's say the server is running and you want to show some output here. So when you go to this homepage it should return let's say welcome to the list track something like that. Now in order to achieve that what you can do is you can create a function because in Python when you want to achieve something you create a function but again it is giving you s some suggestions. I don't want to use the co-pilot suggestions. So I will just nose it for some time now and okay so let's create a function. So I will say defaf and the job of this particular function is to greet the user. So I can say greet. Okay, simple function and I'm going to print welcome to the list go track. Okay, simple stuff, nothing fancy. I want to print this. Okay, now there are two problems here and I will tell you those problems in some time. So I will just save this. Now question arise, how will you run this? Now of course you can write this is your Python file. You can simply say python main python space main. py and this will this should be able to print. It's just that we are uh running it but we are not calling it. Okay. So we have to call the grade function. Okay. So let's call this and run. And you can see it is printing on the console. But we don't want to print on the console, right? We want to print on the web page. Now in that case, I don't have to call it here. It should be called through the web page. So whenever I refresh this page or go to this homepage, it should call that particular function and it should return this welcome to the list track. So that means we we're not supposed to print it. We are supposed to return it to whoever is calling it. So printing is not an idea. Now we have to return this. Okay, that solves one problem. And once we save it, let's go back. Run. Uh, it will still not work. Reason the server is not running. Okay, even if you have the code, the server is not running. Now, how to run the server? Of course, you will not be using Python because Python is for the console based. This is where we have to use a web server. Now, one of the web server we have already installed is Ubicon if you remember. So, we can use ubicon here and we can run it. So, I can simply say Ubicon. Then we have to provide the file name and then we have to specify hyphen - reload. Okay. Now let me try to run this and let's see what you get. Okay. It says it is trying to will the changes in the directory because reload means the moment you say save it will just reload. Uh uicon running on server this. Okay. You can see the port the address here. Now 127.0.0 zero is your own machine and then 8,000 is a port number but here somewhere here it says error loading the ASGI app which is your web server import string main must be in a format okay so it needs a format if you can see this is the format it is expecting here so it's module and attribute so we are specifying the module here which is main this is your module because that's what you're creating here but something is missing some attribute is missing Uh okay let's go step by step. Now what is missing is we are using a web framework which is uh fast API and nowhere we have mentioned that we're using fast API. So we need to create the object of fast API and let's say the object name is app equal to and fast API we can simply use fast API here and create the object for fast API. But then this is not happy. It says uh fast API is not defined. Okay, why it's not defined is because it is defined. It's just that we have to import it. So I will say import fast API. Um no I have to import fast API but this will be coming from fast API library. Yeah. So from fast API import fast API. Okay. And then you can create the object. So this fast API is a library. This is your class. I hope we can see the documentation. Yes. So you can see this is a class. Cool. Uh and then we can create the object. And now since we have the object here when I run this now so I will just I can say Ctrl C to stop the server and come back to the main screen. And now when I run this I have to pass main colon app. So you have to also mention the object name. Cool. Now it should work. Enter the server is running. Congratulations. We can have a round of applause. Something is working after a very long time. And now it is running on the server. That's cool. So when I go to this particular page, in fact the same page we are doing here. And now if I hit this again, oh okay, we got some output. Server is running but it says not found. Okay. So there were two problems before. First the server was not running. Second we were not getting whatever we want to print. Uh but at least one problem is solved. The server is running but we're not able to print. So let's solve that. And before we understand that, let's move towards something called REST API. See, before we go move into REST API, we got a client and we got a server. Now, what's the job of a server is to give services, right? Now, this can be a file server, this can be a web server, this can be some other server. Now, when you say it's a file server, the job here is to give files to whoever who is asking for this file. So, let's say if there's a client A and says, hey, I want that file, it will go to the request goes to the server. File server says, okay, let me search for the file and yeah, I got the file. This is your file. That's how the file server works. And it uses its own protocol to do that. There's something called FTP or SFTP if you want to secure it. Uh on the other hand, for the web server, what's the job of a web server? To give the data to the user. Now, normally this data can be in the format of HTML or it can be format of JSON. Now, why HTML is because in the real world, we all use web pages, right? So when you go to Google, when you go to any website like Amazon, you when you go there, you see the Amazon page, right? You see all the products. Now you are able to see that beautiful pages because of the HTML and CSS and JavaScript. Now all these things coming to the client side from the server. So when a client says hey give me Amazon.com the Amazon.com says okay these are the files take it and view on the browser. So that works right. But the problem is when you create this type of application because see one application needs multiple things. There are multiple layers here. User normally uses front end but the data is stored in the database. So we got the front end and we got database. So there are two apart two things apart. Now user is concerned about the data. So of course user wants a data that is coming from the database. So don't you think the front end should be able to interact with the back end directly or with the database directly? Uh we can't do that. First of all there are multiple issues. one is is not secure directly accessing the database. Second uh you will get data in normal text we want something good and the third problem is to access the database we have to use SQL if it is if it is a relational database and that's why what you do is in fact there are fourth problem also sometime you don't want data directly what you want is processed data something you have worked on something you have applied filter on or maybe combining multiple things your calculations and some data in this case what you do is you add one component in between which is back end. So we got a front end, we got a datab database and now we have the back end in between. Now back end will be returned in any language. It can be Python, Java, JavaScript doesn't matter, right? So that's a back end which we build. So the request goes from the front end to the back end. Then back end does the processing of it and applying logic to it, fetching data from database if required and then sending the response to the client or the front end. Now this can be in two format. one from the back end side. You can create those beautiful pages and send it to the client side or you can send the front end without the data just the layout just the layout and then you can populate those data later example let's say if your internet is off and you are so let's say on your phone you don't have the internet you don't have your mobile connection as well but still when you open Instagram you can see the layout there right what is missing is the data you can't see the image you can't see the text but layout is there is because the layout is fixed. Now what is coming from the server is only the data. Now in which format you will get this data? The format is JSON. Way back we used to use XML but it is bulky and lot of issues. Now JSON is a perfect format where you can get the data in a structure format and it will be less bulky to understand and you will see some JSON data if you have not seen that before. So this is the communication. Now we started with rest and now it's time to talk about rest. Now when you send this data the data has to be in a proper format and that's where we got this term called rest which is representational state transfer. See whenever a client sends a request for the data you are sending the state. State means current data or current state of the data. So you're sending the state from the server side to the client side or vice versa. You're sending from data from client side to server side. So you're sending a state. Next you need to send the state in a representational format. it should be easy to represent and you are transferring it and that's why we got this term which is representational state transfer rest so in order for a client to reach to the server of course server simply not accept all the request uh what if you are building a website for the e-commerce and this and the client says hey I want to look for job here the server can't do that now because server says okay I was good with uh products but now you're asking for a job I can't do that so as a server it has to open some endpoints."

In fact, I've added some credits in the openi. I got the subscription for jad gpt and many more. In fact, jet brains AI assistance and I thought it will increase my productivity. And then when you build with AI, if you're using cursor or any other AI agents or IDE where you got AI agents inbuilt, you think that it is improving your speed and that's what I used to think and I was very happy building those projects. So I did some pilot projects I did some projects for the uh for the courses and in fact the internal projects which we are building in the disco we are using AI assistance and then we are thinking it's going very fast thanks to all this AI tool and then I was talking to my one of one of my friend and we were discussing about what Mark Zuckerberg mentioned about developers and their plan is to replace mid-level engineers with AI by by the end of 2025 in fact Salesforce CEO says they have a plan of replacing developers or workforce with AI. And then my friend sent me this article and this article is by meter. So they are basically a model evaluation and threat research. This is what they do and they basically evaluate the models AI system and see how well they are doing. And they published this article. What they did is they did this uh randomized control uh trial where they basically got few developers, few experienced developers who has experience of 10 years, 15 years and then everyone was working on their own opensource project and now they got this task of working on their projects maybe a particular task or series of tasks and few people got the AI help and few people were asked to do it by themsel and before doing this research in fact we have this amazing chart here which looks good. So basically uh the economics experts or whenever you see news they are predicting that using AI it doesn't matter maybe any field it in terms in development or in research or whatever whatever you are into uh it will speed up your process by around 40% that's what they are forecasting the experts in ML they said okay let let's go bit down and let's have a smaller range now the developers before this study they they thought okay it will speed up their process by around 25%. And after the study they thought they it has improved their performance by 20%. Okay. But the observed result is it has decreased their productivity by 19%. So this is for people who used AI to complete those task. So that means AI is actually reducing your speed of development. Okay. Now that is what this research talks about. Now of course they actually went in detail. Uh so the thing is there are certain things which we have to understand first these are experienced developers maybe they are not experienced with AI how to use prompts or how to uh do the same task in a efficient way I'm not sure or maybe they have but one thing is for sure they were working on their own projects and now what happens is when you work on your own project so let's say if I'm working on a particular project for 3 to four years now I know in and out of that project from start to end you just give me a a method a name I will tell you in which class you will find it or if you tell me okay there's a problem with this particular feature I will exactly know where the problem is maybe I don't know the solution but I know the pro where the problem will be now when you know this much about a project and if you given a task to do to work on it it will be faster is because for AI AI has a limited context here so it will read your code files because that's how AI agents work so when you have AI agent in your ID. Basically, you can give a task. Hey, you know, this is a project. Maybe I want to add this particular feature. Now, what this AI agent will do is it will scan the entire project files step by step. And then it will figure out, okay, these are the project files. This is what it does. And now I want to add this new feature. Now, at this point when a developer get this prompt, you have two options. You can ask it to, you know, don't ask me just modify the files and we don't do that in actual projects. So we do that when you are building a fun application or if you want to just try out some pilot projects it's it's good there but if you want to do that in the existing project which is already into prod we don't normally allow AI to make the changes we simply say okay give me suggestion I will do it now this suggestion given by AI first it will take time to generate the response then you have to analyze the response and then after analyzing it then you'll make some modification because rework is required sometime or most of the time and then you modify it and then you say okay now let's skip it there so it takes more time than building that thing by yourself and that's what this re research talks about now one more thing to observe they were slow I mean using AI it was slow is because they were using the older models so this research was done uh in July and maybe before that because it got published in July uh maybe June yeah it was July and they have used a tools which was released earlier this year but now so they have used 3.5 3.7 set or cloud cloud sonet but now we got claude opus 4.1 GPD5 which are way better than this models uh if you compare opus 4.1 it is better than 3.7 and if you compare GPD5 again that is compared that is better than this so maybe if they conduct the same research now the models or the result of using AI would be bit better but also if we can write a proper prompts if we can give a proper context to the AI or maybe we can if you can do fine tuning with it it will give a better result now coming back to my experience working with it uh so as I mentioned I have used it for pilot projects I have used it for creating course projects and the internal tools which we are using it worked because we have not done that in one day because if you are just testing it for one day it might not do well. We are using that continuously. So now the AI tool knows or maybe we have done some fine tuning with it or maybe we have added some more context it is performing well not just in terms of green field projects where everything is started from scratch also the project which we have already built. So 90% done already done now we have added some new features with the help of AI and that is working. It is also useful in creating test cases. It is also useful in creating documentations. So overall the productivity is going up. So yes it slows you down when you just started work for one day but overall it improves it. It will improve your speed but that doesn't means that it will replace developers completely because even AI is not that powerful. Yes they are claiming it. Uh maybe AI is a bubble. We are not sure. Uh everyone talks about AI is a bubble. See AI as a technology is not a bubble. Same goes for blockchain. Blockchain as a technology was not a bubble. Uh it was the funding which was happening to the blockchain companies which was a bubble. The blockchain technology is solid and same goes for AI. AI as a technology is very solid. What is a bubble is this fundings which is going on. So just you know one of my developers were talking you know we are losing this battle you know we should raise funds just launch any AI product we will get funds. We can do that but we don't want to shut down the company after two to three months. So not a good idea because it might be a bubble right uh so that's that's the thing AI is solid and it will improve the speed and maybe in future we will get better AI models and of course the the way we are thinking that AI models will grow exponentially it's not happening uh with every model you will see slight imp improvement we wanted huge improvements but that is not happening uh so I will put this research link in the description And if you find something which I have not talked about uh let me know in the comments. In fact I want to add one more point here. There's also articles regarding 95% of the AI pilot projects are are failing. See the thing is when you talk about pilot projects they are mostly for testing and initial things. But if you think about software development as well not every project which starts actually goes to production. Right? There are so many softwares which we build, we test it out and we realize okay that's not how it's working. Then we pivot and then we build something else. Okay. So even when software development came for the first time it most of the projects were failing. But soon we realize okay we have to follow some system design we have to follow some uh best practices we have to follow some pipelines and using that you can build a better project. Now same goes for AI it's very new so it will take some time to grow and once it is there once we have the best practices we have the tools of course it will not be 90% but somewhere around 50 60 and that is enough uh cool so that's about this where AI is slowing down maybe but not exactly bye-bye Right."

So back end is running and we are testing that using swagger and things are working fine. But now it's time to connect this front end. Now the front end is running here. So if I even if I refresh uh it has some issues. But what I will do is because we have we have we ran the front end way back in the first video uh of second video. What I will do is I will just rerun the front end to show you the steps again. Let's do step by step. Right? That would that should make much more sense. Okay, the first thing you have to do is open a new terminal here. You can just click here and open the new terminal. Uh maybe I will do that again. So I will just click here. It is opening a new terminal. And the only thing it is doing it is going into environment. I will I don't want to get into the environment. I will say deactivate coming out of the environment. And then you have to move to the folder called front end. and make sure you have front end here because we have done that in the first video or second video. Okay. Now once you have a front end you need to install the dependencies. So just to give you a glimpse of this front- end folder uh this is a react application in which uh basically you have this package.json react is a library that's why we are adding that in a dependency and then if you want to run the scripts to run this server you have to say npm start. So those are the things we have to remember and we have also done the proxy for localhost col 8000 because when you send the request here behind the scene this will work with this particular URL. So we have those things there. Next you have to make sure that whatever dependencies you have mentioned here are the part of node modules. If you are doing this for the first time you will not be having node modules. So I will just say npm install. It will download the dependencies and keep it in the node modules. Now once you have done that you can simply say npm start. This will start your front end and as you can see it started the front end. This is your front end. Now there are certain issues. The back end is still running. There's nothing wrong with the back end but the front end is not working. If you can see it says failed to fetch the products and you don't have any products. Let's see what is going wrong there. So I will right click here and click on inspect. Let's go to console. And if I zoom the console a bit, it says there is a problem with uh the cause. Okay, that's one problem. There are more problems which we are going to talk about now. And to understand those problems, let's go back to the project. Now in the React project, if you go to src. Now this app.js, this is where you are doing all the routings. Okay, request sending response, I mean accepting the response. So it is sending a request to this particular base URL. Okay. And that's what we have for the back end. So if you look at the back end, that's your URL. Apart from it the each request URL changes, right? So when you send a request for fetching all the products, let's say fetch products, you got this URL called / products. And if you try to match that with the main, let's try to match it now one by one. So get all products the same URL. So no problem. Now when you try to go for the next one which is this creating or updating a project in this case you are sending a request for the products. Okay so are we using products for update? No we are using products. So make sure everywhere you say products just for the simplicity I I went for product before but let's make it products everywhere. Even in put we have products just to show you if you in fact yeah put will be using the same thing. But what about delete? So if you scroll down for delete down yeah even delete is using products. So I will say products. So everywhere you have to make sure that you have products. Okay that's one of the problem. The second problem we have is which we saw in the console is this cause error. Now cause stands for cross origin resource sharing. So if I zoom it a bit. Now by default when you have two servers example if you are deploying uh two applications on the same server with the same port or maybe of the same server they are okay to work with okay because every time you request for something they know it's coming from the same server it is safe but what if the request is coming from some other server now in that case there might be hacking issues now how do you solve it and that's where you have to give the permission so by default course will always be blocked and you have to give the permission. So how will you give the permission? So you have to go to the main file again and this is where for the fast API this app you have to give the permission to accept from particular client. So by default it will accept from the same file or same port number because if you remember this swag was running on the same port number. So there was no issue but your front end is running on port number 3000. That's where the issue is. So how will you give the permission? So you have to say app dot add middleware in which you have to pass in parameters and multiple parameters. So I will just say enter. So first thing you have to mention which middleware you're working with. So I'm working with course middleware and I think we have to import that. So course middle where will be coming from fast? So from fast API dot middleware dot cause from this we have to import post middleware. Now once you got course middleware what are the extra parameter you have to add the next thing you have to add is the allow origin so from where you want to allow it and you can pass the list of values not just one and I just want to specify one value at this point so it'sp col// localhost col 3000 this is this is from this is where you have to allow it do we have to mention more properties let's try let's try with this and let's see if something goes wrong uh the server got reloaded no problem with that front end we don't have to change anything. Let's try with this. And if this works, then we don't have to worry. Refresh. Yeah, it worked. So, we don't have to worry about the other parameters. And voila, you can see we got products here. Okay. So, this is working. Let me just try to add a new product and let's see if that works. Uh let's say not minus one, two. Name I will add laptop description best gaming laptop. Price is 1599 and quantities. Let's say we got only five quantity. Okay, let's see if this works. Add operation failed. Let's see what happened. It says bad request for the products. So, we have changed it to products. Let's see. Let's go back to the inspect console. Okay. So, for the homepage, there's no issue. I think it's issue with the methods. So, let's add a few more parameters. I'm just guessing that's the issue. So we'll say allow methods because we are changing something. So I will just add all the methods here. So star means all the all the methods. And now let's try click on add. Okay. So basically what we have done is when you say allow origin the homepage was working because you are reading things when you say submit you are changing something to the server and by default even submit does not work. So you have to say allow that as well. So when I say when you say start it will accept all the methods. So that works. Let's refresh. No problem there. And if you go back here we got this laptop. Let me try to edit uh let's say pen. So we got details of pen here. You can't change the ID. That's a good thing. And let me change the price to 149. And let me change the description to blue and black pen. You know sometime you have this combination of pens where you have single pen where you can change the buttons. Uh, I used to love those pens in my childhood. So, submit and it says method not allowed. Okay, something went wrong there. Let me check the console. Okay, so 40 methods not allowed. Which method is executing? Let me check for update. We do have Okay. No, here it is products. Let me check here. What is the issue? Put that's correct. We got products here. Got products edit ID. Is this the variable which is creating the issue? Uh edit ID from where it is getting the edit ID. So when you send this request, this is working. Uh blue pen. Okay. I think we have made one mistake here. When I was changing products, I have also removed this part. My bad. remember the dynamic data because the ID is getting from here, right? I don't know how I messed that part. Let's go back here. Click on submit again and it worked. So, it says product updated successfully. But, uh, how do I verify? So, yeah. So, it's blue and black pen. Perfect. So, edit done. And let me try edit one more time. Let's edit this smartphone. A slim smartphone. Price let's say just $699 and let's say 51. Update product updated successfully. Okay, it works. It works. Perfect. Now we can also try deleting. So we can delete this part the pen and pen gone. Okay. And all the searching part was from the UI side. Cool. So that's how you basically connect your front end and back end things are working out. Yes, there are sever there were some issues but my mistake. Okay. So when I was I don't know why how I deleted this part while I typing the S there. Happens. Happens. So that's about this particular project which we have built not the front end just the back end and we are able to connect the front end uh that's a success I think. So that's it."

In fact, we also left with uh post. So we'll start with post first and then we'll move towards other methods. Now you help me what to do here. So first of all, we need to get this DB session. So I can just copy it from here. I mean when I say help uh just think about it and I will I will know your thinking and I will get the answers from you. So here I will just paste it so that I will get the DB. Now once I get the DB here I can use it to add the product. So I will not be using append I will be using add. But the question arise how will I add it? Now if you remember when we worked with in DB this is where we were adding data in the database right. So you can just copy this and paste it here and let's see do we have to make any changes. Not here not here. So basically we got the product here and that's the product I wanted to add but here it's basically Pythonic model I want to convert that into a database model and that's the thing we are doing here using model dump and uh unpacking and it will add cool so simple right uh we can verify this and to verify this I will go back to the browser refresh this and first of all let me just try to get all the products to see how many products we have here. So execute. We got four products. 1 2 5 and six. Let's add a new product. And I will be using one of it to make the changes or to create a new product. And for creating I have to go here and click on try it out. Replace with this or maybe I will just add it here. So we got five and six. Let me add seven here. We can also make this autogenerated. So instead of typing the ID seven, maybe you can just pick up the last ID and use it. I mean plus one and and use it. Uh name I will say book that's what I wanted to enter here and I will say my daily notes and the price is let's say we got $10 and quantity is let's say we got 100 of quantity of this and click on execute. This should add the product and there's no problem. Response body is this uh status code is 200. So that's important. 200 means everything is okay. Let me verify this by going to database. this I mean you can verify from the products as well but let me go to database and run and okay oh oh something is not working you know what is why things went wrong uh it's because we are actually adding it it's just that we forgot one step commit okay so whenever you make changes you have to say commit otherwise it will not commit so it's a db dot commit and now let's reload code. Go back there and execute the same thing again 200 and we can verify from database. Run. Yep, we got it. So, we got a new entry which is book my daily nodes and uh price and quantity. We can also verify this from the get all products. I can just execute this part and this should print my daily notes as well. Perfect. Right. Okay. Cool. Uh, so we have done with the get, we have done with the post. Let me just go with the put. Now we can make it quick. Now we know a lot of things. So when you want to update a product because update is taking two things, the ID and the product which is new information and you want to update the details. Now see creating it is very easy. You can simply use add because it will create a new record. Updating means you have to fetch the existing record. First of all you have to check do you have existing record of the same ID. If you have then you have to pick up the values from this product and add it there multiple steps. So what I can do here is uh first of all I don't need all these things. In fact let me remove all these things and let's make it from scratch. So the first thing I want to do is I want to check if the product exist and you can use this thing to check if the product product exist. So I can just copy this and paste it here because this will give you the product but also I need to uh use this thing. Sometime it's important to re uh reuse the code. So once you got the DB object here I can use it here. No problem. And once you got this you can check if DB product if this exist I want to do certain things. If not I can write this in the else part here. else return no product. Okay, but in the if block I want to write certain things. What are the things I want to write? Uh first of all we know if it exe it it is coming to if block that means the product exist in the database and if it exist we want to change it. So if this product exist and if you want to change certain things about it what you can do is you can say db product dot and you can change the name of it. Let's say I want to change the name to uh a monitor. Okay, so this is how you can do it. Now you will say just by updating the value will it work? Yes, you just have to do one thing which is db.comit. And when you do this, whatever changes you have made to this this object, it will be committed in the database. Okay, but I don't want to set monitor. I want to set the values coming from the product. So name you can do something like this. And we don't even know which values have been changed. So we have to set all the values not just one. Uh maybe you want to change the ID as well but when you change the ID do you want to keep this option of saving changing the ID. No I don't want to change the ID. I will just start with the name because changing ID might create issues if you have a bigger application and that depend upon your ids. So let's not change it. So I'll say product dot description then db product dot price and this should be from product do.pric price dB product dot quantity and this will run product dotquantity. Okay. Now once you make all these changes just say commit. This will be saved in the database. If if is not executing you can simply print uh the else block which is return no object found. In fact here you can also return after committing product updated. So now let's see if this things works out. So I'll go back here and first of all let me just fetch uh let me just change uh seven here and I want to change this description here. I want to change the price as well. So what I can do is I can go to I want to I want to go to put and here I want to change this. So I want to make the changes to seven ID uh ID number let's say try ID number eight. And when you try to execute ID 8 it just it will say no product found but now I will say seven and I want to change ID anyway doesn't matter whatever you mention will not make any impact I want to change the name I will say notebook description I want to set okay there's a problem with the camel kissing okay so I want to set the description as my daily notes for work and let's say the price is now 9.99 $9 and the quantity is let's say we got 80. So we are making the changes and let's say execute will this work. Uh it says product updated but I want to verify that from the database. Execute this and yes things have been changed here. Okay cool. Uh we can even verify that from the all uh products. So you can see before running the query these are the old details. And now if I execute and those are your new details. Cool. Even put is working. Now let's try with the next one which is delete. So go back here. Delete the product. What we are going to do? So of course I don't want to use the for loop here. For deleting we can directly delete the product but then we need to first fetch the product from the database. So the same thing we'll be using this query because whenever you have an ID in the parameter you will be using this uh again we have to get the connection. So I will just use this copy and paste here. Okay. Now once you got the object first you will check if the DB product exist. If this exist uh then we'll do certain changes. Else will return product not found. So I will say else and block. Now in this what we are going to do is you will simply say DB dot delete and you can pass the DB product and that's it. This will delete it. The only thing you have to do is you have to also say commit at the end otherwise it it will not work. Committing is very important in life also when you are learning fast API complete it. Uh so let's go back now to the page and let's try to delete uh let's say I want to delete seven itself or maybe let's delete something in between. Let's say I want to delete this six number. So ID is six. So I will go down down down here. So come back here click on try it out. And now if you say seven click on execute okay I wanted to delete six why I don't know why I deleted seven. Uh it says null because we are not returning anything. But the status code is 200. That's great. So if you go to the pg admin run seven gone in fact I would also delete two because we wanted to delete something in between. So delete and again return null but we got status code 200. Let's verify from database. Looks cool. We can even verify that from the all products. Now that's a mutual right test it with all products and to gone okay so this is how basically you update delayed stuff now I know initially we started with the UI beautiful UI and now we are working with swagger don't worry once I make this thing working I will try to connect the react with this because there are certain changes which you have to make apart from DB database connections so we have talked about database and things are looking Good. So now it's time to go for the next step."

So in that case we have to use something called eield db and then after this you will close the connection. So you will say db do.c close. So basically this is where we are creating it. This is where we are waiting for the others to use it and then we'll close the connection. But it might happen something may go wrong with this. And even if something goes wrong or if it is not going wrong I want to make sure that we are closing the connection. So if you want to achieve that we'll have to say try and we'll put the close in the finally block so that it doesn't matter if something goes wrong here or not it will close the connection just to make sure because resources are very important. So what we are trying to do here is we'll every time someone wants to use the database they will inject this object or this method there. Now first of all what is dependency injection is so let's say if there's a method here which is uh get all products. Now get all products needs the object of DB. So basically they want the session object. So instead of creating the object here what we can do is we can tell hey I want this dependency because I can't work without this DB. So I want you to give me this dependency. So the fast API will inject this object. Okay that is called dependency injection. But then this get all products needs to ask for it. It will not give you by default. You have to ask for it. Now how do you ask for it? So it's simple. You say I want DB of type session. And you have to make sure that this is not session which we have created here. And this is something we have to import from SQL alchemy. So I will say import SQL alchemy. And okay. So from import you need to get session. So we want DB of type session. So you have to say this depends because this is where you are specifying that it depends on something and it depends upon get DB. So basically it will inject it here and since we are using dependency injection we have to also import that in the fast API. So I'll say depends here or maybe after fast API anyway it works. So let's go come back and we got it. So we got DB session equal to it depends upon this particular method which is get DB. So this is how basically you inject dependencies. Now once you have DB you you don't have to create this you can directly use it. So this line we can avoid now I can directly use it. So how exactly we are going to use it. Now I will create products or maybe I could say products from DB. So we'll say DB products equal to and we'll use a DB connection dot and we have to pass a query which we have done before but this time instead of getting the count I want to get uh all the details but of which type. So I will say database models dotprouct dotall. This will give me all the products and this is what we need to return now. So db products simple right? Uh now once we have done this it's time to test it on the server. So we'll go back to the browser and refresh this once. And now I'll say try it out. I want to fetch all the products. And this should give me all the products. But then I know you're not sure is it coming from database or is it just coming from uh the thing here. What I'm going to do is I'm going to make the change in the database. Let's see if that works. So to change it I will say update uh table name is product set. I want to set one thing. Let's say I want to change this table to uh laptop table. So set name is equal to laptop table where id is equal to what is id six. Hope this will work. Yeah it it worked updated. And now if I say select star from product execute and you can see this updated right table data uh table. Okay we what I have updated? What's wrong with me? Uh but okay I should have said laptop table or something. I said table table. I need to watch the video again. It doesn't matter, right? Something has changed. Now, let's verify that in the servers. If I execute this once more, execute. And you can see it stays table. So, yeah, we are right. So, this data is coming from database. So, yeah. So, we have done it. So, data is coming from database. Things are working out. I'm happy. I hope you are happy about this. And similarly, we can do things for get product by ID as well. So instead of getting it from the list, we have to get it from database. So what I'm going to do is this thing here this will change because now we are not using a for loop because for loop will iterate from the elements. I'll be saying product equal to and this product will have in fact you know everywhere I should mention DB product so that we'll know DB product equal to DB dotquery. We have to fire the query and we'll say which for which one. So models do product. Now you know dot now things will change here because here we are saying all here we have to say one we have we have to get only one not all but which one to specify that we'll use something called a filter so in the select query as well we if you want to filter the elements you basically use a wear clause this is how you do the wear clause you say filter and in this filter you specify for which particular table so you do that with the help of product you don't have to mention the table name you use the model itself and from the model you will compare the ID. So the ID should match with the ID. So the ID from the table should match with the ID which you are getting here. And if you find one, get the first one. So of course this will generate only one. But in case if you find multiple things, then you will pick up the first one. Okay. Uh we have to make one more change because you can see DB is giving error here because we are not added dependency. So I can just copy this line because this is what we are going to use everywhere. Now we just have to add the dependency. Now once you got the product now we don't have to compare that here. We we have done that in the filter. The only thing I want to check is if this product exist okay if this product exist return the product and this should not be outside right this should be in line. If this product exist return the product otherwise you can return product not found. Okay so even for one this is working now. Uh how do I verify? Go back to the swagger and uh since we have made changes let's refresh this and let's try to get one and we'll try to get this sixth one itself ID6 execute it should return table table yeah we got table table things are working out cool okay maybe if you try to fetch let's say nine which is not which does not exist it will return product not found so finally we are doing operations with database so we have done for the fetching let's do for the post Put and delete in the next"

So it's time to do that. Now what I want to do here is whatever data you have here, I want to put that in the database. The way we can do that is and I want to do that only once. Okay? So every time I open this application, it should check if the table is empty populate with dummy data. If you have any data, just don't do it. Now to achieve that, I'm going to create a function which will do that. And I will say this is initate DB. Initate DB. That makes sense and in this let's do those steps now. So the first thing we need here is we need the connection object. So basically we need to get the session which we have done before. In fact we have written that here but we are not using it. So in fact for some time now I will just comment this part and we'll use it later. So once we got the DB object let's try to add the product. So for product in products yeah let's try to add that in the DB. So it's a DB do. header. Okay. And then in this I have to add the object of the product. Okay. So I can simply say product here. But there's one little problem. Okay. So see see what we are trying to do is get the product from the list and add it in the database. As simple as that, right? So this is the code for this. But the problem is the DB is working with the database model class of product because this is connected to the SQL alchemy. But in the code the product which we are using is not SQL alchemy product. It is actually the model which we have created for with the help of Pythonic here and this will not work. Let me try it out. So let me say init DB and let's see if this works. Uh okay. So there is a problem here. So you can see it says models.product is not mapped because this thing is not mapped but this is mapped. So that means you can't pass the object of a product. You have to pass the object of database dot product object. This is what you have to pass. That means we have to find a way to basically convert this product into the product of the mapping which is database models. And how do we do it? It's very simple actually. You take this product which is from the pyic and convert that into the database model. Okay. So this thing has this feature where it will accept the key value pair from you and then it will create the object for it. So if you can pass that key value pair from the product your job is done. Now in order to do that what you can do is from the product there's a function called model dump. Now what this will give you this will give you a dictionary. So if you click here uh does it make yeah so you can see it gives you a dictionary. Okay. Now once you get this dictionary from the object. So product is the object from that you are getting the dictionary. Of course even dictionary will have a key value pair. But here for this product we don't need dictionary we need actual key value pair. So how do you convert your dictionary to key value pair is through unpacking and in python we know if you want to do unpacking you use double star. So when we say double star that's unpacking model dump will give you the dictionary from the object. So let me reiterate this will give you dictionary and this will give you key value pair. And once we do that there is no issue. Perfect. And now the application ran. If I check the tables, if I execute this query, we're still not working. You know why it's not working? Because we are adding but we are not committing because in one of the configuration we are mentioning auto commit is false and that's why it is not running. So what I will do is I will do the commit and I will do the commit after the for loop. Once everything is done, I will say db do. And our job is done. Let's see. Run and voila. Okay. So, it's that simple. Okay. So, you don't have to write SQL queries. You just say add. It's just that the only point where we struggle is when you wanted to add the product and you have to make sure that you're adding a product of database models not of parentic model. And uh to you have to basically convert the parentic object using model dump which will give you a dictionary. and then you have to unpack it using star which it will get and this will just get those values and create the object for you. So a lot of things SQL alchemy is doing for you is just that it's happening behind the scene and you just have to follow the protocols. Okay. So this looks good but now we got an error because again I have saved it. Now when you save it two times what happens is it will reload the server and every time you reload it will basically execute this the queries and then you can't have duplicate values right? So ID is a primary key. So you can't have duplicate values there. And that's why you got error here. So it's trying to insert. But we have a problem. So I don't want to call this every time uh we load this. It should do its job only when the table is empty. So we can basically check before you do that. So let's say I can use a count variable and the count variable is zero by default. And here I can check if the count is zero in that case you do this steps otherwise don't do it. First I have to fire the query to database and then it should get returned the count. To do that I will just say here db dot query because you have to f the query now. So when you want to fetch you use query if you want to add you can directly use add method and then here you have to specify for which particular table you are passing a query. In fact you have to specify the model itself and you you can have multiple models in your project. Right? So we'll say database models dot product and then you will say I want the count. So this will fire a query which is select count star from the table which will give you the count and now this should not be an issue. So if I save this code let's see if the server is running so there's no problem. Okay and anyway in the normal project we not we don't even do this right because data will be already there or maybe you want to add the data manually. I just wanted to show you if you want to have initial data you can do this but with this we have one little problem. The problem is with every function like get all methods or get product by id whenever you want to use database connection you have to basically do this line uh db equal to session and then every time you use this you are creating a session then you're not closing it uh that's not a good idea so what we should be doing is we should be doing that one place where when you need it it will use it and then the connection will be closed and also your fast API provides a feature of dependency injection. So we can use that as well. Now how do we do it?"

Uh so let's get back here. I don't know why how this got open. Let's go get back here and create database models py. Now this models is for the pyntic. This is for the database for the SQL command. Okay. And I'm so lazy. I'll just copy this because this will be same. I mean not exactly same similar. And uh this will change. Now this was base model from parentic. Instead of using pyntic base model, I want to use base from SQL alchemy. Now how SQL alchemy will know that this product is supposed to be linked with table or database is because of this base. Now what is this base? There's not a inbuilt keyword. Uh but you have to use something called base equal to declarative base and this thing you have to import. So this function will create the base for you which you can use to inhite your class. But you need to import this. So from SQL alchemy dot extension dot from declarative it will import declarative base. Okay. Certain things you have to remember. So declarative base comes from this and once you get this object you can basically or once you get this class you can pass it here. And if you go to base declarative base I'm just checking the documentation. Okay coming back here. So once you got this you now this class is ready to be mapped to the tables but then this will not work. We have to do some changes here. So instead of specifying type we have to actually assign the type to it. So you will say ID equal to and now we have to specify something called column in which you have to specify all different values. Is it a integer or a string or is it a primary key or not or do you want to do indexing or not? So those thing you can do with the help of column and that's why it is different from the model class the bilentic model but you need to import this. So from SQL alchemy we'll import we need column. Now we'll also be using the type. So let's import that as well which is integer. Apart from integer we are going to use two more types which is string and float. Now if you remember in the models in fact here itself. So we got string and float and int. So we'll import those things here and this particular class which is column. So here let's pass in the constructor. The first thing you have to pass is it's of type integer. Then you have to specify do we have to use primary key. This is a primary key. Yes, true. T should be capital. And do you want to do indexing as well for faster processing? I will say yes. On the primary key there should be. So this is how basically you create the primary key just by mentioning primary equal to true. And for the other columns, we don't have to mention everything else. Just column and the type for it. This will be of type string. And you have a choice of adding the indentation for this as well or indexing for this as well. So we'll be using equal to column of type string, column of type I think it was float and column of type integer. So these things we need here. And also you can basically create or you can add a table name here. So you can say table name which uh your SQL may be used for storing. So you can have the same name product or if you want to have something else you can add it here. Uh I'll get I will go with the same name product and I think that's it. This looks cool. Now once we have defined our model I'm expecting that this should reflect in my database. Okay. Uh let's see. First of all, we are not running the front end and back end. Both are in the stop state. Is it? No, front end is still running. The back end is stopped. I can just run the back end. Okay, back end is running. And now I can go back to my database. We are using post uh posguis and this is pg admin. And if you have not logged in here, you can basically click here. It will ask you for your password. Just just enter that and then scroll down to your database. So the database we are using is Cisco. and make sure you have database because SQL Alchemy is not going to create database. It is going to use database and create tables. So create that table database by yourself. You can right click here and say create database. Simple stuff. Once you get this database here, expand and go to schemas. This is where you will find the schemas. And in schemas, scroll down, go to tables. And this is where you will see the tables. But even if I refresh, the tables are not there. We have done the mapping, right? table why tables are not there because nowhere we have mentioning that hey SQL alchemy you have to create a table we have to mention that somewhere so where do we do it let's go back to main and let's specify somewhere that hey you are responsible to create the tables and the way you can do that is by using the database models okay do we have to import database models yes so so import database models okay and once you have database models you can use your base now base will say okay I this my job here was to do the inheritance part and I I've done that. Apart from it you can also get the meta data of that particular class product. Now how do you get the metadata? You just use the metadata and based on the metadata. So in this metadata you'll be having a table name. You'll be having the column names. You'll be having a type of it and based on it you will say create all. So whichever class inheriting base just create a table and then you will say binding will be with the engine. There are multiple ways you can do the binding you can do with the help of connections and stuff but we are using engine which we have created here uh in the database. This is the engine but this is giving error because we are not importing engine. So from database we have to also import engine. Okay. Now this line will create the tables for you. But we are seeing error here. Oh, looks like this should be small. I don't know why I've written capital I there. Okay, looks good. No problem. Now the server is running. But I want to verify that by going to the database. Let's refresh the table. And voila, you can see we got a table. In this table, we got the columns. In this column, we got ID, name. In fact, the best way to see this is by uh right clicking on the product and say view. You can write the SQL query as well but I'm lazy. So I'll say view data all rows and you got your table here. You can say we got ID, name, description, price and quantity. And look at the types as well. Additionally, this is a primary key. Perfect. So table got created but table is empty. So this is a query is executing but the table is empty. You know what we have to do now? We have to basically save all this default data in the database so that we can fire the query. How do we do that? Uh let's see that in the next video."

So we got SQL alchemy and we also got the posgris driver it's time to start with the configuration. Now why do we need configuration? So let's say if I go back to main now this is where we are and let's say if I now say in this get all products instead of returning this particular list which we are doing here I want to connect to database. So of course before we do this there should be some database connection. So I will write some statements here. Okay, again I have to disable or snooze my copilot. Okay, I will write in a comment. I need uh database connection because without database connection how will you connect to database and once you are connected then you want to fire some query right uh which will do. So here we have to write some query. So first we have to create database connection and then we can write the query. Now we know that in fact in the previous video we have talked about we are going to use SQL alchemy. So I want to create this database connection which talks to the SQL alchemy and to do that of course I can do all the configuration in this file but it's better to have in a separate file and this I will say database py or you can say config. py whatever works for you. So I will say database py and this is where you have to do do the configuration. So basically what you need the first thing you need here is something called session local. Now using this session local we have to first of all create this object here so that we can use that object in our main file. So database connection. So we'll be using session local to access the data database. But how do you create object of session local? Now first of all what is session? So every time you connect to something it's a session. So if you connect to a server that's one session. If you connect to a database that's one session. Okay. And you you need to create a session before you do this operations. Now to create a session we got something called a session maker. So you'll be using that and this will create the object of session local. But then from where you are going to get this session maker also uh for session local you can name it anything. If you want to use it as only session that works uh this is just a variable. Now to get the session maker you need to import that from SQL alchemy and that too from SQL alchemy because we are going to use ORM here and I'm going to import session maker. Okay, this is an inbuilt part. We just have to use it. So you can see session maker is a class and we just have to call the constructor. It will create the object for us. But then this session maker will take some parameters. The first parameter it will take is the for the commit. So whenever you do database transactions normally we have to do the commit for it but by default it will be auto commit we have to disable it. So we'll say auto commit equal to false and you can get these values uh from the session maker. So if you scroll down there should be this variables which you have to assign. Okay there's one constructor which is engine. We'll be passing that as well and there should be another constructor which will take all these values. So we can see we have something called auto flush and there should be something with the commit. We'll do auto flush as well but I'm looking for the commit. Where is it? I should have searched for it. But sometimes trolling works because you come across certain new things. Uh but still I will now search for auto commit. Yeah. So this is auto commit and I think by default is false. So that's we can we don't have to set that auto flush is true. So we have to disable this but we'll disable both. Okay. So we'll come back here and this is false and we'll also do auto flush as false not true. And then the third part is you have to set the engine. Now remember remember when we looked at that there is also engine which you have to set the value for. And we can do that with the help of bind. Bind equal to engine. Now what is this engine here? Now engine here helps you to connect with the database because you have to also specify the which database you're working with because nowhere we have mentioned that now. So for your Python application yes you're connected to the database but which one we have no idea it can be MySQL, Postgress, Oracle. So you have to mention that also for the particular DBMS you have to also set the username and password. So we can do that with the help of engine. So you can say create engine and this is where you have to pass all the values. So in this you have to pass which DBMS you're working with what is the link to connect to it username and password and what is your database name and we can put that here and the ideal way of doing that is something called a DB URL so I will create a DB URL here and let's create a URL which is post SQL col// localhost col 5432 that's a port number and then you have to mention your database now this particular URL is pretty common whenever you work with RDBMS. If you're working with let's say MySQL, you will say MySQL colost 5 430 the score. No, so for MySQL, the port number changes. I I think I forgot the port number for MySQL. I think it's 3306. And if you you're using Oracle, you have to put the port number for Oracle, which starts with one and ends with seven. I forgot the number, but you got the point, right? Uh this will change and this will change. But also, I want to specify the username and password. But I know where I'm doing that. So that multiple ways of doing this because if you click on create engine, okay, I'm not able to go inside it. Okay, it's because it's not able to detect it. So I will import that as well from SQL alchemy and import create engine. Okay, now I should be able to click it. So you can see it is asking you for the URL and also you can pass certain other parameters. Okay, but then I'm not going to pass those things from here. I mean separately the username password I'm going to pass in the URL itself and yes you can do that. So the the basic syntax is you mention posgris sql slash and then after two slash you mention your username for posgress the default username is posgress itself and then you give a colon and then you specify the password I'm just guessing the password for this particular machine is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 for for posgress let's see if it is working or not and then you say at the rate so username password at the rate localhost colon the port number/ database This is the URL which you have to work with and the same URL now you just have to pass it here. So DB URL and your job is done by doing this you are now able to connect with the database hopefully. Hopefully okay let's keep it as session if that works. So we got session uh session maker and these things. Now once you have your database py file ready it's time to go for the next step. The next step is very simple. Go back to main and here instead of database connection we can create the object for session which we have done that before or maybe I will just write DB and I can say session but now if you see this is not recognizing because it's a part of database I just have to import this. So come back here and say from database import session we can get the access to it and I think there's no problem. You can see there's no problem here. And now with the help of DB, you can fire the query. As simple as that. Okay. Once you get the hold of DB, you can fire the query. So I can say DB dot there's option of query in which you have to pass the query. Uh but then what exactly the query I'm going to pass here? Am I going to write the actual SQL query? Uh of course not because we are using SQL alchemy. So we I want to use the OM feature of that. I just have to work with the Python objects and it should create the query for me. So if I want to say save it, it should create the insert query. If I say fetch, it should create a select query. The SQL alchemy should do that. But the question arise nowhere we have done the mapping for the database and the class. The class is there. Okay. The class is there but this class is pilentic. Okay. And when you try to connect with the SQL alchemy, it will say okay something is not matching. It's not my syntax. So you have to basically create another product class for the SQL alchemy for the database. So the database schema will be created based on that particular class of product and plus you can mention the column types you can mention what column you're working with column name column type and if you want to add some filters to it or the special access let's say if you want to specify a particular column as a primary key so you can you should be able to do that here I mean not here because this is a parentic based model you can't basically add hey this is a primary key you have to do that in this separate class and also there's No way here you can change the table name because it's a pyic again. So you need a class of product for the pyic for the data validation and you you need a separate class of product for the SQL alchemy. And how do we create that? Let's see that in the next"

So whatever option we were doing like creating, updating, uh deleting and reading this should be done through the database. Now database you can use anything which you want. Maybe a CSV file, you can use uh NoSQL databases or you can use RDBMS. And here we are going to use the R DBMS. Now you have multiple options to work with. You can use MySQL, you can use Postgress, you can use Oracle, whatever you prefer. Now I'm going to use posgress but because it's one of the best advanced open-source uh tool that's what they say. So if you go to posgris this is what they say the world most advanced opensource relational database but of course there are other options as well whichever you prefer will work. Now question arise how will we are going to do this? Now whenever you work with fast API one of the recommended way is to go with SQL alchemy. But why we need to use SQL alchemy here? Now SQL alchemy is your Python SQL toolkit that's good the other options as well but it also provides you something called a object relational mapper. Now why this is important see if you go back to our code which we have done we basically have a class right a class like this where you have a product and then you got certain fields there. Now let's say if you want to create a database and if you want to create a table. Now if I ask you hey you got this particular class here and I want you to create a table for it. Now in your mind actually you can do the mapping right? You can say okay I got a class which is product. Let me create a table called product. I got this fields like ID, name, description, price, quantity. I can create the table with those columns like ID, name, description, price and quantity. As simple as that, right? So, and then you got the table name, you got column names, but you also got the column type because in the class also when you define those properties, you mentioned, hey, that's an ID which is integer. So, here also we can say integer. Now, based on what DBMS you're working with, uh the name will change from numbers to integer. So, here we can have string or wcad or text and list goes on. So, the type defined in the class will be defined for the table as well. But you will say okay mapping is done but what about the data? What about the row data? So each row will represents one object. So let's say we have created four products right that was in the list. Now each product here is the object of a product class. Now that object goes to database and becomes a row. So what we are trying to do here is we are trying to connect the object and the relations which is tables and we are doing a mapping for it and that's what we call or RM. Now you will say what's the benefit of it? You know this looks fancy but why do we use it? See when you work with databases like let's say posgress or MySQL and if you have a language like Python and whenever you want to save data basically what you will do is you will take the object and this object will have the values. Now you will write the SQL query. So let's say if you want to create a new record in the database. So you will write the SQL query which is insert. So you will say insert into product. Then you will say values and in bracket you will mention the values. Right? Now from where you will get this values from the object then manually you have to pick up the value from the object put it there. Pick up the value put it there. So you have to create that query as a developer. So that's for the insert. What about let's say if you want to fetch then you will write the query which is select star or based on what columns you want to fetch based on how many rows you want to fetch you will write the query in that format what if you want to update for everything you got queries and you have to write those queries now you will say okay I know how to work with queries but the question is do you want to really write that in the python code what if someone else can do it for you so they will say let me give you a tool use this and let me take care of creating all the queries for you. You just say if you want to insert, you just say add. If you just want if you want to fetch maybe you can say get whatever method is. So basically you can use those methods or functions and this will do the things for you. Cool, right? And that's why we are going to use SQL alchemy. Then the question is how do you get this in your project? Now if you head back to your project here, okay, let me stop the server because we are going to make some changes. Now if I check pip list, nowhere you will find SQL alchemy. You will get pyic by default but nowhere we got SQL alchemy right. We need to get that. Apart from it we also need to get the driver for posgris. Now based on what DBMS you're working with. So if you're working with MySQL you need a MySQL driver. If you're working with posgris you need a postgris driver. And we need those two things in this project. SQL Alchemy and the driver for Postgress. So let's install it. So I will say PIP install. So we need SQL Alchemy and we also need the driver which is psy cop G2. I don't know why they went for this weird name uh because this is PG makes sense posgress and uh psycho. If anyone knows this let me know in the comments. I've not not explored why they have this weird name. uh forc for my it's a very simple MySQL connector for Python perfectly makes sense right but I don't know why they went for this name but this is a driver for posgress and this is your SQL alchemy and you have to also make sure and before you work with posgris you have to also make sure that you have posgris in your machine if you don't have it click on download it will download the postgris for you based on which OS you're working with I'm using windows and these are the version I think in my machine I got 17 or 16 doesn't matter because the last update was in 2022. So that is 17.6. Uh they are releasing the beta. 18 beta is released. That's great. Uh if you want to use beta, you can try it out. But if you're new to the development world, stick to the stable versions because if something goes wrong, you will always blame the system because it's in beta. Maybe it's your mistake. Now when once you get experience, once you have worked on multiple project and if you if something goes wrong, you can still blame it. But at least you will know are you really responsible for it anyway. So you will get this download. Now make sure that when you get this you also get PG admin. Now if you don't have PG admin in your machine uh or if you don't get this by default search for PG admin somewhere and you should be able to get it. I think you will get that by default. PG admin. There should be a tick mark. Now how the PG admin looks like. So this is how the PG admin I'm just opening it now looks like bit heavy to start with in fact earlier PG admin 3 was very heavy four they have changed the interface to make it lightweight but since it's connected with the posgress service which is running behind the scene uh it takes time so by time it is opening let me just go back to our code and let's install this so this should take some time now since I already had this in my system it will be faster Yeah, it it was fast. And now if I check PIP list, there should be SQL alchemy and there should be the driver. Perfect. Now once you got these two things, we can get started and work with the database. Okay, but I I also want to show you the PG admin. This is how it looks like. Uh I should zoom it a bit. Okay. So this is PG admin and by default I think you have to add the server by specifying the username password. Username by default will be posgrisis. The password you have to set when you're installing it. And I forgot what is my password for this particular pg admin. But we'll figure it out because I use different machines for uh project and for recording and I always mess up the names. Okay. So we'll use this. We'll try to save our data in the postgris database. And if you're using MySQL, the only thing you have to change is uh in fact you have to change two things. One is a driver and second some lines in the database connection. That's it. And it will work. How that works? Let's see that in the next"

So basically, if you want to update the product or you want to delete a product, how will you do it? So that's what we're going to see now. Now before I do that, I just want to remove this extra spaces from here. And let's look at the code. So basically, we got this main. py where we got all the product in the list. We are still not working with database. And we basically have this methods like get and post. Now in this get we are fetching all the products and in this get we are fetching a product by its id and then here we are basically adding a new product. Okay. Uh so now let's try to update it. But before we do that in fact there lot of things which have to do before we do that because if you can see my shirt color has changed. It's a new day and I have to do that steps once again to run this. So first of all I will run this server. Before that I have to change my environment. So the virtual environment it is using now. Oh, it is creating a new environment. No, no, don't create a new environment. I'm using a wrong thing. I I I have to activate it. So activation done. And now it's time to run this. And also I will disable my copilot or snooze it for some time. And let's run this. And this will load the server. No problem with the server loading. And we have to also run the front end. Make sure that you don't run this in the environment. So you have to deactivate this so that you will come out of the environment and now you can run the front end and you have to switch to front end and say npm start. Now the front end started as well. Uh but again we the front end is not fully configured yet and that's why you can see it is failed to fetch. So there's no need to run the front end. I don't know why I run that muscle memory maybe. Uh but let me just go with this. So there's a problem with the front end. That's fine. Okay. Okay, but but the back end is running and the way you can test it, you can just go to local host 88 uh 8,000 and then slash here we have to say docs which will load your uh swagger in which you can test all the things and we need to first test it out if it is working so that we can continue. So it's still working nothing is wrong yet. Okay so let's go back here and now it's time for the update. Now if you want to update a product how will you do it? First of all, you need a function and we'll name this as a update product function. And then this will uh also accept the product itself. But then with product, we have to also pass the ID. So which particular product you want to update, right? So you can ask for the ID. So I will say ID of type int. And then you will also ask for the product because that's what you're going to update. Now if you want to update a particular field of a product, you can also use patch. But we'll not be doing that here. We'll be only using put and this is where you will update and we also do the mapping for this. This should be app dot instead of using get or post we are going to use put and here we'll say the same URL which is product. Cool right and now I can basically write the logic for updating our product. So it says there's an error on line number 36 and there is an error. So you can say it is expecting a block but I'm going to write a code for updating. Now when you want to update you want to update the product from the products list with this particular product right and uh which one to update. Now you have to basically iterate between these products to find which ID is matching with 1 2 or five and six and then you can do it. So in that case I can say use a for loop. I'm going to start with I uh in range or maybe I can also use product but then I can't replace it. So let's go with the range itself because I want the uh index of it. So I will say uh for i in range and I will go till the last value and for that I have to say I mean second last value. So length of products. Now once you have this range it will start from zero it will end at three because we only got four products here right and of course in future if you add a new products this will go to the second largest value. So if the value if the length is 10 it will go till 9. Okay then you will basically check for each product. So you can check products of zero or sorry products of i and then you can check the ID if it is matching. Okay, if it is matching that means I have to use if it is matching with the id whatever you have passed in that case for that location that means products of I for that location replace it with the product which you got from the client looks good and if this is successful you will return product added successfully again this should be a JSON data but I'm sending a plain text but that's fine it it works and what if you don't find any products Of course, this will come out from there and then you will say return no product found or you can say product not found whatever works. So this is the update code and I want to verify if this is working. So the moment I saved it this got reloaded. I can go back to swagger now or the docs refresh this and first of all let's get all the products from here and we'll update one of it. So execute and you got all the products. Let's say I want to update uh this table here. So I will just copy this and the ID is six. Remember that go back to put because this is what you want to do update product and you will update. So you will say try it out type here six and replace this schema with your schema. In fact you can uh change the values from here but I will just paste it. Then I will keep the idea same. I will change it to table and a wooden table for your computer. Okay. And then price since we have added this description the price should go up. That's what we do, right? And let's say the quantity remains 20. Okay. So we have changed name, price, description but not ID and quantity. Let me execute. Let's see what goes wrong. Nothing went wrong here. Uh it says product added successfully. That's great. That means if you go back now here and if you try to execute this once again and look at the product. So we got table test changed uh description changed price change. Okay, that's how update works. But now let's work with delete. So let's go back here and now you help me. It's okay. Now the question is how will you help me when you're watching this video? Think just think about it. What will be the logic? I will get it. telemetry. Uh so I will say app dot it should be delete the method. Okay. And then you have to also pass the URI. We'll go with the same URI. And as I mentioned before all these URIs are same. What is changing is the method here. Okay. So let's define a method. So we'll say define delete or def delete product. Okay. Now question arise based on what value you want to delete. Maybe a user will send the entire product and then you can delete it or uh id is enough right because every product will be different based on its ID. So you can simply pass an ID here. Let's do that. So except the id. So I'll say id colon int and based on the id will delete it. But again you have to iterate right because you have to match with the id is matching with. So we'll say for in fact the same code which we have written before for range and this will be length of products and then you can check if products of I in fact you have to match the ID if it is matching with the ID which you mentioned from the client side. In that case delete the products of I. As simple as that. And if this works you can return product deleted. And what if you don't find the product? So you have to some mention that somewhere. So we say return same thing product not found. So once we are writing no product product found and once we are we're writing uh product not found. Uh there should be some consistency right and I'm not doing it. Okay. So we got this products here. Right now I want to delete let's say uh six itself or maybe in between. Let's say I want to delete the second one two. So the ID is two. Let's go back to uh okay I think we have to reload this put and delete. Delete is here and we are going to delete two. So I will just type two here and execute. Nothing much. And it says product deleted. That's great. Let's go back to get all products. Try it out. Execute. And here we go. You can see we don't have to anymore. And that's how you update and delete. But I want to show you the code once again and this is it. So this is update product where you are getting the ID getting the product the new details which you want to add and then you are iterating and then you are basically checking for each ID if it is matching or not. The moment you find the match you will update the product from the list and that's how you update. For delete same code it's just that instead of updating we are deleting it. Cool right? uh but then remember everything what we have done now we are doing with in-memory list so this is a list but in the real world we don't use list right we use a permanent storage maybe like posgress or MySQL or any type of database it can be RDBMS it can be nosql databases or somewhere maybe a file or maybe a CSV file so let's see how do we do that in the upcoming"

Let's say if I pass an ID one, we want that in this case. How will you do it? It should be simple, right? Let me create a new function and this time I will say get product by ID. Okay, so it should accept an ID and based on that it will it should return the product. Now at this point I'm just going to pass a variable here. Let's say ID and this will be of type int. This is the variable I'm going to work with. And based on the ID should return and of course there should be a mapping as well. So let's say at app.get and then you have to specify the URL and of course that should be product or maybe you can say products but let's say product slash u now so let's say if you simply say product and by default I'm assuming the ID is one. How will you do it? So one of the easy ways if you know that the ID will be always in sequence and there's no missing point uh you can simply say uh you can use the feature of list where you can fetch a particular element based on the ID something like this I can say return uh product and then I can specify let's say if I'm assuming that's a first element I can simply return by zero that should work right and let's say we are not even using that so we can remove this till this point and at this point and let's work with it And now let me hit this URL product not from the swagger but from here localhost col 8000/ product not products product enter and this is returning the first product. Okay, that's cool. But every time it will return the first product. And the second problem is what if you want to fetch the product ID two and two itself is a first product. Then this will work. I mean this will not work. That means uh because it will always return zero and even if you say one, what's the guarantee that the second product has the ID two? No guarantee, right? Even if you want to fetch the ID with two, in that case you have to pass two. Okay. So what you will do is you will map it with two so that you will get two and now I can just say one because that's that is two okay now that's a problem right I got two here and I want to use that two here how will I use this two here that's that's crazy now we can what we can do is we can hardcode so for two it should return uh with ID two we can do some coding for that and for three we should do do some coding for that and for four we should do some coding for that uh what if you have 100 products You have to get 100 methods. That means we have to make this two dynamic. In this case, if you want to make it dynamic, just put it in curly brackets and use a variable name. Let's say ID. So you can say product / ID. But don't mention ID. Mention the number and that number will come here because this is a dynamic path and you can use that path here. So you can say ID type int. So whatever name you are going to use here, use the same name and you're okay. And now I can use this ID. So I can simply say id minus one. That should work right. Let's try. So go back here and now product slash. If you say one, you will get the first product. If you say two, you got the second product. And I will also do pretty here. And if I say four, you will get fourth product. But if you say six, it will say internal server error. And there will be error here as well. So because we are going out of list. Okay. And that's why you have to handle the exceptions. But I'm not going to do that. I'm just want to make it simple. Uh this is working. But then the problem is what if you don't have a product like this. Maybe you have product five and six here. But still this will not work. So even if you say six enter, it will say internal error because here we are sending the request 6 - 1 which is five and we don't have the sixth element. Okay, this is not the right logic. So let me just write the right let me just write the correct logic here. So we have to search the products for the ID. So I'm just going to iterate product in products and then here I'll check if the ID provided by the product or one of the product. If that ID matches with this ID in that case return the product. If it is matching return the product otherwise you can return product not found. Okay. Uh that should work but there is an error here. There should be double equal to no problem. Now cool. Let me go back here. And now let's fetch for six. It is working. Perfect. If you search for four, there's no product as four. So it says product not found. Just to verify, there's no ID four here. Okay. And what if you want to do it for two? It is working. So this is how you fetch a single product. Okay, that's the logic. Okay. So that's for fetching all the records, one record. But now what if you want to add a record? So maybe we have four. I want to add more. In that case, what you will do is uh let's create a function and this will be add product. And now you can guess I don't have to tell you now. Uh you guessed it right. We have to say app dot. Now we can't use get because we are submitting data. We are creating a resource. In that case you have to say post and then the URL. The URL will be same as previous which is product. We don't have to modify that. How will you differentiate between a single product or this this slash and this one is because of the get and post. Now how will you add a product? So we have a in my list here. I can simply say the products in this I want to add. So product dot we have a method called append in list. We can use that and we can append it with oh we can append it with what we are sending data from there. We have to also accept that data here. Now in which format you will get the data? you will get the data in the format of product itself. So you will get the product of type product. So just get that and add it here. Okay. So what we're doing here is we are creating a method called add a product of type post. So you can see we have we have this we have this URL which is product and then from the client side you have to send the product details that will go here and then you are appending. But the question is how will you send this data? Okay. So let me just save this. So now we have to also return I say return whatever we are getting just return that okay but how will you make this work this is this should be a bit tricky let's try first of all we can't do that from the browser directly we need a react application or I can use swagger because for post you need a form okay we don't have a form here but swagger says don't worry I will take care of it just refresh the swagger now I don't want to greet I just want all the products I will just keep it open uh and I will open the add product. Okay, in fact we have okay let's just test add product and if you expand add a product it will give you some details the of course you can click on try it out but it will give you a schema okay default schema where you can add the elements or add the values and let's see so I will just click on try it out and you can edit this values now so let's say this is eight and I'm going to add a new product let's say watch from I will say Titan watch and the size is let's say $80 and the quantity we have is let's say 50 because we have it okay so this is the data which we have to add and this has to be in a JSON format so when you click on execute this data goes to the server and you can see this is the request it is sending using curl behind the scene and the URL okay so there is some problem it is sending request for product oh I forgot to add a slash here one slash And this is what happens. Okay. Uh let me just copy this so I don't I don't have to type it again. Uh execute. So do I need to refresh this add product. We'll say try it out. Paste. Execute. And yeah, this time it worked. You can see there's no error. This is the URL and you got the data here and this is 200. But how do we check if this get got added to the list? Let's go up. Let's see all the products. Try it out. Execute. This is what we have done hardcoded. And this is the new data. Okay, things are working out. So this is how you fetch all the record. This is how you fetch one record. And this is how you work with uh posting the new record. This is working. Now it's time for the next two methods which is put and delete which we'll see in the next"

",IN,https://yt3.ggpht.com/0nsZM3NF0C9bFr2IFXicMJ1w82ldRaZvGKFnezBe2lpW7F9gI92FaLubcTghnNNt4Ld8DfRvEMo=s800-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj,2680000,2100,true,"So this is fine where you are requesting for the homepage and you are writing a text but then if you remember we started with a application where we want to work with the products. A product will have an ID it will have a name uh the description the price the quantity now how we are going to do that of course I can just change this URL. So instead of having homepage I can say uh slash products. Now that's how you do it for the rest API. Now whenever you visit a page let's say if you go to Google and if you search for Terisco of course you will get all these details here but look at the address bar. So it is google.com/ because that's the homepage then slash search because now we have a different path right so we are searching and then we are passing a query so you put a question mark and then you say the the variable Q equal to the list. So this is what we are searching right. Ignore the other parts. This is just for the other things. So we can just ignore this. This is the important stuff. So search that's the path and then question mark q equal to list. Now this is how you basically do the query. Now when you visit a page and if you want to pass the query as well, this is the obvious way. But then if you want to search something as a resource because all the products online or in the database in the back end, they are the resources. So you are requesting for a resource. So instead of saying uh Koshima Q there should be a different way uh something like this. So let's say if I want to search about products and I will go with the google.com this will not work but I just want to show you how it works how it looks basically. So it is google.com/roucts. Now it will it should give me all the products from the database. Okay that's my expectation. Then if you want a specific product let's say if you want a product ID with one product ID with two then you will say slash one. This will give me the first product. This will give me second product and then so on. What if you want to uh add a new product? Now this is where the things will change. Now if you want to add a product, how will you do it? So will you say add here? Now that is not how you do it. So basically what we what happens is for the fetching you know when you want to read you will use the same link and for posting as well when you want to add a new product you will use the same URL. And now you will say okay how will a browser differentiate between when when I want to fetch data and when I want to save data. And this is where the HTTP methods comes into picture which we have talked about before. So when you want to fetch data that's when we are going to use get. So the same URL or the same URI but the method will be get. If you want to submit something if you want to post you will be using the same URL but different method name. Okay, that remember that point because we are going to do that in this particular project. So now I want to fetch the products right now before you even fetch the products, you need to have the products. Now how we are going to do that? Uh since it's already opened here, so the libraries are already opened. I don't want to uh open again. So if you see we have also added pilente. Now we have not added manually when you ask for uh uicon you got this by default and this is what we are going to use now. Cool. So what it basically does so pyic is basically for data validation. Okay. And also if you want to convert your data from the server side into JSON format to send it to the client we are going to use this. Again this will make much more sense once we do the coding for it. The first thing we're going to do here is now since I want to work with the products, what I will do is I will just go back here and say app dot uh again a get request but this time instead of saying slash okay I have to snooze my co-pilot and then here it will be products because that's what I'm asking for and I want to say get okay and I'm expecting all the products not just one product and here I can define a function and all these functions are by default async so you don't have to mention async and then I will say get all products If you can be better with the uh name of the methods, it will be helpful to read. And then this is where you will return the products. At this point, I'm just going to return all products just to see if things are working out or not. So, I will just save this. So, when you save it should reload and then let's go back here and instead of hitting the homepage and I'm just hitting the homepage just to check if everything is working. I will say products. Enter. And you can see it says all products. Awesome, right? But then we don't want text as all products. We want the actual products and not from the database because we have not done the setup for the database yet. So we'll do that later. So let's say we we have a inme list. We want to work with it. So there should be a list somewhere here. And let me just create in fact you know we are done with this. I can remove this or maybe just keep it there. Why not? Uh let's me let me just create a list here somewhere here. But then how will I create the list of products because of course this is a list of products but then we don't have a products there. There are different ways of doing it. Of course I can just create uh a dictionary here by specifying all the values. That's one way of doing it. Otherwise if you go with the object- oriented way which is a better way here. What I can do is I can create a models or maybe I can create a product file but models make sense because these things are called models which holds data or which is used to represent any data. So example if you want to represent all the users of a system. So that's one model. So you can create a user model and this will represent the users because a model will have a name and it will have some properties. Example here let me get a class and this will be product and this will have some attributes. So I will say id of type int then we can have name of type str then I can have also have a description here of type str then we can have a type of price which can be float and then last thing we need is quantity of type int. Okay so these are the things you need. So basically you can represent the data in this format. So you can create one product which will have all these properties right and then you can just go back here and create those objects right so I can use the constructor of it I can say product but then to use the constructor I don't have it here and I can just ask for the constructor so this is the constructor I hope this will work I have not tried this before for this application because we were using py but let me try so I will say ID is equal to one or maybe I can just pass the value name I will say phone. Okay, it says product is not defined. Uh what I will do is I will just import this. So from models import uh product. Okay, now there's no issue. And I can add description. So name is int is done. I mean the ID is done. Uh name is done. Description I'll say budget phone. And then let's say the price is $99. And the quantity let's let's say we have 10 of it. So at this point I just have one product or maybe I can add one more just by giving a comma here. So two laptop gaming laptop triple 9 and let's say we got six quantity of this. So we got this two products and now instead of returning all the products here I can return the products itself. Right? So what it will do now is when you request for the products it it should return this list. And let's see if this works. Okay. I'm not sure. Let me try. I will say enter. Oh, we got it. So you can just repetitify this and you can see we got the data in this format. So this thing works. So basically we can just create this thing and you can return it from here. Now this is one way right and this is working nothing wrong with it. The problem is in future maybe you want to do data validation. So let's say when you are send this when you want to send this from the client side to the server maybe maybe a client want to add a new product and when you say you want to pass the ID the client is sending an ID let's say 10 that works what if the client sends the ID as minus one or minus 10 that will an issue and this will accept it right this will not say any problem there because it's an integer uh what if you pass a price which is negative of course p should not be negative what if you pass the description of only one character That doesn't make sense. Why description will be of one character, there should be at least two words. Even if you're lazy. Okay. So how do you do that validation? And that's where we got this particular library called pyic which will help you for the data validation. So we have already seen that. Now how do you make this as a py? So it's very simple. You come back in the models and here you can just import. You can say from py tech because that's what you want to use. We just need one thing from that which is a base model. So I can say import base model. Of course you can take it lot of things from there. So you can import all these things from it and we are going to use some of them later like field but here okay I'm deleting that part. I will just import parentic import uh base model. This is what you need and then you basically inherit because if you want to achieve that feature you will simply do inheritance and you got it. You got your base model. Now you don't even need to create this constructor by yourself. that is done taken care of and things you need to change is instead of specifying this syntax it should be with the variables because that makes much more sense right why do you pass in this format so ID equal to and then the list goes on now instead of typing in fact this should be name so instead of typing all these things I I just I do have the data ready with me I'll just copy paste that oh wait instead of saying copy paste I should say code reuse so paste and we got it. So you can see we got ids, we got four ids because we got four products and then we got phone, laptop, pen, table which is a name and then we got description, we got the price and we got the quantity. Now with this changes, let me just go back here and refresh. You should be able to see all this. Now if you're not able to see in this format, you just have to uh download this extension called pretty print from the chrome and you will see in the proper format. Now there's one way. Okay, but what if you don't want to use here you want some good UI to test it out? Uh you can use something called swagger. Now in other frameworks basically you have to add a swagger with fast API you get this by default. So what you do is you use the same URL but not products. Remove that. So you say localhost colon 8000 and then you say slash docs enter and you got your docs. This is swagger. Okay. And now if you click on greet because we have created two endpoints if you remember we got the endpoint if you go back to main we got this endpoint which is for the homepage and we got the endpoint which is / products and here we got the first now how do you use it if you're not if you are using this for the first time click here uh there will be an option of try it out click here and then there will be option of execute but before executing make sure that if it is asking for any parameter or not in this at this point we don't have any parameters you can click execute And this will respond here. So it says welcome to the list track. Uh scroll down. We got another one which is all products. Expand this. Scroll. And you can say right out execute and it will give you all the products here. Right? Also it returns if you observe it returns a code 200. Again we have not talked about that here but we'll see. Remember this point the code 200. Uh just to give you a hint there are multiple codes available. If something goes wrong on the uh with these resources uh or the file is not found or something you will get 404. You might have seen that everywhere right? So that's a part of the status code. Okay. So this is how you basically fetch all the data. What if you want to fetch one product? What if you want to add a product? Uh let's see that in the next"

But again, we'll not be writing a lot of code in this particular video because we have to also understand some theory part before we go ahead. But we'll start with coding and then we'll get into theory. So what I'm going to do is we got these two things here that perfectly works. Let me create a Python file and let's name this as main. py. So what exactly I'm trying to do here. So let's say whenever a user visits the website of of course we are not buying any domain here but we'll run this project in the local okay and the way you can access that is by saying local host colon so instead of 3,000 let's go for 8,000 what are these things here now if you are new to web development this local host see whenever you talk about any website or any web application you have to deploy it somewhere right so maybe you are deploying on some server maybe provided by Amazon so what you do is you deploy your application there and it is running on the server. Now if if you want to access it you have to use the IP address because every server will have their own IP address and since we don't want to remember the IP address instead of that we use domain names right so whenever you go to any website like when you go to NodeJS this is their website domain if you go to fast this is a website domain in the same way if you want to access particular website you have to provide a domain name now since we don't have a domain I'm running on my own machine so I can use the IP address now since We want the IP address of the same machine. I can use local hosted. Next, in your machine, you can run multiple services, multiple server services. And how how will you differentiate between these services and that's where we can use something called a port number. Example, when I was running a react, react was running on port number 30,000. The fast API will be running on uicon server and by default the port number will be 8,000. So when I say enter, it says the site cannot be reached. Why is because our server is not running. So what we can do is we can run the server. But before we run the server, we need to return something right. So let's say the server is running and you want to show some output here. So when you go to this homepage, it should return let's say welcome to Talis track something like that. Now in order to achieve that what you can do is you can create a function because in Python when you want to achieve something you create a function but again it is giving you some some suggestions. I don't want to use the co-pilot suggestion. So I will just nose it for some time now and okay so let's create a function. So I will say defaf and the job of this particular function is to greet the user. So I can say greet okay simple function and I'm going to print welcome to the list go track. Okay simple stuff nothing fancy I want to print this. Okay now there are two problems here and I will tell you those problems in some time. So I will just save this. Now question arise how will you run this? Now of course you can write this is your python file. You can simply say python main python space main. py and this will this should be able to print. It's just that we are uh running it but we are not calling it. Okay. So we have to call the grid function. Okay. So let's call this and run and you can see it is printing on the console. But we don't want to print on the console right? We want to print on the web page. Now in that case I don't have to call it here. It should be called through the web page. So whenever I refresh this page or go to this homepage, it should call that particular function and it should return this welcome to the list track. So that means we we not supposed to print it. We are supposed to return it to whoever is calling it. So printing is not an idea. We have to return this. Okay, that solves one problem. And once we save it, let's go back run. Uh it will still not work. Reason the server is not running. Okay, even if you have the code that the server is not running. Now how will you run the server? Of course you will not be using Python because Python is for the console based. This is where we have to use a web server. Now one of the web server we have already installed is ubicon if you remember. So we can use uicon here and we can run it. So I can simply say uicon. Then we have to provide the file name and then we have to specify hyphen reload. Okay. Now let me try to run this and let's see what you get. Okay. It says it is trying to will watch the changes in the directory because reload means the moment you say save it will just reload. Uh uon running on server this. Okay. You can see the port the address here. Now 127.0.0 is your own machine and then 8,000 is a port number. But here somewhere here it says error loading the ASGI app which is yours web server. Import string main must be in a format. Okay. So it needs a format. If you can see this is the format it is expecting here. So it's module and attribute. So we are specifying the module here which is main. This is your module because that's what you're creating here. But something is missing. Some attribute is missing. Uh okay let's go step by step. Now what is missing is we are using a web framework which is uh fast API and nowhere we have mentioned that we're using fast API. So we need to create the object of fast API and let's say the object name is app equal to and fast API we can simply use fast API here and create the object for fast API but then this is not happy it says uh fast API is not defined okay why it's not defined is because it is defined it's just that we have to import it so I will say import fast API um no I have to import fast API but this will be coming from fast API library. Yeah. So from fast API import fast API. Okay. And then you can create the object. So this fast API is a library. This is your class. I hope we can see the documentation. Yes. So you can see this is a class. Cool. Uh and then we can create the object. And now since we have the object here when I run this now so I will just I can say Ctrl C to stop the server and come back to the main screen. And now when I run this I have to pass main colon app. So you have to also mention the object name. Cool. Now it should work. Enter. The server is running. Congratulations. We can have a round of applause. Something is working after a very long time. And now it is running on the server. That's cool. So when I go to this particular page, in fact the same page we are doing here. And now if I hit this again. Oh, okay. We got some output. Server is running. But it says not found. Okay. So there were two problems before. First the server was not running. Second we were not getting whatever we want to print. Uh but at least one problem is solved. The server is running but we're not able to print. So let's solve that. And before we understand that let's move towards something called rest API. See before we move into REST API we got a client and we got a server. Now what's the job of a server is to give services right? Now this can be a file server. This can be a web server. This can be some other server. Now when you say it's a file server, the job here is to give files to whoever who is asking for this file. So let's say if there's a client A and says hey I want that file. It will go to the the request goes to the server. File server says okay let me search for the file and yeah I got the file. This is your file. That's how the file server works and it uses its own protocol to do that. There's something called FTP or SFTP if you want to secure it. uh on the other hand for the web server what's the job of a web server to give the data to the user now normally this data can be in the format of HTML or it can be format of JSON now why HTML is because in the real world we all use web pages right so when you go to Google when you go to any website like Amazon you when you go there you see the Amazon page right you see all the products now you are able to see that beautiful page is because of the HTML and CSS and JavaScript. Now all these things coming to the client side from the server. So when a client says hey give me amazon.com the amazon.com says okay these are the files take it and view on the browser. So that works right but the problem is when you create this type of application because see one application needs multiple things. There are multiple layers here. User normally uses front end but the data is stored in the database. So we got the front end and we got database. So they're two apart two things apart. Now user is concerned about the data. So of course user wants the data that is coming from the database. So don't you think the front end should be able to interact with the back end directly or with the database directly. Uh we can't do that. First of all, there are multiple issues. One is is not secure directly accessing database. Second uh you will get data in normal text. We want something good. And the third problem is to access the database we have to use SQL if it is if it is a relational database. And that's why what you do is in fact there are fourth problem also sometime you don't want data directly what you want is processed data something you have worked on something you have applied filter on or maybe combining multiple things your calculations and some data in this case what you do is you add one component in between which is your back end so we got a front end we got a datab database and now we have the back end in between now backend will be written in any language it can be Python Java JavaScript doesn't matter right So that's a back end which we build. So the request goes from the front end to the back end. Then back end does the processing of it and applying logic to it. Fetching data from database if when required and then sending the response to the client or the front end. Now this can be in two format. one from the back end side. You can create those beautiful pages and send it to the client side or you can send the front end without the data just the layout just the layout and then you can populate those data later example let's say if your internet is off and you are so let's say on your phone you don't have the internet you don't have your mobile connection as well but still when you open Instagram you can see the layout there right what is missing is the data you can't see the image you can't see the text but layout is there is because the layout is fixed. Now what is coming from the server is only the data. Now in which format you will get this data? The format is JSON. Way back we used to use XML but it is bulky and lot of issues. Now JSON is a perfect format where you can get the data in a structure format and it will be less bulky easy to understand and you will see some JSON data if you have not seen that before. So this is the communication. Now we started with rest and now it's time to talk about rest. Now when you send this data the data has to be in a proper format and that's where we got this term called rest which is representational state transfer. See whenever a client sends a request for the data you are sending the state. State means current data or current state of the data. So you're sending the state from the server side to the client side or vice versa. You're sending from data from client side to server side. So you're sending a state. Next you need to send the state in a representational format. It should be easy to represent and you are transferring it and that's why we got this term which is representational state transfer rest. So in order for a client to reach to the server of course server simply not accept all the request. Uh what if you are building a website for the e-commerce and this and the client says hey I want to look for job here. The server can't do that now because server says okay I was good with uh products but now you're asking for a job. I can't do that. So as a server it has to open some endpoints. Okay, these are the endpoints. You you can you can b browse the products, you can buy the product, you can do the payments. So those are the endpoints which we have and to build these endpoints we we use something called APIs which is application programming interface. So in order to access the server, we have to access their APIs. So if you're a server and if you want client to access you, you have to build those APIs. Okay? So if you want this server or if you want this client to get the data from you, by the way, this is JSON. Okay? So if you want your client to get data uh from the server, so client has to request and the server has to accept it. Now question arise, how will you accept it? Now if you go towards something called CRUD which is create, read, update and delete. These are the CRUD operations right now for this operations we got this amazing protocol for the website which is HTTP or web applications. So whenever we use internet we always use HTTP. So if you check here not here let's say if you go to this page HTTP yes there's also S there for security but the general protocol is HTTP. Now HTTP HTTP says I will give you certain methods to work with. Now this methods will help you for the current operations. So you got get for reading, you got post for create, you got put for update and you got delete for delete. In fact, there are more methods which you can use but these are standard uh I mean mostly used. Okay. Now after all this theory, let's come back here and let's say greet. Now whenever send someone is sending the request to the server we have to understand that for the homepage I want to return this and to do that we have to use decorators and we have to say app dot now this will have because app is fast API itself it has something called methods now there are multiple methods here uh we can use get we can use post somewhere here there should be post put patch uh there should be delete as well somewhere up yeah delete so we got all these methods I'm going to use get here because we are getting data. So whenever you want to read something from the server we say get and we have to also specify the root the path. Okay. So I'm accessing the homepage here. So if you see I'm trying to access the homepage and to do that I can say slash again. What are the other options? We'll see later. But we have this option here which is slash. And I think it should work now. So if you do this the moment you save you can see it is reloading the server. That's what we wanted. Go back to the homepage and refresh. You got it. You can see that it says welcome to the list track. And finally after talking so long, we are able to get something on the screen. And the code is so simple, right? I mean look at the things which we have done. Just do the setup once you get all the libraries and this much of code and your server is up and running with welcome to the disco track. But who want to use this? We want something advanced. Uh let's see that in the next"

In fact this is not exactly a second batch we have done DevOps before but then AI powered is second time. Okay. Now this course is a live course not the recorded one but yes there are certain modules which will be recorded but the main thing will be live and this will be a four months course and this will be happening in the weekdays from mon Monday to Thursday and yes we'll be having three days for practicing and of course for relaxation. Now the timing is 9:00 p.m. to 10:30 p.m. IST. Remember that point and this course has a lot of things in it. Now if you go down let's talk about the authors there are two trainers here. Coming to the authors or coming to the instructors we have two trainers. Our lead trainer is Hrabas and he's amazing trainer. You will get to know once you attend the session and of course if you are still confused you can enroll for the course and you can ask for the refund in 7 days and if you are enrolling now you can check the refund date below. Okay. So there are a lot of things to cover in this course and in fact it will take me a lot of time to actually go through the content and I'll get tired. So I got Heather here to explain all the things. So we'll make sure that you understand the tools and can work on it in DevOps. Okay. Now when we say you we will be doing AI powered stuff here. So of course in the world of AI we need to do that. So it's not just about mastering DevOps it's also about how do you use AI while working in this environment. Okay. So just to reiterate these are the details which we have date, months and the days on which you'll be having and this will be an online live interaction sessions. Uh but yes there are certain modules which we which you will get in recording so that if you get extra time you can watch those videos and master it and this is where the course content start but I would ask Heather to come on board and explain these things. Hello everyone, my name is Heather Abbas, one of the instructor for this course and let me give you a brief idea, a road map of this course. What is ahead of you to start with there are no prerequisite for this course. We are going to start everything from absolute scratch. How exactly is the road map is what we may have to see here. Now, initially one week we'll be spending on generic fundamentals for anyone to get into IT industry. What are the important terminologies or what are the things you must know is what we'll be focusing on. For an example, what is agile? What is scrum? What is software development life cycle? How exactly softwares are built? All the fundamentals which is required to align everyone on the same track. Whether you are a fresher, university student or maybe you are a working professional with some experience and want to understand DevOps. This is for everyone. The major topics which we are going to understand here is uh first Linux and shell scripting. The most important here for anyone who want to get into the world of DevOps and cloud Linux plays very important role and so is the shell scripting. So we'll be spending nearly 3 to four weeks of time on Linux and shell scripting because the most important model after which we are going to start with AWS followed by git and github maven tomcat then terraform anible docker kubernetes genkins sonar cube these are the major tools which we are going to understand. So as we have discussed initially we'll be focusing on the fundamentals then followed by the Linux and shell scripting and once we are done with this we are going to start with AWS. This entire course we'll be doing with AWS cloud. You can choose any other cloud also but in this course we'll be focusing on AWS. Now coming to this AWS we'll not be focusing on any of the certification. This will be AWS crash course wherein we'll focus on generic the real time uh use of the AWS or for a DevOps engineer whatever is required the concept which you can see here all the major parts which you should be knowing it okay and once we are done with the cloud computing with AWS we are going to start with the actual DevOps tool you'll be getting the recorded videos on Maven Git and GitHub Terraform Anible we could have done that live also as it has already been told that this is not the very first batch we have seen in the last two batches the time will be more than 4 months if we try to do these things in the live class because the content is huge right so we'll be giving you Maven GitHub Terraform anible in the recorded format we will guide you when to watch uh when you have to start watching that we'll be uploading this content and if you stuck there somewhere we will be there to guide you you and ask the doubts in the live sessions on the topics which we have covered in the recorded videos right and after the AWS actually it is the docker which we are going to start in the live class before that we'll be uploading these videos maybe during the AWS or at the end of AWS classes and then we are going to start with the docker we are going to spend good amount of time on docker and then we are going to start with the kubernetes the most important module for anyone to know if you are into the world of DevOps right and once we are done with the Kubernetes we are going to start with the genkins CI/CD with genkins followed by the sonar cube and we'll be building some projects we will have pipelines automated CI/CD pipelines we'll be focusing on them once we are done with genkins so in the live classes we'll focus on fundamentals in the week one then we'll focus on Linux and bashell scripting followed by AWS crash course and then docker Kubernetes genkins very good amount of time we are going to spend on this alongside the projects right by the end of four months we'll be covering all the tools which we have specified here majorly focusing on docker kubernetes and genkins and also as we have mentioned it is AI powered every stage we are going to use AI here we are going to use all the tools in order to generate the playbooks in order to generate the uh scripts shell script or it could be maybe the terraform script or anible playbook and also for the debugging troubleshooting and IDE integrated uh AI tools also we are going to see followed by interview question discussion with the help of AI tools we'll see how we can use AI tools for the rum building and for the troubleshooting and also to enhance the productivity as a DevOps engineer which is very very important. Hence we call this as AI powered DevOps with AWS. Right now this entire DevOps will be on AWS. If you want to learn some other cloud definitely if you have an idea about one cloud provider you can easily learn the other. Right? We'll be focusing on DevOps on AWS. And once you learn this if you want you can do the DevOps with some other cloud providers of your own choice. That should not be a matter of concern. I hope you got the uh picture and after every live class you will be having the doubt session just in case if you have anything to discuss with the instructors with the mentors after the class once the discussion live class technical discussion is over you can interact with us and get your doubts resolved right so this is well organized and well structured course 3 days or 4 days of time will be given on the live classes and 3 days of time you'll have for you to practice Because DevOps is not just about learning. DevOps is about implementing implementing the DevOps culture. Right? So we are very excited for this course. I hope you all too. See you inside the"

Of course, site in your machine need to have those things. So let's go step by step. The first thing you have to check is open your terminal. Now based on which OS you're using and I mean we call terminal everywhere now. So cmd terminal whatever you prefer. Open that and check do you have python installed. So how do you check? It's very simple. You say Python - version and if you see a version there that means Python is there. Now I have tested with two different versions 3.12 and 3.13 it works. If you have a previous version I would recommend you to upgrade. Otherwise if you have a lower version try it out. If something is not working just upgrade. Okay that's one. Next if you want to use the front end see whatever front end we saw in the previous video. It's not compulsion that you can run that application with that front end. It's optional. We have another way of accessing those pages. We can use Postman like your REST client. Uh we can also use insomnia. You can use swagger. And by default, fast API gives you docs in the format of swagger. So you can use that but front end looks good. You will get that satisfaction. Yeah, you have done something. That's the only reason we have that front end. But in case if you want to run front end, uh you need to make sure that you have NodeJS installed. And I have tested with version 22. Make sure that you have upper version than this. Uh I have not updated my node from a long time. In case if you don't have this two softwares and I'm assuming you have Python because this is the advanced part of Python. So you should you need to have that. I will not show you Python. Let's get towards NodeJS. And this is this is where you can click on download and there should be option of this. This is the latest version. You can go with LTS version. You can also go with the current version and that should work. Now once you have uh these two let's see what else we need. So you need these two done verified. Next now you need an ID. So in my machine I got VS code and I already have VS code open in one of the screen. Let me just drag it here. This is how it will look like. I will just increase the font size. And this is where we'll be doing all the work. So make sure that you have Python, you got NodeJS. Again, NodeJ is optional if you don't want to use the UI. Uh, then you need VS code or PyCharm or whatever ID you prefer. Uh, next in your VS code, you need to have Python extension installed. And again, I'm assuming that you have worked on Python before. It's just that if you have not worked on Python on VS code, uh, you need to make sure that you have this extension. So, micro Python from Microsoft. Okay. Next before we do any more configuration in VS code now this section or this small part is only for those people who want to run the UI. Now in that case instead of taking a lot of trouble what you can do is in fact I would recommend you to do this. So on GitHub you have this particular folder called front end in the project. Okay. So this is our project and in this we got multiple branches. If you can see, we got product with UI, product with DB, product put, delete, and post. So, this is our first repository which we're going to start with. Again, I'm going to type everything except the front end part. But if you jump to the last branch with products with UI, this is what you need to download. Okay? Uh, of course, you will get everything. But this is where this is important for us. Now, how do you download? It's very simple. You can simply click here and click on download. Now why I would I'm recommending download instead of this uh cloning is when you clone you will get the entire project. Okay. And when you open you will get again you will get all these files. When you download what will happen is you will get everything a zip file. Unzip it and then delete the extra folders or the extra files here. You are only concerned about front end. Okay. Just keep it there. Again when you clone it you can also delete all the other files but it is easier to download from the file explorer or the whatever you call these days now what it is called yeah file explorer so you can delete from there so download it unzip it and get this folder this folder is important if you want to run the UI and I'm going to do the same thing so I'm just going to download this and I should have shown the steps you know simple so open unzip done this is where you got your folder uh open this you got only one branch which is fast API demo products with UI and out of this you need just this one folder apart from this you don't need any any of the things you can just simply copy this and let's create a folder for us I will do that in the C drive and let me make a new folder and I will say fast API demo recording because I'm I'm using it for recording so I will use that because after some time after few weeks I will look at this project and I I will not realize why I have created this project. So let me just create that folder in the C drive and put your front end there. Simple stuff. Uh now once you have these steps ready, what you can do is go to your VS code and open the folder. So C drive fast API demo recording and open this folder. Not the front end. Open the fast API demo recording folder. And yeah, you got it. Just say trust and you are in. Now once you got this project, this is where your front end is and you can run the front end as it is. Uh in fact I should be showing that now as well. So let me do that. So I will just go back here. Go to your terminal and in the terminal move to front end. So make sure that you're in the front end folder and if you have never worked on React before this is a React project. Let me show you some certain things. So this is the main package.json. This this is where you handle the dependencies. You write the script when to run, when not to run, how to stop, how to debug and all the stuff. Now to run this basically you can simply say npm install. Now we're not running it. We are installing the dependencies. So whatever dependencies needed for this project because see if you open this package or JSON one of the dependency is React itself. So React is a library. So you have to get that. Now once you get this uh dependencies you have to say npm installed so that it will download all the dependencies. And how do you know if you have dependencies downloaded or not? In the front end folder, you will you will see one more folder called nodes modules. And you can you can only see that when you have your dependencies downloaded. So we we can't see that now. When I once I click on npm install, it will download the dependencies for you. And you can see it is doing it fast. And this is the folder I'm talking about. And as you can see, we got this uh downloaded. And those things are in this node modules. And now it's time to run the node or the react project. So I will say npm start. Now how do you know it is start? If you come down there's a script called start. This is what you have to enter. And this will start the project. Okay. It says something is already running because I think my older project is still running. I will just close it now. No, I don't want to use another port. Let's do that again. And now it should start. Okay. So it is opening now. And this is your project. Now it says failed to fetch is because the back end is not working. Uh that pop-up came and went because I've set the timer for 5 seconds. But no products and nothing will work. Okay. Even if you add products, it will not work because the back end is not connected. In fact, you you can also check because this is what you're going to do later. Uh you can go to console and you can see it will say something is blocked or the server okay server is not server is still running on the other project. My bad. Now let's try refresh. Yeah this is what I was expecting. I was not expecting cause error. So it says error connecting or connection refused. There's nothing on the back end. Cool. So let's make this work. But what other setup we need? So let's go back here and close this. This is the front end part. The next thing we need in this particular setup is the fast API itself. So what you will do is you'll open a new terminal here and let's install the fast API. In fact, we need two things. One, the fast API itself because that's a framework we're going to use. The second thing we need here is a web server because we are building a web application. REST API is also a web application and this web application runs on a server. You need to you need to get that. So if you have worked on Java before, if you want to have a web server there, we got Tomcat. For Node, for React or NodeJS, we got Node itself. Uh for PHP, we got ZAM server. So for every particular language, we got some servers. Here we have to get the web server and which is called UION. I know unique name instead of unicorn that went for uon. Good. Um so what I will do is I will get the uicon. But before that I will in in fact whenever you want to install some packages we use something called pip right but we have a problem here. If I install let's say if I install fast API here. So I will say pip install uh fast API is that simple just write a command it will install. The problem is this will install fast API for all my Python projects. So maybe I'm working on AI as in some other project or maybe I'm working on uh consolebased application in some project. The moment I say pip install fast API, it will install fast API globally for all the projects. We don't want it. We want fast API only for this project. Now how do you isolate? So basically in different uh languages they have different ways of doing it. In Python normally what you do is if you want to have some packages specific to one project you create something called a environment your own environment or maybe we can call it as a virtual environment. So here we want to create a virtual environment. So how do we do it? It's very simple. You say python - m and then you specify what you want to create. I want to create a virtual environment. So v env that's what it's called virtual environment. And you have to give a name to it. You can give any name. Maybe you can say fast api project if you want. Uh I will simply say my environment because I want to keep it unique. Uh so my environment. Okay. Now the moment you do that it will create an environment which will take some time. Okay. Okay. So you can see it is still not doing anything because things are happening behind the scene. And this is what you got. You need to get this folder. If you don't have this folder, something is wrong with the comment or the the command here. And in this you got all your environment set up ready. And by default you will get these two. But we want more. So what we you will do is you will say pip. Okay. Now you have to activate it first. Now how do we activate? So to activate based on what you're using, if you're using PowerShell or a command prompt, you need to use different script. So this is these are the scripts for PowerShell. This is a script. For command prompt, this is a script. So for PowerShell, just copy the path. I hope this will work. Just going for the absolute path. Let me try. Yeah, it worked. So instead of typing, normally you just have to type this much. But absolute path works. Then why to worry? In fact, you should be copying the relative path. Yeah, this is what I was expecting. But no problem we are able to run this script and that's important. Now how do you know it is successful? It has created the environment. If you see before your path you should be getting this your environment name. So your uh environment is activated. Now how do you deactivate? It's very simple. You simply say deactivate with the right spelling and now you're out. So this is how you do it. So if you want to get in activate. If you want to go out deactivate. Now let me show you what's the difference of I mean what how it helps. So if I say pip list it will show all the packages installed this in this machine and if you scroll down this it's a huge list for different project we got different libraries I just keep adding them and now okay if I activate again and now let's check you should be able to see only one right but then I want two more so the what are two more so you have to say pip install you need to get fast API and we need one more which is web server which Uicon. So you will say not unicorn Ubicon and done. When you say run this code I mean run this command not code it will download those things for you which will take some time and yeah so you can see we got all the packages here. So we have dependencies dependencies right? So there are some dependencies where which dependencies are dependent on uh so it will get that as well. In fact if you want to check you can do that uh pay list and it will give you everything now. So you got fast API, you got ubicon and we are happy. That's the setup you need and I'm tired doing the setup here. So these two things and fast API Ubicon you need then you can start with the code. Now how do we do that code? Let's see in the next"

My name is Ain Reddi and let's talk about fast API. So when you work with Python, you can do multiple things with Python. You can use Python to build consolebased application. You can use it for GUI building. You can use it for web framework. You can use it for AI and of course for different things. We got different libraries, different frameworks. But now we are talking about fast API which is a web framework for Python. And this is not the first option. We have multiple frameworks available for Python. We got Django, Flask and now we got fast API. In fact, we already have a Django series which was created 5 to 6 years ago and now I should have gone for Flask and then fast API. In fact, fast API was never in the option. I wanted to explore flask but then I looked at fast API and thought I thought hey that's simple uh easy to go with and it works. And the most important thing is it has this amazing features which we're going to talk about now. So let's head towards the homepage of fast API. Now before we talk about fast API, I want to show you the project which we're going to build to start with. Okay. And maybe later on we'll update this project mode. We'll add more features based on what fast API has to offer. Okay. Now this is a simple page because I wanted to explore C operation and this is what we are going to build. Now hold on. Using Python and using fast API we can build the back end and you are looking at the front end. Now the front end is actually in react and no we are not going to learn react in this course. This imagine this page or this front end is already created. Now to make it work you have to build a backend for it. Okay example if you talk about this things whatever you are doing here this data is coming from the back end. So the database which we're going to use is posgress but you can use whatever you want. The back end we are going to use Python and the framework is fast API and the front end is in react. So we are going to skip the React part. You will get the code as it is the entire react application. You just have to build a back end and run it will work. I mean it should work uh based on your configuration. Now what we're trying to build here is this is a simple inventory application. Nothing very fancy and I don't want to launch my own startup for this uh simple application. Right now in this we got products here and which in which you can see we got list of products and then uh I have an option of sorting this of course this is of react part nothing to do with the back end but what is there in the back end this data is coming from the back end and you can edit this data you can see if you click on edit it is changing here again the part of front end but the actual saving or updating of data is happening in the back end uh I can add a new product here I can just simply say refresh okay now this is something this is the first time I'm looking at this bug not a bug but then how will you go to add now okay I should have done that before okay so refresh the page there's something I need to update in the front end as well anyway the point is let's say if you if you got this front end I want to add the ID which is let's say five and I want to say let's say asus laptop description budget laptop price is let's say 999 uh and then quantity is let's say we got 12 quantity and add and you can see it has got added which is which is here now This is the entire front end. You can search for the product. Example, if you say a laptop, it will show you the laptops, right? Again, this is a front- end functionality of searching. But then uh when you search something, okay, this is filtering. We should not be using that. Maybe I should be doing that with the help of ID. So if I say three, you can say there's three. So this is basically can be done through the back end as well. Uh what else you can do? You can delete the items. So this is the back end feature. So if I click on delete pen because I don't want cheap products in the inventory. I'm just kidding. Pen is very important. Uh and you can see it is got it got deleted. Okay, simple stuff. Now I want to show you the back end for this. And this is the entire code repository which I'm going to share with you. So there's a front end folder which you can see here and the back end is this files. Uh not the perfectly optimized code for the production but we are not doing for the production now. We are basically learning a framework right. So this should make sense. And now let's head towards the homepage of fast API. And this is it. This is fast API. And they are claiming it's a fast API framework. It's high performance, easy to learn, fast to code and ready for production. Uh out of this I have tested for easy to learn, fast to code and ready for production. I have not tested for the high performance. But if they are claiming it and a lot of people are using it, so it should be okay. Now if you want to read documentation, you can read it from here and that's the homepage. You can just look at for the documentations here. and fast API is modern fast performance. Again, I have not tested it, but it's very easy to work with and you will see that when when we do that. Okay, so very very high performance on par with NodeJS and go. Okay, that's what they are promising. Uh faster code we have seen this few bugs and okay other thing looks good. Now this is what fast API is promising. So fast API is basically a web framework and we are going to do this step by step. So the first thing we need to do is in fact there are some prerequisites. Uh you need to know Python. Of course we are not going to teach you Python in this course. So you should know Python. You need to basically understand how basically a web framework works. And in in fact I'm going to give you a glimpse uh what happens when you communicate from a client side or whenever you access a particular website how it works. But having that knowledge prior to it will be helpful. But don't worry I will talk about it as well. And uh that's it. You don't you need just two things. uh in terms of softwares to do this you need to have Python installed in your machine and a editor now or ID to be specific. Now you can use uh IDE like PyCharm for Python or you can use VS code or any other ID which you like. We are going to use VS code here because for PyCharm uh it will be bulky and not everyone will be having it and people are getting used to VS code. So let's use VS code in this course and maybe in between I will show you how do we run this in PyCharm. Okay, let's that's a separate thing but initially we'll start with VS code and there are certain things which we have to install and stuff. Yeah, initially there will be learning curve but once you get used to it it's very easy. Okay, cool. So that's about the introduction for fast API. Apart from this uh make sure whenever you watch the upcoming videos don't just watch the videos practice them because practicing is very important otherwise it's of no use. and uh go through the documentation you know in case if I miss something just go through the documentation and you'll be good. In fact I wanted to add one disclaimer the UI which you are seeing here is it's created by AI okay so if you find any glitch here you can blame the AI if you love it I did it I I did those prompts with the AI so cool uh so I hope you'll enjoy this series and see you in the next video. Bye-bye."

So when I say you, I'm talking about developers. What you do is you write a code and you mention everything what should happen when right when there should be a button when there should be a text field when uh something should move from one place to the place. Now here instead of you mentioning all the logic AI can take over and it will do the stuff for you. So the goal here is to achieve AI right? So that's a goal. If AI is a goal then let's go for the method using which you can do it. So there are multiple ways of implementing AI. Uh one of the famous way is machine learning. So you can imagine AI as a big circle. So we are going for the vend diagram again. So AI is a big circle and then inside that big circle we got another circle which is for machine learning. Now machine learning is a method. Okay. Now how do we do it? It's very simple. You ask your machine to learn okay I mean of course you are learning machine learning but machine need to learn how to implement AI that's a funny stuff but machine need to learn how to do that okay and the the way you do that is by training it so you pass huge amount of data of course first you have to build a model which has the capacity of learning things okay and if you can do that that's comes under machine learning so if AI is a goal machine learning is the method or the way to do it. But what about the tools? Of course to do something you you need to work on tools and that's where deep learning comes into picture. So if AI is a big big circle inside that we got machine learning and inside machine learning we got deep learning. Now what it means is there are multiple ways of implementing AI. Machine learning is one of them. There are multiple ways of doing machine learning. Deep learning is one of them. Now why we are focusing only on the deep learning is because the models which we are going to use those are LLM models and they use deep learning. So it makes sense to talk about it. Now why this word deep is it learning much deeper than machine learning? That's what I used to think when I started with this but no that depends. So deep word here came because of neural networks. Now before we talk about deep learning let's talk about neural network. In fact, we have talked about deep learning that's a part of machine learning and the word deep it got from neural network. Now AI always try to mimic humans how we think how we work everything. In fact robotic they want to make it as human shape because ultimately it will be used by humans. Now the way our brain works so we got all these neurons in our mind. uh whenever you want to take a decision. So in your mind you have learned so many things in this years whatever your age is and uh from where you got the majority but uh you have learned a lot of things in your life. Now whenever you want to take a decisions of it can be a small decisions of what to eat now and the biggest decision of your life what career to choose who should you get married and all those stuff. So you take that decision based on the input right. So you got all these neurons connected and you give it some input maybe through visuals or through audio for by touch and based on that input it processes the input and different neurons talk to each other and ultimately you get one response. Those are for people who are clear in their life. People like me who are always confused we still use coin toss to decide what to do. So the idea is you'll be having multiple inputs or maybe one input or multiple input and you'll be having one output. Now this is what they copied in neural network. What we have is we got different layers here and depend upon the number of layers we got this name. Uh so when you have one input layer one output layer that is fixed in between you'll be having multiple layers. If you got few layers let's say one or two we call it as a shallow learning and if you got more layers in between we call it as a deep learning. So now you know in deep learning you'll be having multiple layers. Now what these layers do? So the first layer which is input layer will take an input and the last layer output layer will give you the output. So example let's say if you want to find if that image of fruit is it apple or banana or something else. So what you do is you give the image to the first model which the first layer which is input layer. Now this input layer will take the image maybe just uh find the pixels and get the detail about the image. Now this data will be passed to the next layer. Now imagine all these layers they are actually neurons but imagine all these uh boxes there or circles there are humans. Now based on the image they will try to guess okay that image looks like round uh so it should be lemon or it should be apple or it should be uh what else we have round maybe pier. So basically you get all these suggestions from all these neurons based on this shape. Then someone some particular person will guess okay now that's uh red color so it should be apple. Now all these inputs so in fact all these outputs from this first layer will go to the next layer and then go to the next layer and ultimately let's say the last the output layer is a decision maker by saying okay we got uh apple I mean we got lemon that's the output and then as a as a user or as a trainer of neural network you will say okay no that was apple you guessed it lemon that's wrong now when you build this models for the first time or neural network basically they will always go for random stuff. It will give you uh wrong output and this is where you have to train. You have to say okay no that was apple not lemon. Now they will just backtrack. They will say okay someone made a mistake here. So they will track each layer by saying okay you suggested lemon so I have to give you less weightage now. Okay now that's a word weight. Okay so we have to use weights as a word or maybe you can imagine the knob. So this particular person you will get the less weightage or less importance. Now this importance goes from minus1 to + one. Uh that's the range. Now when you say minus one so if a person gets minus one that means whatever that person says always think reverse. If the person says it's white it's black. Uh then if a if a person gets the weightage one highest importance. If it if the person says it is white it is white. If a person caught weightage zero or near zero, uh that's you can you can simply skip it you know doesn't matter what they say and that's how basically you take the decisions right so each neuron will give some input to the next layer and that layer will decide okay so we got input from two different neurons one got bigger weightage one got less weightage and that's how you compare now of course I'm not getting into maths of neuronet network because it will take one year to do that and we don't have that much of time and we are not even getting into machine learning right we are getting into AI engineering so you you don't need to know what mathematical stuff they are doing what is important is the terms so whenever you work with a new models or if you get stuck somewhere you want to fine-tune it you need to understand those words what they're discussing about and another word is neural network one of the word is weights so that's how we got this word right which is deep learning now the next concept you have to understand is transformers now if you heard about chat GPT or GPT in general the And the T here is transformers and it has actually transformed AI. Uh now how? So before transformers we used to use different models like one of them is RNN and whenever you give uh I mean it was not good for uh language stuff. So whenever you want to talk to the models of course the model will get the input from you. It will try to understand the context what you're talking about. So let's say if I say the cat was playing whole day and now and now it is tired. Now when you give such a big sentence of course it's small for humans but for machines with the with those models they were finding it difficult to keep attract to make the attention on each word. So the cat was playing all day done better and then it says now it is tired. So the moment it says it what that it means. So that that's that's where this models were getting confused and when transformer came into picture transformer came with something called self attention. Now transformer has this capability to understand the entire context and work with multiple words at the same time. So even if you pass a bigger prompt on your chat GPT it knows how to process it because of transformers. So GPT stands for generative pre-trained transformer. So that's the transformer we are talking about. So you can also imagine if a transformer is reading a book uh basically the models before transformer when they were reading book they were reading like humans you know so in general I'm talking about myself so when I read a book and if I'm in a mood of course I can just read continuously and I will understand but sometime you know my mind is somewhere and when I'm reading things I read the line and then when I go for the next line I forgot what was what I read in the previous line. Okay, that is what happened with the previous models like other than but with transformers they maybe they carry the highlighter with them and every time they read a book or something they just highlight the points on which they have to work on. So each word gets the uh weight or some importance and that's how they do it. So yeah once we know the basics of it now we can head towards the code and understand this in a proper"

My name is Ain Reddi and in this video we'll talk about AI engineering or we have this new role called AI engineer. So let's talk about it. See when you talk about AI and it's not something new it's there from a long time from 1950s we got certain things from 1970s we got some improvements and then every year we saw something coming but then it was all for the enterprises how they can build certain things with the help of AI and we are hearing about Google AI Watson from IBM and from different company but in 2022 this is a time when OpenAI made Jad GPD. Now this was the first time I think where AI was accessible for normal users and things started changing very fast after that point and now we are a bit scared if AI going to take over all the jobs not just for developers for writers for trainers because of the videos I don't think you need to watch my video in future there will be a AI bot teaching you okay now that's a different thing okay so let's see that in the future I'm a bit scared but that's fine the point here is as a software developer like you and me what is our role now yeah they are talking about AI is going to replace software developer they can build applications but this also gives you a power to use AI in building softwares it's not about building software the way you are doing we have to add something extra and that something extra is the AI capabilities in your existing application or the new application the way you build software is changing So AI is not just for uh PhDs or data scientists. It is for software developers as well. And we have to understand how do we do it and if you can integrate AI into your application as a software developer, you can call yourself now as a AI engineer. So your role switches from a software engineer to a AI engineer. So what is changing? See when you build application of course your idea is to solve a problem. So there's a problem in the world which you're trying to solve by building application or maybe you're creating a new problem and solving it that's a different point but the idea is to solve a problem with the help of software and the way your software works is how you define it to work. Basically when you build a software we go it in certain steps right we have something called SDLC which is uh software development life cycle. We go with different phases. uh if there's a problem you will understand the requirement then you will design it then you will code it then you will test it and then you will deploy it and maintain that's the normal process of course you can add certain things here you can remove some stages like if you are building a college project or dummy project who is doing testing right but yes if you want to do that in the enterprise level testing is very important now what happens in all the phases here in the requirement phase you get the requirement in the analysis phase you understand what is requirement is and Then you start designing the model okay not AI model basically how the software will work and you define everything what should happen when what kind of input you're going to get from the user what actions you are going to perform on that so let's say if you want to achieve certain thing you will say click this button then this will happen now based on certain condition you want to execute certain things now you have to define everything you have to also make sure that by just by clicking that button you're not launching a rocket or shutting down the system. Basically, you check everything in that design phase and then you will start implementing it in the coding phase. Now, this is what we want to change. Why as a software developer, you have to define what should be the logic. What should happen when AI can generate logic based on what it has learned. So, you are not defining the logic, it is AI, you just say what you want to achieve based on the user interactions. Now, how we are going to do this? See there are a lot of models available in the market right if you heard about GPT or Gemini or anthropic cloud basically all these are models which you can use they are not just a fun tool to have some fun now they are production ready APIs which you can use and implement in your application now question arise how will you do it now these companies or this models they also give you APIs not for free yeah you can use open source models if you want it for free or they might also provide you some free APIs to use but if you want to use them full-fledged of course you will pay for it or you will get the access anyhow but they will give you APIs now you have to integrate those APIs in your application so it is your job as a AI engineer in between to help to connect this application with the AI models and the good thing is you are 80% there is because you know how everything works you know how to build a software in fact not just into the coding phase you understand all the steps You know what our requirements are, you know what is possible, what is not possible. I don't think in the AI world anything is impossible now. But you know the limits right and then you know how a software should work, how user will interact. You also know how to code. You know one of the programming language then you know what is testing concept altogether is what is new for you is integrating those AI tools or AI models in your application. So you can think about this as AI is not replacing you. It's more about enhancing your existing capability. And with that you're not just building an application, you're building a smart or intelligent applications. So now let's go back to that SDLC. What are the things which are going to change? Uh of course the normal SDLC will remain same but you have to inject certain more steps in between. example how will you interact with the AI and thanks to chat GPT and all these models or the applications you know how to talk to AI there is something called prompt engineering there are good ways of doing it there are bad ways of doing it and we have to learn the good ways to make your application much better second is it's not just about working with one database now so of course to store your data you're going to use some database but if you want to use AI we have to add some extra concepts like embedding and vector databases and also rag. Why you will need that? So let's say you have an application which you are building for a client who is into ticket booking. So maybe flight tickets or bus tickets or train tickets. So they are into that. And now when a new user comes in now of course for a new user they have to create an account. Now how they will create an account? Yeah I know it is straightforward. You can basically uh open an open the page and there should be a option of creating an account. But let's say if they get stuck somewhere because it's ask you for extra information and now they don't know how to proceed. So of course you will provide a chatbot right and that's the default behavior. Uh nowadays you got a chatbot there and you will say okay I I don't I want to know how to create an account in this application. Now if you think about this chatbot it might be using some models behind the scene like OpenAI or cloud or whatever model you have. Now this model when you ask they will know how to create an account in general. Okay. Now when you say in general maybe they know how to get account on Google or Facebook or maybe Amazon and they will give you steps how to get account on those applications and that's where it is hallucinating right we are asking for our application which is giving the data about uh those websites. Now this is where you have to inject certain documents in your bot by saying see it's not just about interacting with the open AI. This is our company policies. This is how you create account for this particular application. So you will inject those documents in the AI or in your prompt and that's what you can do with the help of rag. So those documents goes into the database not the normal database if you're thinking it is a vector database. Now to convert that from text to to numbers which vector database support. You need to have embeddings. Now if you're not understanding all those things don't worry we'll go to them in detail later. But I just wanted to give you an idea. It's not just about using models and you you will call yourself as AI engineer. You have to do all those steps as well. Prompt engineering embedding vectors rag and also how do you deploy the application now? Because it's not just a normal application. you are interacting with the models, you are storing that data in the vector database as well. So it changes the way you do DevOps now. Uh so we should call it as LLM ops now. That sounds much better, right? So things are changing. Apart from it, you have to also fine-tune your AI model. You can't simply use OpenAI by saying it should behave the way I want. Example, let's say if I'm building my own AI tutor and if you say, hey, I want to learn Java. Maybe I want to learn uh let's say blockchain and AI tutor with the help of open AAI it will give you the entire document hey now read this but then I want the AI tutor or the model which you're using should behave like the way I teach it should teach the way I teach how will I do that and that's why I have to fine-tune my AI specifically for education specifically for the way we work okay so those things also included in AI engineering now the question is do we have to also build models? Uh not necessary because all these companies are already doing it. You don't have to build your own models. You can do that. Okay. Nobody is stopping you to build your own models. But the question is should we and yes if you are a company who want to build their own models please you know we need good models in the market competing with existing models. But let's say if you your idea is just to build your application smart, it's good to use uh the existing models. If you don't want to use the uh proprietary models, you can also use open source models. You can run it on your local hardware and you can make it work. You can you can do the configuration for that. You can change the way it works and the data will belong to you. Okay? Uh if you want to achieve that. Uh but do you need to know the basics of AI a bit? Yes, you should. you know should you understand how AI works how this model works what is neural networks basics of it will be needed and that should be enough you don't have to go in depth because when I started uh AI I started with that I started with mathematics statistics then understanding what is machine learning understanding different uh algorithms there but now when I when I'm trying to be a AI engineer now I'm not using them but yes it helps me to understand how they are doing it when the new models comes into picture. I know what is changing and that should be enough for you. And before we end this, remember one thing. It's not AI is going to replace the developers. It's the developers who are using AI are going to replace developers who are not using AI. And I want to add one more point. Now you might be thinking uh when you add all those steps in between when you use the models it is will it will cost and yes it will cost but to whom? If it is costing to you, you are going to sell the products to your customer. They will be happy, right? Because see businesses looks for values and if you can provide values, they're going to pay for it. They also need competitive advantage. So if you have a client who got competition in the market and if they have AI, of course, they're ready to pay for it and ultimately they can keep their customers happy by customizing it as per their needs. So yeah, that's all about AI engineering and uh the plan is to create the series on it. Let me know your thoughts in the comments and uh if you're excited, let me know so that I will get motivated and I will start the series soon. Thank you so much for watching. See you in the next part."
