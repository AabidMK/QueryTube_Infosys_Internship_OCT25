Cf1-R6c0P3c,"First of all, thanks for being here in my YouTube channel. So friends, before watching this video, so do not forget to purchase my aptitude quantitative aptitude book on Amazon. In case if it is out of stock, you can directly purchase for the same price at our platform. The link is in the description. So friends, now let me move on to the 33rd data interpretation for the mains exam. So here it's based on a table chart, right? So table chart under that they have given five question. So friends again kindly take the test right. So the same question same value everything is same. So first write the test understand your mistake where you are struggling to solve it or after which point you can't able to proceed to solve the remaining step of the question analyze yourself right by writing the test and then come and watch this video. The solution is already given in the test series. In case if you can't even understand the solution, come and watch this video. Definitely it will be helpful without writing the test by just watching this video and you are learning no use for the mains exam. Right? So first write the test. So now let me move on to this question here. So there are how many shopkeepers five stationary shops are there? So PQ, RST and they are selling three different different stationary item. So the sold pen value is directly given. For example, shop stationary shop P where the number of sold pen is 300. The remaining two values are given in terms of percentages, right? And some of the values are missing here. So, so once you take for example, if you take the second shop, shop Q, right? So, the number of uh sold pen was missing that value is missing. But the remaining two percentage is what? 25%age and 35%age. That means uh the notebook sold and the sold pencil which is equals to 60%age. Then the remaining 40%age will be the total number of sold pen. So friends understood or not? Always remember that the total should be 100%. If 2%age value has been given 25 percentage and 35%age I'm talking about the stationary shop Q second value right? So 25 percentage and 35 percentage has been given. One value is missing. That means the remaining percentage should be the first value. So 25 35 will be 60%age. So the remaining first value should be 40%age. That 40%age value is missing. So similarly most of the values are missing here on every stationary shop one one value is missing. So let me move on to the question so that based on the question we can try to solve all the remaining values. Right? So very interesting. So first question if the total pen sold by shop Q is 33 1x3 percentage less than the total pens sold by shopp. So how much less 33 1x3 I have told many times 62.5 33.14.28 28. So these are the fraction. You should know it's a decimal point percentage value. For the decimal point percentage value, you should by add some of the fraction terms. If it is 33 1x3 percentage, the fraction of this number is 1x3, right? So 33 1x3 percentage means 33.33%. So if you convert the percentage value into a fraction, the resultant will be 1x3. So the meaning here is that if the total pen sold from shop Q that value is missing in the chart. So that value is 1x3 less than the total pen sold by the shopppee. So if it is 1x3 less that means the remaining 2x3 from shopppee. So shopppee is how much? The total pen sold by shopppee is 300. Out of this 300 find what is 2x3 because it is 1x3 less right. So Q sold the pen which is 1x3 less than P. So better instead of finding 1x3 and then subtracting it directly you can find what is 2x3. Yes or no if I'm if I'm having 20% less than you then better if we can find out of the amount what you have 80% will be the amount what I have right so similarly 2x3 so 1x3 less better we can find what is 2x3 of the pencil sold from uh uh stationary shop P. So you can cancel it. Resultant will be 100. So P is equals to 100. That means 100 into 2 resultant will be 200. That means 200 will be the total pen that was sold by the shop stationary shop Q. Second point what they said is okay. So second point is and the total pencil sold by R. Okay. The total pencil which was sold by R. So R total pencil. Okay. Total pencils sold by R is how much percentage you can able to see it's a missing value right? So total R was not given right R value is not given sorry I think it's 360 right so 360 will be 120 which is 240 sorry sorry sorry sorry 240 right I didn't look at the chart value carefully so where the total pens sold is 360 2x3 which is uh 120 120 into 2 will be 240 so now according to the question what they are saying is total and the total pencil right so pencil pencil will be the last column right total pencil sold by shop R. So shop R where the total pencil value is missing so now what they saying is 90% 90 less than the sold by shop Q. So when compared to Q where the R is 90 less first let we find what is the total pencil that was sold by shop Q because shop Q we have found what is the total pen sold. So total pens sold in shop Q is 240. Right? So shop Q what is the other value they have given is 25%age. 25%age is what the total sold notebooks. So notebooks is 25%age. Right? Understood? And the last value is total number of pencil. So pencil sold is 35%age. So this is completely for the second stationary shop that is Q. Right? So from the first data we have found 240 is the total pin and in the chart itself they have given the remaining values. By using this value we can able to find what is the 100%age of the stationary item which is available from the stationary shop cube because we know 25% 35% 25% 35%age is what? 60%age. If 60%age is these two value then the remaining this will be 40%age. Yes. So if 40%age is equals to 240 then what is 100%? 100% is equal to x. So we can cancel percentage percentage here we can cancel this six times. So 6 into 100 will be 600. So finally this 600 will be the total three items that are available from the stationary shop cube that is pen, notebook and a pencil. So total value which is 600 the total stationary item that is available from the stationary shop Q. So friends understood or not? So now what they are saying is now they are talking about R. So R which is 90 less than sold by the shop Q. So we know that 35%age is the total pen pencil that was sold from shop Q. So now r is 90 less than right. So let's find what is 35%age of this number. After finding 35% subtract 90 resultant will be the total product which was sold total pencil that was sold from R. Right? So we can find out of this 600 what is 35%. So out of this 600 we can find what is 30% and 5 percentage. So 10 percentage is how much? 60. 30%age is how much? 180. What about 5 percentage? 1 percentage will be 60. So 5 percentage will be 30. So 210. So 210 is what? So 210 will be the total lost value. That is the total pencil which was sold from Q, right? Stationary shop Q. So now what they saying is stationary shop R is 90 less. So when you subtract 90 from 210, which will be 120. So 120 will be the total pencil that was sold on stationary shop R. So now what is the question and what we need to find is find the total number of notebook that was sold from R and we know that so pencil according to the chart only one value was missing in the R that to the last value. So now we found the last value as 120. Look at the R. What about the first value? So total number of pin that was sold here is 180. So 180 is the total number of pins sold right and now according to the question we found are total number of pencil is 120. So if you add these two value 120 + 180 resultant will be 300 right. So now we our target is to find how much percentage of notebook sold by R notebook for R is how much percentage which is 50%age that means the remaining this value will be 50%age because these are pencil and pen. So pencil and pen alone which is 300 and according to the chart they have given notebook as 50%age. If 50%age is notebook then the remaining 50%age will be 300. So our target is to find what is the remaining 50%. So the remaining 50%age will be 300. So friends understood or not? So the answer for this question you can able to find again if this 300 is 50%age. Then again we need to find what is 100%. Again you are going to find what is 50% better 50/50 which is equal right? If these two product total is equals to 50, our target is also to find the 50%age. So better we can say 50%age is equals to 300. So which will be the answer for the first question, right? So again you have to understand the concept first the basic concept clearly right what are all the values we have they have given in the question and how to figure out from the table chart to find the remaining value that is the most important thing. So first what we did is initially they are talking about the pen not the pencil first they are talking about the pen. So pen that is from P and Q. So now what they said is in the first point of the question. So Q will be 1 by3 less than P. So what I did from the P I have found what is 2x3 which is 240. That means 240 will be the total pen that was sold from the stationary shop Q. And then in the stationary shop queue according to the chart we know the remaining two value. So by using this three value we can easily find what is the 100%age of the stationary item which is available on the shop queue. Why? Because if these two values are 60%age then the remaining this value will be 40. So 40%age is equals to 240. 100%age is equal to x. So 600 600 is what the total stationary item that was available on the shop cube. So we have found it. So now the last point what they have given is in the stationary R where the total pencil sold is 90 less than Q. So we have to find what is 35%age of the pencil that was available from the total on this shop. So 35%age of 600 which is how much? 210. So 210 is the total pencil that was available on shop Q. So now shop R is 90 less. When you subtract 90 from this point resultant will be 120. So 120 will be the total pencil available. And according to the chart the total pen available is 180. Our target is to find what is the total number of notebook. Right? So if you add these two value resultant will be 50%. Why? Because notebook is 50. So remaining 50 will be these two total. So when you add these two resultant will be 300. So we can easily find what is 50%age which is 300. So this will be the answer for the first question. So I think if you solve the first question the remaining question all will be easy because you understood the complete concept how to find out the remaining missing value. So only thing is we should know how to find that missing value alone. Many times I have told this if you learn if you understand to solve one question on DA in the mains exam I am saying right not in the prelims exam in the mains exam if you can able to solve one question if you can able to find one missing value in the DA solving all the remaining four will be easy at least you can try out of five you will get answer for three so only one question that is alone important where you only if you know the concepts you can able able to solve it right or else you can't able to solve this question. So friends that's the reason many times I will be keep on saying this learn the basics properly take your time even 8 hours even eight or 10 days to learn profit and loss concept that is not at all a problem but after 10 days you should solve all the question on it you should not struggle and you should not stuck anywhere without knowing the concept that is the most important thing right so now let me answer for the first question is 300 second question if the total pen sold by shop Q is half of the total pens sold by shop T and the total number of pens of so total number of pen and notebook sold by shop T is 1 to 80. Then find the ratio between the pencils that was sold from shop Q to the pen that was sold from shop T. Okay, so our final target is to find the ratio, right? I think most of the values are missing here but okay let let's find it. So first let me read the first question again. First point again if the total pen sold from shop Q right. So total pen that was sold from shop Q is half of the pen that was sold from shop T. So shop T the total number of pen that was sold is how much? Sorry I think I poured the ink extra on this pen. Okay. Okay. So now sorry. So Q right? So Q is how much compared to T of So T is how much? So T according to the chart. So T value is 480. So 480 divided by 2 which is 240. So 240 will be the total pen that was sold from shop Q of pen is 240. Right? That is the first point we have found it. So next what they are saying is and the total number of pen and notebook sold by shop T. So shop T pen and notebook right. So shop T pen and notebook which is equals to 1280. So this is the value what they have given in the question. Now look at the chart. When you look at the chart where in shop Total number of pen they have given how much they have given is 480 right so notebook value which is not given that is missing but the last value they have given pencil so pencil is how much so pencil will be 36% yes so 36%age is the pencil so just now while solving the first question I have told you if one value is 36 then what about the remaining two value Out of 100 if you subtract 36 year resultant will be 64%age that 64%age will be the remaining pen and the notebook and we know that this total will be equal to 1280. So we can easily find what is the total product stationary product that was available from t why? Because pencil is 36 remaining 2 will be 64. So that 64%age is equals to 1280. So we can easily find what is 100% is equals to X. So this will be 2 * which is 20 X is equals to 2,000. So 2,00 is what the total three stationary item that was available on shop T. So now we found the T value right. So total product value. So now okay now according to the question what are all the remaining things that we need to find here is then find the ratio between the total pencil sold by Q. Okay. So total pencil sold by Q to the total pencil sold by shop T. Okay. So total pencils sold by shop T is how much? 36%age. Yes. So 36%age is the total pencil that was sold. And we know the total value which is 2,000. So out of this 2,000 we have to find what is 36% because 36%age will be the total pencil that was sold from shop T. So for 36 percentage 30 + 6 percentage so 30%age will be 10 percentage 600. So 600 will be 30%age. What about 6? 6 will be 120. Right? So 720. So 720. So next thing what we need to find here is the find the total pencil that was sold by shop Q. So according to the question we know that the total pen that was sold is 240. So 240 is the total pen which is equals to how much percentage? 40%age. So now our target is to find what is the total pencil. So total pencil is how much? 35%. So we have to find what is 35%. So 35 percentage is equals to x. Right? So we can cancel this. This will be six times. So x is equals to 6 5 are 30. Remaining will be 3. 6 3's are 18. 18 + 3 will be 21. I think this is the value what we found in the previous question. So 210. So 210 will be the total pencil that was it's it's like a previous question. Previous question we have did the same right? So we found 100%age and then we found what is 35. But here we can directly find it right. So now the total pencil that was sold on shop Q is 210 and this will be the total number of pencil that was sold from shop T which is 720. So now according to the question our target is to find the ratio value. So 210 is to 720. So we can cancel 0 0 here. I think we can cancel it on three table. 7 3es are 21. Cancel it on three table. 2 3's are 6. 4 3's are 12. That's it. So finally the ratio for this value is 7 is to 24. So which will be the answer for the second question. Right? So again it's it's like I hope you can able to solve all the remaining question easily. Right? So the remaining question you can easily solve it because once you understood that's what I initially said you once you understand the basics how to find one missing value finding all the remaining stuff is easy. So I just go through all the remaining question once so next question is also similar like required percentage x - y by y into 100. Yes you can try and solve it right. So I've just solved only two question because some students don't know how to uh apply the value to figure out the answer. So that's the reason I've just taught you two question. I hope now you understood the concept. So please write the test only the test will help you to improve your score in the mains exam. Right? So friends, thank you so much for watching this video. So see you on the next video. So thank you so much. Bye.",unknown
QveCw3mUy38,"If I fix here the earliest x, we have to find what is 20%age. Yes or no? Right? 20%age of this number is definitely a fraction one because if you find what is 20%age of x, you will be getting around 1 by 5. So I don't want answer to be in a fraction. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to take the early as 5x. I'm going to assume the early as 5x. If I assume it as 5x finding 20%age of the number is easy. Why? Because what is 10%age of the number? So 10 percentage of the number will be five. 20%age of the number will be one. So we can say that the people who arrived early right so total number of doctors who arrived early out of this doctor total number of doctors who gone early which will be X. So friends understood or not how I found this? So this is the most important part of the question. If you can able to understand this solving the complete question is easy. So once you can it's again it's upon your wish you can assume it as x and you can solve the question you will you are going to get the same answer. But the problem is if you are weak in mathematics or if you are struggling to solve some of the max numbers then always don't go with the decimal point values. If you go with some decimal point values then finding an answer will be difficult. So I don't want to get any decimal point numbers. So what I'm doing here is instead of assuming it as x I am taking it as 5x. If I take it as 5x finding the 20%age of the number is easy. So 20%age is 1 by five. So I can cancel five and five here. So we can say that out of 5x the doctors who left early will be one x. In case instead of 5x if we are assuming it as x then finding 20 percentage will be 20 by 100 which will be 1x 5. So 1x 5x so 1x 5x will be the total number of doctors who left early. Whether x is easy or 1x 5x is easy. So I would always prefer going with a normal integer number because if the numbers are in a fraction if the numbers are in a decimal point definitely I will make a mistake. So that's the reason assuming a value is the most most important part in most of the difficult level data interpretation because some some some questions you can able to see while I'm solving I will assume it as 100%age on some question I will take that as 200%age. Why? Because if I keep 100% I'm getting an answer in some decimal point value 33.33 etc. But on the same number if I have take it as 200%age I won't get any decimal point percentage number. So that comes only in practice. If you didn't learn that, kindly learn by watching this video how to assume a",unknown
u4CWJxn8eiM,"First of all, thanks for being here in my YouTube channel. So friends, before watching this video, so do not forget to purchase my aptitude quantitative aptitude book on Amazon. In case if it is out of stock, you can directly purchase for the same price at our platform. The link is in the description. So friends, now let me move on to the 32nd data interpretation for the mains level exam. So here it's a caselet DA, right? So we have to read the passage I think 3D DA which we are from 30 31 32 mostly we are solving a case DA. So they have given a passage here. So based upon the passage so we have to read the complete passage and either it's a table chart you can frame a table chart or or write the values separately and based upon the questions what they have given we have to find out the answer right so interesting question so I hope you have taken the test. So kindly again I'm saying first write the same question same numbers everything is same what I'm going to teach here as a test I have given already 12 hours back. So first write the test understand where you are struggling to solve a question and then come and watch this video so that you can able to learn that what are all the mistakes that you are doing while writing the test or you don't know where the if you are struggling right on the concepts basic concepts so that you can learn all those things by watching the video. So now let me move on to this question. One day a hospital all the doctors were present. However, not all of them arrived on time nor did all of them stay until the end of their duty shift. So while first point we can able to see the question was talking about some hospitals where all the doctors were present. So that means all the doctors were present. The total number of doctors was not given. So, so let's assume the total number of doctors as 100%age. Usually we do this. We always assume as 100%age as a base number. So similarly we can assume 100%age doctors were present. So now what they are saying is however not all of them arrived on time. Not nor did all of them stay until the end of their duty shift. So out of 100%age of the doctors every doctor was not arrived at the time. Some were late or somewhere early and some were on time. Right? So now let's we move on to the first point on that day. So someday right so let's take an operation day of all the doctors who arrived early for their shift 20%age left early 40%age stayed late and the remaining left on time. So only three points they have given in the question. First point what they are saying is of all the doctors who arrived early and the second point of all the doctors who arrived late. Third point of all the doctors who arrived on time. So totally we have three points right? So total number of doctors who arrived late, total number of doctors who arrived on time and the total number of doctors who arrived early. So three data has been given and out of three data right we don't know what is the total number of doctors here. So what we can do here is just let let we assume some value. We can assume that the total number of doctors who arrived early right let's let's take this as x because we don't know how many total doctors are there in the hospital. So let's assume the total number of doctors who arrived early is x. Similarly the total number of doctors who arrived on time is y and the total number of doctors who were late which is z. Right. Let let's assume. So if you add X + Y + Z this will be the total number of doctors in the ACM hospital. Right? Let's let's take this as a base value X Y and Z. Now first point of the doctors who arrived early. So we know that the total number of doctors who arrived early we assumed it as X. So out of the doctors who arrived early, some of the doctors left early, right? And some of the doctors are they left on time and some of the doctors were left the hospital late, right? So either you can frame a table chart this upon your wish, right? But I think we have only small datas here, right? So only doctors who left early, right? Early on time and then late. So I I don't I think I don't want to frame a table chart in case if required you can do that right. So now what they are saying is out of the total doctors who came early right so you can see 20 percentage left early we know that out of this x we need to find what is 20%age. So friends just listen here this is the important area to solve the question. Why? Because always assuming a value is the most important part on the mains level competitive exam question for example if we have a ratio value 7 is to 10 example I'm saying you can assume this 7 is to 10 as 7000 yes or no because when you cancel this let's take this as a value and this as b value so they have given a is to b as 7 is to 10 so what we do is we can assume this as 7 x and 10 X some people will do like that and some people will take it as a as 70 b as 100 but some people will take it as a as 700 b as 1,000 whatever way you can take the number because whatever the value that you are going to assume the final answer what you're getting going to get will be same for all but one thing here is if you need to find what is 10%age of the number for example for a if you need to find what is 10%age of the number. So people who assumed a as 700 finding 10 percentage is easy. What is 10 percentage of the number is 70. So total number of students who assumed the value of a as 70 finding 10 percentage is easy which is only seven. But people who take it as 7x and 10 x if you want to find what is 10 percentage of the number or 20%age of the number. So in this area for example if you take seven and 10 as it is a as 7 B as 10 at this point if you need to find what is 10 percentage of the number which will be 7 I don't want to make a number complicated right because if you go with a decimal values there are more chances of making a mistake don't if you are going to assume some value based on the value if you are going to find all the remaining one make sure the assume assume value right should be uh the final answer what we are going to calculate that should not be on a decimal point value or else we should not get in a fraction so just just listen here if I fix here the earliest x we have to find what is 20%age yes or no right 20% of this number is definitely a fraction one because if you find what is 20% of x you will be getting around 1 by So I don't want answer to be in a fraction. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to take the early as 5x. I'm going to assume the early as 5x. If I assume it as 5x, finding 20%age of the number is easy. Why? Because what is 10%age of the number? So 10%age of the number will be five. 20%age of the number will be one. So we can say that the people who arrived early, right? So total number of P doctors who arrived early out of this doctor total number of doctors who gone early which will be X. So friends understood or not how I found this. So this is the most important part of the question. If you can able to understand this solving the complete question is easy. So once you can it's again it's upon your wish you can assume it as X and you can solve the question you will you are going to get the same answer. But the problem is if you are weak in mathematics or if you are struggling to solve some of the max numbers then always don't go with the decimal point values. If you go with some decimal point values then finding an answer will be difficult. So I don't want to get any decimal point numbers. So what I'm doing here is instead of assuming it as x I am taking it as 5x. If I take it as 5x finding the 20%age of the number is easy. So 20%age is 1x five. So I can cancel five and five here. So we can say that out of 5x the doctors who left early will be x. In case instead of 5x if you are assuming it as x then finding 20 percentage will be 20 by 100 which will be 1x 5. So 1x 5x. So 1x 5x will be the total number of doctors who left early. whether x is easy or 1x 5x is easy. So I would always prefer going with a normal integer number because if the numbers are in a fraction if the numbers are in a decimal point definitely I will make a mistake. So that's the reason assuming a value is the most most important part in most of the difficult level data interpretation because some some some questions we can able to see while I'm solving I will assume it as 100%age on some question I will take that as 200%age why because if I keep 100%age I'm getting an answer in some decimal point value 33.33 etc. But on the same number if I have take it as 200 percentage I won't get any decimal point percentage number. So that comes only in practice. If you didn't learn that kindly learn by watching this video how to assume a value. So now it is easy right? So the total number of doctors who left early will be 20%age. So now next point is 40%age stayed late. So out of this 5x doctors right how much of doctors stayed late is 40%age. So 40 percentage of 5x. So just see out of this 5x what is 40%age. So 40 by 100. So we can cancel 0 0. So 2 * 5 * cancel 5 and 5 resultant will be 2x. So 2x will be the total number of doctors who left late right. Yes. who uh total number of doctors who stayed late out of this doctors who arrived early and the doctors 2x of doctors who stayed late right so the remaining will be on time right that's what they have mentioned it and the remaining left on time that means 2x x will be 3x out of total 5x 3x doctors were late and early so the remaining x will be the total number of doctors who will be on time so friends understood or not how I calculated this so this three value. Once you understood how I found this three value then solving the complete question is easy right? So first try to understand the question properly what are all the values they have given here and try to figure out all these values. So first we have assumed it and this 5x is what? Out of total doctors, the doctors who arrived early and what is this three value? Out of the total doctors who arrived early, some doctors left early, some doctors left late and some doctors left on time. So these three datas percentage they have given in the first point 20%age of the doctors who left early from the doctors who arrived early. So why I assumed it as 5x? Just now I have told you if I assume it as 5x I will not get any value in a decimal or in a fraction. So I have assumed it as 5x. So x will be the total number of doctors who arrived early. And what they have next point 40%age of the doctors were late. So out of 5x I have calculated what is 40%age which will be 2x. So 2x will be the total number of doctors who left late. So the remaining will be on time. So late and early total will be 3x and the total number of doctors who arrived early is 5x out of 5x when you eliminate 3x remaining will be 2x that 2x will be the total number of doctors who were on time. So friends understood or not how I found it. So similarly based upon the remaining point we have to find the remaining value right. So this let let's take this as early and this will be on time and this will be late and similarly the second late value has been given. So now let's let's calculate the on-time value where is the on time given on time value. Okay. So on-time value they have given as a last point. So now let let's solve the on-time value. So the third point I'm reading not the second point. So third point here is of the doctors who arrived on time we have assumed it as y based upon the percentage value we can assume it as a different value. So 37.5 percentage left early. So when just see here out of the doctors who arrived on time were 37.5 percentage of the doctors who left early. If you find 37%age of Y, you will not get an answer in terms of an integer because you have to know what is 37.5 percentage. 37.5 percentage if you convert into a fraction value which will be 3x8. So 3x8 is the fraction value of 37.5. So 3x 8 of y again you will get the 3x8 of y. I don't want the answer to be in the terms of fraction. So friends just now I have told you. So what value you can assume here? So that the complete value should not be in terms of a fraction. If I assume y as 8 y then I can cancel y and y here. My final answer will be in the term of integer. So mean understood or not what I did is right. So instead of y if I assume it as 8 y finding 37.5 percentage is easy for me. So what I'm going to do here is the total number of doctors who arrived on time let take take this as 8 y. So now what the question says 37.5 percentage left early. 37.5 percentage which is 3 Y. So 3 Y is the total number of people who left. Total number of doctors who arrived on time were left early is 3 Y. So this is the way you have to assume the value. What is the next point? The same percentage stayed late and the rest on time. The same percentage that means the same percentage were stayed late. Same percentage we found 3 Y. So 3 Y people were straight line. So this is also 3 Y because both are same. At last what they are saying is and the and the rest the remaining left on time. So 3 + 3 is six. So total is 8 Y. So 8 Y 6 Y will be 2 Y. So 2 Y will be the total number of people arrived on time. So friends left on time. So friends understood or not? So this is the easy technique where you can solve the question easily. If you are going with the fraction value then yes you can. Many students usually ask me why can I take it as a fraction value directly. Yes you can but calculation part will be little bit difficult. Why? Because you have to take LCM you have to frame a equation. So those part will be difficult but other than that everything will be easy. So now the third late right the second point just a moment. Yes second point. So of the doctors who arrived late 50%age stayed late. So now we have assumed this as 5x and 8 y and at last the total number of doctors who arrived late. So based upon the first value right first value what they have given us of the doctors who of the doctors who arrived late. Okay 50%age stayed late. So similarly of the doctors some doctors will be early and some doctors leaving on time and some doctors were late. So now according to the question what they are saying is 50%age of the doctors were stayed late. So 50%age of the number 50%age of the number is what half of the number if you assume this as zed only zed 50%age will be 1 by two of zed again I'm getting in a fraction value I don't want to get in a fraction. So let's assume this as 4 zed. If you assume this value as 4 zed, what is 50%age of the number? 50%age will be 2 zed. So 2 zed will be the total number of doctors who left late from the doctors who arrived late. Right? So similarly the next point is 25%age on time. 25%age is what? 1x4. So 1x4 of the doctors were on time. So 1x4 is into four zed will be zed. So zed will be doctors who arrived on time. Late will be 2 zed. So 2 zed zed 3 zed. So remaining will be only one z. So early will be zed. That's the point whether and the rest will be left early. So and the rest will be left early. So zed zed and 2 zed. So friends understood or not. Right? If you wish you can frame a table chart that is that is completely upon your wish. But if you solve more number of question case question you can have a proper format right like this some questions I have solve it on a table chart why because if it is a lengthy process for example four colleges has been given uh five different subject has been given so on those cases I would always recommend you to go with a table chart but if the values are smaller just only three points they have given so what I'm doing here is I'm just taking a note of each and everything in a proper way so that we won't make any mistakes right so friends understood I think the remaining part other than this solving will be easy okay anyway I can uh solve and show you how to find out the answer so now what what is the other data they have given here is the first the last point what they have given us just a moment yes so the last passage Last passage what they have given below the three point is the number of doctors who arrived early was equal to the number of doctors who left on time. And the number of doctors who left early was 39 more than the number of doctors who arrived late. The number of doctors who did not leave on time was 144. So totally they have given three points. Right? What are all the points they have given here is first point the number of doctors who arrived early was equal to the number of doctors who left on time. This is the first point they have given which is equal. So equal means you have to equate the equ two equation. So first equation what they are saying is the number of doctors who arrived early. So number of doctors who arrived early is what? 5x. So 5x is the number of doctors who arrived early which is equal to so this value is equal to the number of doctors who left on time. So the number of doctors who left on time this is the number of doctors who arrived on time. The number of doctors who left on time is this will be the number of doctors who left on time. This will be the number of doctors who left on time and this will be the value the total number of doctors who left on time. So you have to add these three value. So 2x + 2 y + z. So friends understood or not how I wrote this equation. So the total number of doctors who arrived early arrived which we have assumed it as 5x which is equals to the total number of doctors who left on time. So this value is left on time first value. This value will be the total number of doctors who left on time and this will be the total number of doctors who left on time. So now what we can do here is so 3x is equals to 2 y + z. So let's assume this as equation one. So equation number two. So based upon the point we have to frame the equation right. So second equation is and the number of doctors who left early was 39. The number of doctors who left early, right? The total number of doctors who left early. See early will be X early will be 3 Y early will be Z. So three equations. So X 3 Y Z X + 3 Y + Z. So what they are saying is this doctors left was 39 more than the number of doctors who arrived late. See which is equals to 39 more than the doctors than the doctors who arrived late. So who arrived late is how much? 4 Z. So 39 + 4 zed. So you have to simplify this equation now. So x + 3 y. So minus of 3 z is equals to 39. So let's take this as equation number two. And what about the equation number three? Third point. So third point what they have mentioned is they have given the total. So total number of doctors who did not arrived on time. If the doctors who did not arrived on time that means the total doctor early and late. So early is how much x late is how much? 2x. So 2x plus x will be 3x because the total number of doctors who were not arrived on time. So that will be the total number of doctors who arrived late as well as the total number of doctors who left early. That will be the total number of doctors who does not arrive on time. Right? So let's take x and 2x will be 3x 3 y 3 y will be 6 y and uh 2 z will be 3 zed which is equals to 144. So this will be the third point they have mentioned here. So now what is the target? Our target is to find so we have to solve the three equation in order to get x y and z. So I think the only easy way is if I find one value finding the remaining is easy right because the complete value itself we have assumed x y z here and there. So if I need to find one value from this equation it is easy. So when just see here 3x here also I have 3x 6 y 3 z. So if okay if I multiply this equation 1 by 3. So this becomes 9x this becomes 6 y and this becomes 3. So friends understood or not what I did here. Right. So first I have just multiplied the first equation by 3. So that this becomes 9x 6 y and 3 z. So we we already have in the third equation 6 y and 3 z. So 6 y and 3 z which is equals to 9x. So instead of 6 y and 3 z we can substitute here as 9x which is equals to 144. So 12x is equals to 144. So x is equals to 12. So finally we got the value of x which is equals to 12. So once you got the value of x is equals to 12. So the total number of doctors who arrived early will be 60. And if you know the value of x is equals to 12. finding these three values will be easy. Similarly, finding y and finding is based upon this equation is easy because once you find one value, substituting in if you substitute x here and substitute x here, you will get y and z. So y and z if you simplify the equation you will get what is the value of y and what is the value of zed right? So very simple and easy of not the complete question very simple and easy this part alone I am saying but the question complete part is not that much easy but assuming the value is the important part here in the question you have to assume the proper uh data right only if you take a proper value from the given data of the question you can able to find out the answer clearly if you are okay with the fraction you can assume x y z if you feel that fraction value you will make any mistake assuming the value is important starting of this video I've told you how to assume a value right so if it is 37.5 we know 37.5 is 3x 8 so instead of assuming it as y if I take it as 8 y we can cancel and 8 and 8 so that the value will not be in a fraction value we will get directly as 3 y so instead of that instead of assuming it as y I have assumed it as 8 y so similarly instead of assuming it as only x I I have assumed it as 5x because finding 20 percentage is easy. So when you practice more number of question automatically you will get how to assume a value. So this kind of part will able to see on the tough level competitive exams not on the prelims or not on SSE railway. So those competitive exams you won't see this kind of question but only if you're preparing for a bank mains or CAT exam mains you can able to see this kind of question. So friends I think solving all the question if you find XY Z I hope you can able to find all the remaining five question on the test. So that will be easy. So you don't want to worry about it. Only thing is framing a table chart alone feels difficult. So friends thank you so much for watching this video and if you really like it share this video to your friends those who are preparing for the competitive exams. So thank you so much.",unknown
rLgoygejYt8,"First of all, thanks for being here in my YouTube channel. So friends, before watching this video, so do not forget to purchase my aptitude quantitative aptitude book on Amazon. In case if it is out of stock, you can directly purchase for the same price at our platform. The link is in the description. So friends, now let me move on to the 32nd data interpretation. I think it's a case DA. So they have given a passage here. So based upon the passage we need to find out some of the values and then we have to find the answer for all the five question based upon this passage. So friends always I recommend you to first write the test the same question same value everything is same 12 hours before posting this video I usually give the same question as a test on aptitude reasoning test package. So first kindly write the test only if you write the test you can able to understand which point you are struggling and where you are not getting the answer and then come and watch this video automatically you will start learning and start rectifying all your mistakes by just watching only this video you can learn something but you don't know where you are making a mistakes so better again and again I'm saying first write the test and then come and watch this video right so friends now let me move on to this question so four shopkeeper sold sold four different mobile phones, iPhone, Samsung, OnePlus and nothing. EA sold 162. Okay. So the point is getting started from the third line. So what what they have mentioned is there are four shopkeepers and they are selling four different phones. So I always prefer go with a small table so that we won't make any mistakes in the exam. If it is three data then we can go with the set theory. I've told previously many times. So here they are talking about four different shopkeepers and four different mobile phones. So better we can go with a small table chart right. So for this is for an uh iPhone and then Samsung and nothing. So let's keep this as a total right in case if they have given a total we can take it as a total. So there are four shopkeepers. So a b c and d. So always make sure to draw a table chart like this. So that we won't make because in the exams we have an a paper right additional papers. So here and there we used to solve and after solving it we don't know where is the value what we find already. So better having a table chart might help you in most of the cases without making any mistake and sometimes we can manage the time also easily. So first point A sold 162 Samsung which is 12.5% more than the Samsung sold by B. See what they are saying is A sold 162 Samsung's. So it's a direct statement. So the person A is selling a total mobile sorry Samsung mobile phone which is 162 and what they are saying is this 162 is which 12.5%age more than the Samsung that was sold by B. So we know that the B will be also selling a Samsung but the person A is selling which is one how much percentage 12.5 percentage more than B. So how we can find the value here just see if this is 100% this will be 162 which is 112.5 percentage or no because 12.5%age more. So 100%age is the total Samsung mobile that was sold by B. So Samsung mobile that was sold by A is 162. So which is 112.5%age will be 162. Then what about 100% is equals to X. So friends there are different way to solve this value. Either you can keep the percentage value as it is or else you can convert the percentage into a fraction. For example 12.5 percentage fraction value will be 1x 8. So 1x8 in terms of percentages it will be 12.5 percentage. Either you do like this or directly take it as 112.5 and try to cancel out in five table either way right it's it's upon your wish so 12.5 can be taken as 1x 8 so 1 + 1 by 8 is equals to 162 so 9 by 8 is equals to 162 then what about 1 part is equals to x so we can cancel it 1 9 are 9 1 9 are 9 72 8 8s are 64 again 144 so this will be 144. So if you find 12.5%age for 144 and you add that value resultant will be 162. So the total Samsung mobile sold by B is 144 and out of this 144 12.5 percentage more will be 162. So friends understood how I calculated we have learned more times on percentage topic how to find this value either you can directly cross multiply or else you can cancel this on five table one way of solving it or else another way is 12.5 can be converted into a fraction value 1x 8 so why I added 1 here because 100 + 12.5 so 1 + 1x 8 which will be 162 so I'm going to find what is one part which is 100% that is 144 four. So two different way you can find out the answer here. So second average of iPhone, Samsung and nothing sold by B is 162. Okay. So average of iPhone, Samsung and nothing. So iPhone, Samsung and nothing. Right? So these three value average. So iPhone, Samsung and nothing. Okay? So what they have given is the average for so iPhone, Samsung and nothing. Average means divided by 3 which is equals to 162. So 162 into 3. So this will be 681. So 486. So 486 will be the average of no 486 is the total of iPhone, Samsung and nothing. But we know only one value which is 144 here that is Samsung phone. So let let's substitute Samsung as 144 here. So that we will get what is iPhone and nothing. So it is equals to 486 - 144 resultant will be 2 year 4 year 3. So 342 is iPhone and nothing. So friends understood or not? By using the average value we found the sum of all the three mobile phones. After finding the sum we already from the previous point we calculated 144 is Samsung. So instead of Samsung I have substituted 144. So bring this towards right hand side minus 144. Resultant will be the total number of iPhone and nothing will be 342. So iPhone and nothing which is 342. But we don't know all the two values. Let it be right. So let me calculate at the end. Okay. Okay. So next point is iPhone sold by D and B is in the ratio 9 is to 10. So iPhone sold by D and B is in the ratio 9 is to 10. If the D is 9 ratio and B will be 10 ratio is 9 is to 10. Yes. 9 is to 10 ratio. But we don't know both the values. Okay. So next point 1 + sold by B is 60%age more than 1 + sold by C. So 1 + sold by B right is 60% more than 1 + sold by C. If this is 100%age this will be 160%age because both the values are missing here but they have given us a point so I have taken down as a clue. So if C is 100%age then B will be 160%age 60%age more. So next point Samsung sold by C is same as this nothing sold by A. So Samsung sold by C is same as the nothing sold by A. So these two values are same right? So this value and this value both are same. So it's my way of solving. You can solve it in a different different way. So that it's I always say if it is equal I used to put a small dot and and then I just draw a small dotted line so that at last I can able to figure out all the clues right that's the reason I'm doing like this it's completely upon your wish so next thing is C sold 524 by3 percentage more iPhone than okay so then we already know that is some value but what they are saying is where the iPhone that was sold by C is 52 4x3 percentage so 52 4x3 percentage more okay than the OnePlus that was sold by the C till now we found only two values right okay okay let it be the total number of mobile phones sold by A is same as all the Samsung sold by all the four shopkeepers which is equals to 650 50. So what they are saying is total number of mobile phones sold by A. So total number of mobile phone is sold by A which is equals to 650. And this value is same as the total shopkeepers those who sells the Samsung. This is also 650 and this is also 650. So if I found one value finding the next value is easy. So similarly if I find the remaining value which is easy to figure out what is this 650 right? So uh I think that will be easier to find. Okay. So let's target any values here. So average next point is there. So average number of nothing sold by A DB is 192. So average number of nothing sold by A DB. So A DB. Okay. So a db so nothing found that from a b and d which is equals to 192 because of an average we have to multiply by three 27 576. So 576 is what all the three value a b and d. So a b and d which is equals to 576. If I found any one value remaining is easy. Okay. So next point is so next point. So A sold 192 on OnePlus which is 28%age more than the iPhone sold by B. So friends it's a direct statement where you can able to see A sold 192 on OnePlus. It's a direct point they have given A sold 192 and this 192 which is equal to 28%age more than the iPhone that was sold from B. But here we don't know how much iPhone was sold by B year but we know only the ratio value. But now according to the question from this value 28%age more will be 192. So similar to this logic so 192 will be 128%. 128%age will be 192 is 28% more. Okay. So let's find what is 100%. So 100 percentage is equals to X is equals to 150. So we can say that this will be 150. So means listen here we found the total iPhone that was sold by B is 150 now and we already know that these two values are in a ratio 9 is to 10. So now we can easily say 10 part will be 150. So 10 part which is equals to 150. Then what about 9 part is equals to x. So x is equals to 95 are 45 4 135. So 135 is what? The total number of iPhone that was sold by D is 135. So finally we found this value this value and some values here. If I found one value finding finding nothing is easy. If I find nothing this value is easy. Okay. So we got it most of the answers here. So next value is or 50%age more than iPhone sold by A. So this 192 it can be two chances. 1 is 192 is 28% more than iPhone sold by B. Or else this 192 is 50%age more than the iPhone that was sold by A. That is the point they have mentioned it. Just read the point. So A sold 192 which is 28%age more than iPhone sold by B or else 50%age more than the iPhone that was sold by A. So this value will be 150. So 150% will be 192. 100% is equals to X resultant will be 128. So similarly if you find 150 is equals to 192 then what about 100% is equal I just calculated in the mind. Why? Because we can cancel it on five tables. 50 table this will be three this will be two. So once you cancel it 6 3's are 18 remaining will be 14. So 4 into 64 will be 128. So if you find 50%age of 128 which is 64 again add 64 to this number resultant will be 192 right percentage logic. So now just friends just see here we found for the shopkeeper a 1 2 three values and according to the question they have given the total also which is 650. So now finding this value is very easy. Why? Because if you add all the three value subtract with 650 resultant will be the shopkeeper who got the total number of nothing phone that was sold from A. So let's let's add this. So 2 4 12 9 15 17 already we have 1 8 1 1 2 3 4 So 4 650 2 * 8 168. So this value will be 168. If this value is 168, we already know that these two values are same. So this will also be 168. So two value finally I found is 168 and 168. Okay. I think this value we can find out here. Why? Because we know the sum of all the four values. I think they have mentioned here sum of all the four values is equals to 650. And this sum of four value which is which is equals to 650. So we can add this and subtract here. So 8 4 12. So 12 to 16. So 176 right 176 will be the total Samsung mobile that was sold by the shopkeeper D right still more points are remaining I think uh iPhone and nothing which is equals to 342 I think see we uh from this B we already noted down one thing the average has been given I think so so they have given the average and we know that iPhone and nothing is equals to 342 and we know we found iPhone is 150. So if you subtract 342 and 150 resultant will be the nothing here. So again another add another 150 uh which is 300 and 42 uh 150 192. So 192 will be the total nothing mobile that was sold by B only these two this value is alone missing. If I found the total finding this value is easy and also we know that a b was 576. So a b and d is 576 that is nothing. Just see here friends a b d which is 576. We know a nothing is 168. B nothing is 17 192. So finding d nothing will be easy because we know the total 576. So 5 76 minus of 168 and 192 and which will be 200. So 500 216 to 216. So 216 will be the total uh nothing phone that was sold by the shopkeeper D. Most of the values we found I think so right is there still any values missing that we can able to find if I know this total finding this easy okay still some more points are also remaining right so the total number of uh mobile phone sold by D is 653 see just now we are talking about and the values has been given the total number of mobile phone that was sold is 653 so this will be 653 right if this value is 65 53. Finding this will be easy. 6 6 are 12 12 17 six times here. So 1 718 11 already we have taken 2 126. So 126 will be the total number of 1 plus that was sold by the shopkeeper D. I think if I know this value finding is easy. Two values are missing here. So net and nothing sold by C is 50% more than 1 plus sold by D. So nothing sold by C right is 50% more than 1 + sold by D 1 + sold by D. So it's it's 50% more right? If it is 50%age more then we already know that the oneplus that was sold by D is 126. So 126 50 percentage will be 63. So when you add both the values 6 78 189 189 will be the total number of nothing phone that was sold by the shopkeeper C. Right? So the last value total number of mobile phone sold by B is 694. So total number of mobile phone that was sold by B is 694. So this value is 694. If this value is 694, finding this value will be easy. Why? Because when you add all the three values subtract with 694, resultant will be this value. And if you find out this value, this value equal to 160. Finding this value will be easy. And figuring out this value will also be easy. 150. So 200 294 394 486 subtracted 2 28 so 2 08 right whether any other point is remaining. No that's it. So the the complete point has been given and we know that 160%age will be 28. What about 100 percentage? 100%age will be 1 130 right 130 10 percentage 6 3's are 18 178 so 130 because 10 percentage I how I calculated is 50%age 50%age will be half of this number uh which is around 65 So 65 and then we have to find what is 10 percentage 13 65 13 78 I just added 78 resultant will be 28 yes so friends I think u finally we found all the values and then if required we can find this also right because now finding all these values are easy just when you add all the yeah this value we didn't find it okay so this value is what 524 by3 percentage which is we already know that so this value that is the shopkeeper C who sells iPhone is equals to 1 + 52 4x3 percentage okay what we can do here is okay 52 1x3 I can rub this so 100% 1 53 1x3 will be 52 into 13. 3 2's are 6. 5 3's are 15. 2 5 so 676 divided by 1300 0 into 130. So friends understood or not how I wrote this right. So we know that 50 to 4x3 percentage more. So usually how we take it as 100 + 52 4x3. I have just converted it as 1 + 52 4x3 0. I think 13 0 0 when it bring here which becomes we can cancel this and we can cancel this 676 plus 3 6524 by 10 is the value is correct. Okay, I'm getting 198 here. So kindly check this out 198 whether it's correct or wrong because okay so it is 52 4 by3 percentage of 524 give me a time I can check whether the values are correct here just a moment just a moment Yes, I think 198 is correct. I hope you can able to uh figure it out out how how I found this answer. Just see I can or else I can write here. See how how we wrote here is 12.5 percentage I have written in a fraction of 1x 8 1 + 1x 8. So friends similarly here 52 4x3 percentage. So 52 into 52 into 13 which is 676. So we have to add four because converting the mixed fraction into a normal fraction. But here I have added directly. Okay. But 676 + 4 will be 680. So 680 right divided by 13 which is 13 0. So plus 100 here. So plus of into 130 because we have to find for this 130 how much percentage more? So into 130. So if you cancel these two values and 1 zero so 130 add here and cancel it here you will get an answer as 198 or else some students will take this as one part so one part 680 by 13 whatever way you will get the answer for sure right so this will be the complete answer for this question so I think yes it's a difficult one not an easy one but make sure to write down all the values in a perfect way right that is most important Because writing here and there in the exam papers we won't find where we found the previous value and we have lot of confusion right so because of the time pressure everything but remember one thing draw a table chart first and then whatever value that you find out from here first write down inside the table so that you won't make and you won't waste your time on finding the values again and again. So friends practice like this right practice more. So only if you practice more you will know an idea how to solve these kind of question. First write the test you definitely some students will make a mistakes here and there by just watching the video. I hope you understood where you have made a mistake. So rectify from the next DA. So friends thank you so much for watching this video. So see you soon on the next video. Bye.",unknown
z9HcTK6NnNo,"First of all, thanks for being here in my YouTube channel. So friends, before watching this video, so do not forget to purchase my aptitude quantitative aptitude book on Amazon. In case if it is out of stock, you can directly purchase for the same price at our platform. The link is in the description. So friends, now let me move on to the 30th data interpretation. So for the mains exam. So here you can able to see they have given a passage here which is called as it's one category of DA caselet data interpretation. So they will give you a passage. So you have to read the complete passage and you have to find out some of the values here. Either you can frame a table chart or some students used to solve a different different way like set theory. It's upon your wish but we have to figure out some of the values here by reading the complete question and then you have to solve all the five question based upon this passage. Right. So I hope you have taken the test. So kindly go and take the test first. I always recommend you to take the test. The same question, same numbers, everything will be same given as a test. So first write the test. So only then you can able to understand where you are making a mistake and which area you are struggling to solve and then come and watch this video. Definitely it will be helpful for you. So kindly without taking a test do not watch this video. You will not learn anything. Right? So now let me move on to this passage. So there was a race between Batman, Superman and Spider-Man. So they need to cover a particular distance from point A to B. So Spider-Man started in a jeep at a speed of x kilome per hour. So Batman started on bike at a speed of 60 km per hour and Superman started in a car at a speed of 80 kilome per hour simultaneously from point A. So I think this question is based upon the races races concept. So I think I have posted a separate lesson six lessons on the topic that is only on the races concept. Right? If if there is a circular track so three person are running in a circular track who will win the race. The first person is beating the second person by 20 minutes or first person wins the by second person by 20 kilometers. So these are the things that you have to learn how to solve a question that is based on a races. I think this is also a race concept because three person are starting the race from point A to point B and one person speed is not given that is Spider-Man. So where the Spider-Man speed is not given which is X kilome per hour but the second person that is Batman speed is 60 kilome per hour and the Superman speed will be 80 kilometers per hour. So now what they are saying is now and the point simultaneously from point A. Okay. So all the persons are starting from point A. After traveling 7 and half hours Superman car got punched and he reduced its speed by 50%age. So first they are talking about a superman car and we already know that the person's superman speed is how much superman started a car with a speed of 80 kilometer per hour. So we know that according to the question so the superman's speed will be 80 kilometer per hour. I hope you know the basics of time and distance what is the meaning of it? 1 hour superman will be traveling 80 kilometers. If it is 2 hours 160 kilometer if it is 3 hours 80 into three. If it is 4 hours 80 into 4. That is the way we calculate the total distance. So now what they are saying is the superman started the race from point A and he is traveling 7 and 1/2 hours 7 by 2 hours right. So after that is tire got punctured. So first what we can do here is let's check for the first 7 by2 hours what is the total distance E covers. So this is the time what they have given right. So this will be the time and for this time 7 by2 is nothing but 3.5. So 3.5 hours yes or no right. So 3.5 3 hours we know that for every 1 hour he will be traveling 80 kilometers. Then what about 3 hours? So 3 hours will be 8 into 3 which is 240. And then 0.5 is nothing but half an hour. So 1 hour if he is traveling 80 kilometer then half an hour will be 40. So 240 + 40 will be 280 kilome. So 280 kilome will be the initial distance that should be traveled by the superman in 7 by2 hours time 280 km and then his tire got punched. So from the first point first clue we found the time taken by using the time taken what is the distance that was traveled by the superman. Second point and after its tire got puncher what he what they are saying is he reduced the speed by 50%age. So he reduced the speed by 50. Now we already know that he is traveling at a speed of 80 kilome per hour. So because of puncher now the person's speed will be 40 kilometer per hour. Why? Because he reduced the speed by 50%age. That is half of the speed which will be 40 km/ hour. So now and he traveled another 1 and a half hours right by in this speed he is traveling another one 1 by 2 hour that means 1 and 1/2 hours. So 1 hour he will be traveling 40 right and then another half an hour. So 1 hour if it is 40 half an hour will be 20. So 40 + 20 will be 60. So now we can say that for the first 7 by 2 hours 280 kilometer and then 1 1 by 2 hours you will be traveling another 60 kilm right. So let it be let me find all the remaining distance. So next point after that he tried to change the tire for 30 minutes but it was in a vein. So he lift the car and started waiting for the lift. So, so what they are saying is after that he tried to change the tire of the car for 30 minutes. So, let's assume that 30 minutes he doesn't travel anywhere else because let's take it as he is taking a rest because he is changing the tire for the 30 minutes. But in this 30 minutes, he didn't travel anywhere else. So first he traveled 280 and then he traveled 60 and then he he was there in the same point for 30 minutes for changing the tire and then he decided to put the car there and he just waiting for the lift. So this was the third point they have given. So what about the fourth point after another half an hour he got a lift. See after another half an hour already half an hour he's waiting right and then another half an hour after another half an hour means so he is taking another 30 minutes right and after 30 minutes he got a lift in a truck so which is which was moving at a speed of 45 kilometer per hour okay so now what he is doing is he is traveling in a truck where the truck speed is 35 kilometer per hour. Okay, interesting question. So he traveled in the truck for next 450 kilometer. After that he jumped onto an another vehicle. So what he is doing is he's traveling in a truck where the truck speed is 45 km per hour and he traveled how much distance? 450 kilometers. Right? So this is the distance he traveled in a truck and we know that truck speed is 45 kilometer per hour. That means he will be taking 10 hours right because 1 hour 45 10 hours will be 450. So I think in the truck the person uh Superman would have traveled 10 hours. So next point is and then he jumped into an another vehicle moving at a speed of 100 kilometer per hour after traveling for 2 hours in that vehicle. So and then what he is doing is he is jumping to an another vehicle. So let's let's assume this vehicle where the speed has been given which is 100 kilome per hour. So some vehicle is traveling after the truck and he is again traveling for 2 hours. So 1 hour 100 kilometer. So 2 hours he will be traveling another 200 kilometers right? So interesting right? So 280 first and then after got punchured he traveled 60 kilome waited for half an hour and then another half an hour 1 hour he waited and then he got a lift in a truck he traveled 450 kilome and then again his vehicle got and then he jumped from this truck to another vehicle yes he is a superman he could have jumped this right I don't know what does the sentence mean okay so he jumped into an another vehicle and then he is traveling two hours which will be 200 kilometers Right. So next point after traveling 2 hours in a vehicle he get down and found the destination B was 2 kilo 250 kilometer from the on a road. So what they are saying is after reaching this point he found that the point B that is the destination place which was 250 kilometer from this point right from this point again he is looking at the destination place to reach. So this place where 250 kilometer from this point. So still one point is remaining but he took a shortest route and running at a speed of 35 kilome per hour where the destination B was only 105 kilome. So what he is doing is from this point he is taking a shortest distance and he is covering the shortest distance instead of 2 250 kilometer he is just covering only 1.5 kilometer. So to reach this destination place and the speed what they have given is 35 kilometer per hour. So which means 35 this will be 3 hours right because 1 hour 35 so 2 hours 70 so 3 hours will be 1.5. So finally he could have reached the destination place from A to B. So the complete passage they are talking about only one person that is about the superman right. So they have from the starting till the end we know that there are three person in a race but the complete passage and all the datas what they have given is only for the one person that is superman right so initially he covered four 280 kilometers and then the speed was reduced to 50%age that means half of the speed. So in the off of the speed he traveled another 1 and a half hours. So 1 hour 40 half an hour will be 20. So total will be 60. And then he is changing the tire for 30 minutes. And another after 30 minutes that means extra right next 30 minutes. And then only he got a lift from a truck and in a truck he is traveling 450 kilometers and the truck speed is 45 km/ hour. That means he will be traveling in a truck for 10 hours. Right? And then what he is doing is from the truck he is jumping to an another vehicle. So that vehicle is moving at a speed of 100 kilometer per hour and he is traveling for 2 hours. Then it will be 200 kilometers. After reaching the point he see the destination place which was 250 kilometers from that point. And what he is doing he is going in a shortest path where the shortest path he could have reached the distance in just 105 kilometers and he is traveling at a distance of traveling at a speed of 35 km per hour. That means this 105 kilometer he could have traveled for 3 hours. So friends just listen carefully after reading the complete passage and complete point what all the datas that we could find here is we can easily find what is the distance between A and B because let's let's I think I don't have place here okay I I write extra 30 minutes right sorry I don't have place to write because here you have question okay so let's let's now take point A right so point from point A is initially traveling 280 plus and another 60 and then plus another 450 plus another 200 right and plus the total distance will be another 250. We should not take the shortest path. Why? Because E is going in the different direction but actual distance between A and B will be 250. But what this superman is doing is he is going in the shortest path in order to reach faster. But that's not the point. The actual distance between A and B should be 250, 200, 450, 280, 60. So now let let me add all the values. So 400, right? This will be a 450. So 450 450 will be 900. So 900,00,240. So 1 1240. So 1 1240 is what is the total kilometer from point A to point B. Friends, understood. So this will be the total distance that we could able to figure out from the given passage that is 1 to 4. And also we can able to find out the time time taken by the superman to reach A to B because in most of the point they have given what is the time he traveled in all the distance. See 3.5 hours 1 1 hour 30 minutes. So let let we add all the values right. So this will be 7 by 2. So 7 by 2. So plus 1 1 by 2 will be 3x2. So plus and then he waited for half an hour and then another half an hour and then another 10 hours and then another 2 hours and then another 3 hours. So this will be the total time taken by the superman to reach the point A to point B. Yes or no? Because uh we know all the time what are all the time that that he is traveling for the distance is also given. So by using all the data we could have able we we can able to find the total distance as well. We can able to find for reaching this point A to B what will be the time taken right? So I think 10 15 this will be 16 right why because half an hour half an hour will be 1 hour so 10 15 and this will be 16 and here it is 3.5 + 1.5 so 3 and 4 so 4 and.5 will be 1 hour which is 5 hours so this total will be 6 hours so 6 hours that is 16 16 + 5 will be 21 hours so superman would have taken 21 hours in order to reach from point A to B. So understood or not? Right? So 10 3 + 2 will be 5 15 half an hour half an hour will be 1 hour. So total is 16 hours. So these two point will be 3.5 1.5 will be 5 hours. So 165 will be 21. So 21 hours will be the total time taken by the superman to reach this distance. I think that's the value whether any other passage has been given other than this. No, I think uh no that's it. The complete passage has been ended here. So I think uh these are the values we found out by using the passage. So now let me move on to the questions what they have given under this passage and we try to solve it. Right? Very interesting. So now let me move on to the questions. I hope uh while writing the test just check where you have made a mistake. In case if you have made a mistake on some of the points, make sure to rectify it. That's the reason I'm saying by just watching the video you will not learn anything right in this data interpretation series. I'm saying that's a 30th video. Already I've posted 29 videos with different different DI. So write the test first. So test always plays a important role to understand your mistakes. So once you write the same question as a test, you could have struggled somewhere else. So now if you watch the video you can learn okay this is the place I struggle so now I'm okay with that. So next time if the question was similar to this you should not make a mistake. So rectify it automatically you will clear if you're going for an any competitive exams right. So basics are more and more needed. So now let me move on to all the five five question how many question they have asked? Okay only four question they have asked three question. Okay. So based upon this passage, so here is the first question. If Batman and Spider-Man travels with the uniform speed and the Batman beats Spider-Man by a distance of 124 kilometers, then what is the speed of the Spider-Man? So friends here our target is to find what is the speed of the Spider-Man right and even in the question also in the passage what they have given also the Spider-Man speed I think it was not given but the Batman speed has been given because the Batman speed will be uh 60 kilometers per I think so 60 km/ hour right so according to the question just now we calculated the value 1 120 so 120 will be the total distance and here the where the Batman speed will be 60 kilometer per hour which was given in the question. So now according to the question we don't know what is the speed of the Spider-Man but they have given one point that Batman right just look at the point Batman beats the Spider-Man by a distance of 124 kilometers. What is the meaning of it? We just now have in the initial uh stage of this video I've told this you have to learn the races concept clearly. There is a separate lesson I have posted on the races which comes under the time and distance topic. So if one person defeats or beats another person by this much of kilometer that means if the first person that is the person Batman right so E could have reached this distance 120 kilometer and what is the speed so time is equals to distance by speed so distance by speed will be 60 kilome per hour. So friends understood or not? What I'm calculating here is the time. So time taken by the Batman to reach 1240 kilometers. So 0 0 cancel it on two table. So this will be three. Cancel it on two table 62. So that means the time taken by the Batman to reach 120 in 62x3 hours. So in the same time in the 62 by 3 hours in the same time where the Spider-Man will be at some distance that distance how will you find because E is the person who is winning the race. Batman is winning the race. So the difference between both the person distance will be 124 kilometer. Why? Because while Batman reaching 1240 the Spider-Man will be 124 kilometer less than the total distance only then we can say while reaching this point where the Batman beats the Spider-Man by 124 km. So when you subtract 124 from here 1 16 kilometer. So now while the Batman reaching the total distance 120 at a time of 62x3 hours in this same time 62x3 hours where the Spiderman will be at the distance of triple 16 kilome only then we can say the Batman defeats the Spider-Man at a distance of 124 kilometer. So this is the concept of the race same time same time but the distance will be different. So the speed will also be different. We already know that the batsman speed is how much? 60 kilometer per hour. So now what is our target? Our target is to find what is the speed of the Spider-Man. We know the kilometer distance. We know the time taken. So time is equal to our target is to find what is the speed. So speed is equal to distance by time. So we can directly calculate the speed here because our target is to find the speed according to the question. So speed is equals to distance by time. So 1 16 / 62 by 3. So this can be written as 1 16 into 3 divided by 62. So I think we can calculate this on 48 4. Okay. Let's cancel this on two table. This will be 31. Right? So once you cancel this on two table 5 2's are 10. So remaining will be 1. Again 5 2's are 10. remaining will be 1 8 2's are 16 so 58 so I think we can cancel again by directly by 31 table so 1 * will be 31 remaining will be 24 that is 248 so 8 times right 8 3's are 24 so 18 8 3's are 24 so remaining will be 2 which will be 54 kilome per hour so finally we found the speed of the Spider-Man will be 54 kilome per hour. So friends, understood or not how I calculated it, right? So just listen carefully. So we know that the Batman time taken, we know the Batman total distance of the destination from A to B is 1 to 4 which we calculated by using the passage and in the initial of the passage they have given the Batman speed as 60 kilome. By using these two data we can easily find out what is the time taken by the Batman to reach this distance which is 62x3 hours. So the same distance Spider-Man also he will be he will be also traveling at the time but where which person wins the race where the Batman wins the race and after what the point what they have mentioned here is the Batman defeats the Spider-Man by 124 kilometer that means the difference between both the person distance will be 124 and he is winning the race he is losing the race so he will be behind some distance which is 124 so I subtracted 124 4 0 minus 124 which will be,16 kilometer. So at the same time this person will be winning the race. At the same time he will be 124 km behind the Batman. So we know the distance we know the time. So distance divided by time will be the speed. So I have calculated 54 kilome per hour. So which will be the speed of the Spider-Man. Right? So this will be the answer for this question. I think similarly the last question also I think it's based upon the same concept right so try to solve it so I will be solving the next question here so here is the second question if superman's car has not been punchured then what is the distance would have been defeated the batsman Batman okay if superman car was not being punchured then okay okay understood the concept so what they are saying is uh in the in the data right we already know that he he had traveled some distance and then he his tire got punchured and the speed has been reduced to 250 50%age so now here what they are saying is in case if the superman car was not punchured then he could have traveled at the same speed because already the superman speed was given in the question which is 80 kilome per hour this was the data they have given in the question and we know that The total distance will be 1240 kilometer. So let's see what is the time taken. So time taken will be 12 4 0 divided by 80. So we can cancel it. 1 18 are 8 8 5 are 40 again five. So here if if the tire right if the superman tire is not if the superman car tire is not punchured then for traveling the total distance 1 to 40 kilometer superman would have taken 15.5 hours right so now what they are saying is what distance he would have beat the Batman similar concept like previous question just now first question I have told you if one person beating the second person or any person then we have to figure out the distance between both the person that is difference between the distance. So now in this 15.5 hours the person Superman would have traveled 1240 same 15.5 hours let's see what is the Batman distance so we know that the Batman traveling will be 60 kilometers per hour. So 15.5 into 16. So which will be 10. 6 5 are 3 30 30 6 5 are 3 930. So here we found out 930 is what? 930 will be the total distance that was traveled by the Batman at the time of 15.5 hours. At the same 15.5 hours, Superman would reach the destination. So that Superman won the distance won the race by a distance of how much? You have to find the difference. So 1 2 4 0 difference of 930. So here we have 70 and here we have 240. So 240 and 70 will be 310. So answer for this question is 310. I think the second question right? Second question I don't have option. Okay. So let's check 300. I hope 310 will be the answer. Right? So answer for this question is 310 because we have to see what is the difference between the distance traveled by both the person in this time he finished the race in the same time where the Batman was 9 at the point of 930 kilometers. So what is the difference between the distance 120US 930 will be 310. So 310 is the difference between the distance where the Superman defeats the Batman at a distance of 310 kilometers which will be the answer for this question. I think the remaining question was not that much difficult. All the values will be like similar to this. I hope you have solved all the remaining questions. In case if you you could not able to solve it. I think the solution was also there in the test series. If you still if you can't able to understand it so tell us in the comment section I will post the remaining question as a video. So again my suggestion is always first write the test right because it's not about the prelims exam if it is a prelims exam first level or first tire exam I won't say this you can first learn and then start practicing that that's the point I would always recommend you on many of the videos but here I'm saying it in a reverse way first write the test and then come and watch this video why because only if you writing the test you can understand which point you are struggling ling so that you if you watch the video and you can able to understand where you are struggling and why you could not able to solve at that point. So you are missing on that concept. So learn that concept and try to rectify that mistake and on the next next DA if you solve it automatically you will get an idea right. So mains exam if you are going for any bank or any competitive CAT exams don't think that their DA is difficult if you are strong on the basics if you are strong on the concept nothing is difficult you can able to solve it in an easy way so friends thank you so much for watching this video I hope you really like it don't forget to purchase the book on Amazon and start practicing all the questions what I've given on the book so thank you so much for watching it bye",unknown
92d-Mx4tIUU,"First of all, thanks for being here in my YouTube channel. So friends, before watching this video, so do not forget to purchase my aptitude quantitative aptitude book on Amazon. In case if it is out of stock, you can directly purchase for the same price at our platform. The link is in the description. So friends, now let me move on to the 29th data interpretation for the mains level competitive exams. Right. So already we have posted 28 tough level DA. So don't forget to watch all the previous videos and then before watching this video first write the test right the same question I have given as a test. So first write the test understand what where you are making a mistake and where you are struggling to solve the question and then come and watch this video. So definitely it will be useful for you. Right. So now let me move on to the 29th DI. So here they have given a table chart and all the values are in terms of percentages and look at the chart values carefully. Previous year that is 2024 uh in one one competitive exam bank exam where we can able to see the data interpretation values were inside the chart was not directly given but all the values are a simplification question. So you have to solve the simplification question and you need to find the answer that will be the exact value of the chart right. So similarly here you can able to see some of the values are the percentage values were not directly given they have given us 80%age of 30%age. So 33.33 percentage of 60%age. So you need to know some of the percentage fraction values. I have already told this learn some of the fraction value like 62.5 percentage 33.33 percentage 14.28 28 percentage right so when you keep on learning all the percentages like decimal point percentage value into a fraction number so definitely you can able to solve most of the questions fastly so here when you take the firstity a right so one value is 80% of 30% so 80%age of 30%age is 24% right so I hope everyone knows it just I can show you how I got 30%age 24 percentage so 80%age of 30%age you can cancel 1 percentage and two zeros here. So 8 3's are 24 percentage. So 80%age of 30%age the answer will be 24 percentage. That means the percentage of auto driver they have given some values in the chart. So first value of city A will be 24%. So similarly you have to calculate for only four datas has been given like that 50%age of 20%age. So 50%age of 20%age is 10 percentage and one value what they have given us 33. So 33.33 percentage of 60. So 33.33%age should be taken as 1x3 fraction value. So 1x3 of 60 percentage. So cancel it resultant will be 20%age. And similarly one value what they have given is 14.28%age. So 14.28% when you convert the percentage into a fraction which will be 1x 7. So 1x 7 can be taken as 14.28. So 14.28 should be written as 1x 7. So 1x 7 into 147. So resultant will be 21%age. So you can able to see city C and the last people who don't have any vehicle will be 21%age. So you have to find first all these percentage value exactly and then when you look at the chart carefully. So when you take the last city city E where the first percentage value is not given but look at all the remaining three values. So remaining three values has been given 15 percentage 30%age and 20 percentage. So when you add all the three 30 20 15 resultant will be 65%age. So we know the total population will be equal to all the sum of all the values. So 100 minus 65 resultant will be 35. So that 35%age will be the city E the percentage of people who have an auto drivers. So this is the way we can find two city value. One is we can find city C as well as city E. These two missing value it is easy to find. But when you take city A and city B and then city D where two values are missing. I think we can't able to find that directly only based upon the question we have to find it. Right? So this is the first step you have to do before solving all the five question what they have mentioned in the chart. So always remember that if you are preparing for any tough level competitive exam. So first target always the time management speed all those things are not needed here. Why? Because it's a mains exam tough level competitive exams. If for a prelims you have to be faster for the mains you have to be very careful on finding each and every value in the question. So that if you find all the values perfectly then solving will just keep trying to solve you know all the basics right you know you are strong on the basics. So definitely you can able to solve the question but be confident that you can right. So definitely you can able to solve it. So now let me move on to all the five question that is based upon this table chart. Question number one. So the total population of B is 20%age more than the total population of A. If the ratio between female to male have a vehicle from A is 2 is to 7 and the female to male having a own vehicle from B is 1 is to 5. So find the ratio between male have a own vehicle from A to male having a own vehicle from B. If the given number of female have from B is 800 more than the female have from A. So I think uh uh first we need to understand this question properly right because uh they are talking about the ratio value has been given our target is to find some ratio value. So now let's let's read the question slowly and understand and we can try to solve the question right. So first the total population of B is 20%age more than A and when you see the chart where the total population of A as well as B was not given because two values are missing but here in this point what they have given is the total population of B is 20%age more than the total population of A. So that means if you consider the population of A as 100%age then the population of B will be 120% because 20%age more. So once you cancel it the resultant value will be 5 is to 6. That means we can take the population of a as 5x and the population of the b is 6x. So 5x and 6x. Now let's consider it as the total population of city a as 5x and city b as 6x. So now next point if the ratio between the female to male have their own vehicle. So have their own vehicle will be the third column. Right? So when you look at the third column what they saying is from a that is from city where the ratio is 2 is to 7. So city the ratio value is 2 is to7 not for male and female I think female and male right the ratio is this value is the female ratio and this value is the male ratio be careful on it and second data what they have given us and the female to male having their own vehicle again the third row and what they said is for city B. So they have given the city B ratio. So people have their own vehicle. So ratio is 1 is to 5. So this value is also female and male ratio. So female and male ratio. Female and male ratio has been given. So these two values they have given for the people who who have their own vehicle. So now what they saying is find the ratio between male who have own vehicle from A. So our target is to find the male value that is 7 by 9 part. Similarly B 5 by six part because this is the male ratio value. So we need to find the total number of male who have the vehicle own vehicle that means 2 is to 7 part female is to male we need to find the male value. So ratio of city A male to city B male. This is the value what we need to find here. And the last point they have given one value is if the given number of females if the given number of female have from B is 800 more than female from A. So what they have said is where if the given number of female have from city B is 800 more than the female have from city A. So if if one value right we already know that the total population of city A is 5X and city B is 6X. So now they have given the difference right what is the difference they have given for the female. So they have given the difference for the female of two city A and B. So I have told this concept many times right if I have 100 rupees and you have 150 rupees. So we can say the difference between both the person is 50 rupees. Yes because I'm having 100 you having 150. So the difference will be 50 rupees. So similarly what they said is if the given number of female from B right city B is 800 more that means the difference between both the cities will be 800 so now what we can do is this is the female not for male it's a female so difference between two city where the female is 800 more that is city A different city B so now what we can find is city B is how much 6X out of the 6X how much females are there 20%age of the female city B you can see the people have their own vehicle so people have their own vehicle from city B is 20%age so 20% out of this 20%age how much of female are there so female will be one so 1 by six difference of similarly let's let's target the first city A so city A total population is 5X out of this 5X people have their own vehicle so people have their own vehicle is 10 percentage so out of total population 10 percentage of the people who have own vehicle. Out of this 10 percentage how much are female? Two part are female. So 2 by 9 part are female which is equals to 800. So friends understood or not? This is the important step of this question. So first try to understand the question. They have given the value 800. So the value 800 what they have mentioned is the total number of females who have their own vehicle from city B is 800 more than from city A that means the difference between both the values. So difference between both the value will be 800. So we know the total population of city B which is 6X out of 6X 20%age of the people who have their own vehicle. Out of this own vehicle we already know that city B one is the female ratio five is the male ratio. So out of six part one part is the female. So this value is what the total number of females from city B who have their own vehicle. So similarly this value will be the total number of females from city A who have their own vehicle. And according to the question they have given the difference between both the value is 800. So this part alone is important in this question. That's it. If you know I think the remaining part will be easy. Why? Because by solving it you can able to find the value of x. So once you find the value of X you can able to find the total population of city A and city B. Once you know the total population finding the male of both the value is easy right. So the the art of the question is this part right? So now let's let we solve this. So we can cancel this five times. I think we can cancel this also right we can cancel this remaining will be x by 5 here. So difference of so here we can cancel it. So this will be 10 * 1 5 are 5 2 5 are 10. So you can cancel two and two here. This will be x by 9 is equals to 800. Right? So just a difference value. Right? So I think this will be 9 x this will be 5x. So 9 x and 5x resultant will be 4x is equals to 800 into 9 5 are 45. So we can cancel it. Resultant will be 200. So x is equals to 9,000. So finally we got the value of X which is 9,000. So by using the value of X you can easily find what is the population of city A and city B because population of city A is 5X and we already got X is equals to 9,000. So 9 into 5 will be 45. So 45,000 will be the population of city A. And similarly what is the population of city B? 96 54. So 54,000 will be the population of city B and population of city A is 45. So now what is the final target? This is not the value what we need to find here. But the final answer what we need to find here is the ratio. So ratio of the male to the female who have their sorry ratio of their male from which city? From city A and the people who have their own vehicle. So we know that 45,000 is from city and the people who have their own vehicle is how much percentage 10 percentage. So first value I'm saying 10 percentage out of this 10 percentage we have to find for the male. So male is how much? 7 by 9. So 7 by 9. So similarly divided by so 54,000 into the total number of females who have their people who have their own vehicle percentage is 20%age. Out of 20 percentage female is one part but our target is to find male. So 20%age that is 20 by 100 into 5 divided by so 6 that's it. So if you cancel the we can cancel 0 0. So 1 2 3 0 1 2 3 0 and we can cancel 1 0 1 0 here. So finally we cancelled most of the values. So now I think uh we can cancel this 9 6 are 54. So similarly we can cancel 9 5 are 45. So we can cancel five and five here. So remaining values what we have in the numerator is 7 and the denominator value what we have is 9 into 2 is 18 I think uh 9 7 is to 18 yes so 7 is to 18 is the value what we got as the answer for the first question right so friends I hope you understood the concept of the question right here again I'm saying speed is not at all important Right? Don't don't try to solve the question so fastly in your mains exam. So our target is to get the final answer correctly. That should be your aim and that should be your goal if you are going for a competitive at second level of competitive exam. I'm saying like bank mains exam or any UPSC exams you have to get the final answer correctly. That should be a target speed is not at all important here because these questions will not be asked in the prelims exam. These are the questions that they are going to ask in the mains level exam. So you have to be confident and you should know how to write this equation part alone. That is important. So this will be the answer for the first question. Question number two. So the percentage of taxi drivers from city A is 20%age more than the people who don't have any vehicle from that city. So be careful right in the previous question was also the same sentence but there are talking about the total population. So total population of city B is 20 percentage more than city A. So we consider the total population of city B as 100 and city A as 120. But the same thing you should not do here. Why? Because they are talking about city A particular percentage of people they are comparing the difference. So you should not take 100 and 120. You should take it as just see percentage of taxi driver. So in from city A the taxi driver value was not given as well as the total number of people who don't have any vehicle that is also not given. Both the values are not given here. So now what they saying is the percentage of taxi driver from A is 20%age more than the total number of people who don't have any vehicle. So first let's consider the people who don't have any vehicle is as X. So why I'm considering it as X? Because this value is missing. So you should not consider at 100%. Why? Because if you consider this as 100% then this becomes the total population. But here according to the question the value is missing. So I have considered it as X. So now sum the same city the total taxi drivers are 20%age more. So let's consider this as 120%age of X. So this will be X and this will be uh 6X by 5. So 6x 5 will be the total taxi drivers and x will be the total people who don't have any vehicle. And the next point what they have given us is and the value the sum of the people who don't have any vehicle and the people who are taxi driver is equals to 66%. Just now we found both the values. So now what they are saying is the sum of two value is equals to 66%. So let's find the value of x here. So this will be 5x 6x is equals to 66 percentage into 5 because I have taken LCM here. So this will be 11 x. So uh when you 11 x cancel this 66 which becomes 6. So friends understood or not 11 x is equals to 66% into 5. So cancel this 6. So x is equals to 30%. So finally we got the value x is equals to 30%. That means the total number of people who don't have any vehicle is 30%age. So now we can easily find the total number of people who are the taxi drivers because taxi drivers will be the remaining 36%. We know the total sum is 66. So by using that value we figure out what is the total number of people who don't have any vehicle which is 30 and the total number of taxi driver is 36%. So that the sum becomes 66%age. Right? So now the next point what they have given us the difference between the total taxi drivers and the total auto drivers is 5,400. So 5,400 they have given us the difference. We already know that from CTA the total auto driver percentage is how much? 24%age and the total taxi driver is how much? Just now we found 36%age and what they have said here is the difference between both the value is 5,400. So we can find 12 percentage 1 percentage will be 12 4 are 48. So remaining will be 6 450. So if 1 percentage is 450 then what about 100%? So 100%age will be 45,000. So why I calculated 100% because 100%age will be the total population. So now I found by using this value the total population of city A which will be 45,000. So 45,000 is the total people who are from city A. So friends understood or not? By using the first value we found what is the total number of taxi drivers and then by using the second data what they have given in a question we found what is the total population of city A. But what is the target here is to find the total population of city B. Just look at the question find the total population of city B. So we need to find what is the total population of city B. But what they have given is if the total number of auto and taxi drivers in city B is 10,800 more than the total auto drivers from city A. Okay. So from city A auto drivers add 10,800 that value will be the resultant auto and taxi drivers of cityb. So what we can do here is first we can find from CTE how much of auto drivers are there from CTA what is the total number of auto drivers which is 24 percentage and we know that the total population of CTA is 100%age. So now we can find out of this 45,000 what is 24 percentage because if you find what is 24 percentage then it is easy to find out the total number of auto drivers from city. So which will be now 24 into 450. So this will be a zero. So 45 5 4 are 22 5 2 are 10 120 10,800. So now what we found here is 24 percentage is the total number of taxi drivers. Right? So total number of taxi drivers from city is 10,800. So now what they are saying in the question is from city B the total auto drivers plus total taxi drivers are 10,800 more than the taxi drivers sorry the auto drivers of city. So again 10,800 more when you add another 10,800 year which will be 21,600. So 21,600 is the total number of drivers who are from cityb that is auto and taxi and when you look at the chart value carefully the city B city B the values are missing but the remaining two value people who don't have any vehicle is 40%age people have their own vehicle is 20%age so 60%age so remaining is what 40%age so definitely these two value will be the remaining 40%age so 40%age is equals to 21,600. So our target is to find what is the total population of cityb. So 100%age is equals to x. So now we can cancel 0 0 here. So 4x is equals to 2160 into 100. So I think easily we can cancel it. 1 4's are four. So this will be 25 *. So x is equals to 2160 into 25. So 0 25 into 200 25 into 200 will be 50 4 64 25 6 will be 54,000 that's it so finally we can say that this will be the total population of CTP which is 54,000 right so friends understood or not how we found the answer see be slow First understand each and every point of the question and try to find out the value. So initially first what we did is we have found the total sum has been given which is 66%age and from city A both the values are not given. So we found the city A people who don't have any vehicle as X and the taxi drivers are 6x 5. So the summation will be 66%age. These are the value they have given in the question. So by using it we have found what is the total number of people who don't have vehicle which is 30%age and the total number of taxi driver is 36%age and the next point they have given the difference between both the values 5,400 by using this I have found what is 1 percentage if 1 percentage is 450 100%age will be 45,000 so this will be the total population of city so now what they have we need to find what we need to find in the question here is we need to find what is the total population of city B and they have given a small clue that the from the city B where the total auto and taxi drivers are 10,800 more then from city A of the total auto drivers so I have found city A total population auto drivers are 10,800 add another 10,800 that will be resultant equals to auto and taxi drivers of city B and how I found this 40%age Because if these two values are missing in the chart, the remaining two value if I add the values in the chart which is 60. So if the remaining two values are 60%age, then the missing two value will be 40%age. So 40%age is equals to 21,600. 100%age I've calculated in order to find the total population of cityb. So total population of cityb which is 54,000. Next question. So if the ratio between the total population of city C to city E is 8 is to 9 and the total people without any vehicle from city E are 960 more than that of in city C again. So you can able to see the word 960 more similar like previous two question. I think similar question was asked as a last question also which is looks similar to this concept. So if you solve this question the last fifth question is easy. So now what they said is our target is to find the average of auto drivers in both the city that is from city C and city E. So here they are talking about only two city C and city E and initially they have given the total population of both the cities are in a ratio 8 is to 9. So we can consider directly because they have given the values directly here 8X as city C and 9X as city E. So this is the ratio value they have given. So let's consider it as 8X and 9X. So now what they saying is the total people without having any vehicle from city E is 960 more than of city C. That means city E and city C the difference will be 960. So 960 is just a difference the comparison is city and the city C. So and the people who don't have any vehicle. So from CTC let's let's see the chart value. So CTC where the people who don't have any vehicle is 20%age. So we know that CTE the total population is 9X out of this 9X 20%age of the people who don't have any vehicle. And similarly the difference of the second city that is city C. So CTC the total number of people who don't have any vehicle is 21 percentage. So 21 by 100 which is equals to 960. So first initially let's find the value of X like what we did in the previous question. First find the value of X. After finding the value of X we can able to find what is the total population of city C and city E. So based upon the value our target is to find the average that we can find out easily. So now we can cancel this 9 2 are 80 180x minus of 168x is equals to 9,600 sorry 960 into 100. So this will be 12x is equ= to 960 into 100. So we can cancel 12 8 times. So x is equals to 8,000. So finally we got the value of x is equals to 8,000. That means the city E the total population will be 64,000 because 88s are 64. So 64,000 is the total population of city E. Then 98 are 72. So 72,000 will be the total population of city E. So now what is our target? Our target is to find the average of total autod drivers in both the cities. Either you can find divide two directly while calculating the value or else at last you can divide by two that is your wish. So finally what this we need to find is the auto drivers from both the city that is from city C and city E. Okay so city C the total auto drivers will be 38%age and what about city E? City E we already know that initially initial of this video I've told that right because from city E where all the three values has been given. So finding the last value is easy because add all the value 30 20 15 will be 65%age. So 65%age minus of 100%age resultant will be 35. So 35 will be the total percentage of people who are an auto drivers. So 35%age. So now we need to find the average for both. So this will be for city E and this will be for city C. So now C and E. So find the average of total taxi drivers in both the cities. So where the first value? Okay. So, which is 35%. So, now we need to find the average. So, we already know that C is how much? 64,000. So, out of this 64,000, we have to find what is 38%age. So, plus second value, which is 72,000. Out of this 72,,000 we have to find what is 35%age and we have to completely divide by two. So, either you can divide by two here or else you can divide by two at last. It's completely our wish. So we can cancel 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 zeros here. So 640 this will be 320 here I have divided by 2. So similarly 720 this will be 360 into 35. So all the values I have just divide by two here itself. So that for the easy calculation. So 32 38 8 3's are 24 30 31. So remaining will be 3 9 1 2 1 6 and similarly 36 35 33 18 15 23 26 2 1 160 0 24 760. So final answer of this question is 24,760. So which will be the average of the total autodrivers from both the cities. So this will be the answer for this question. Right? So I think the important part of this question again framing this equation right how to frame this equation and all the values are mostly directly given in the question. So by using all the values what they have given in the question we have found the answer right so this will be the answer for question number three and I think the last question is also similar kind of model. So last question is something around 63 64 uh percentage ratio value has been given. A similar concept difference value will be given. Our target is to find the total population of some of the city. That will be the answer for the last question. Fourth question. So the total population of D is 40%age more than that of A. So find the number of taxi drivers and the people without any vehicle together from A are approximately what percentage of total number of auto driver and people who don't have any vehicle together from D. Okay. So here our target is to find approximately what percentage that means we need to find X is what percentage of Y X by Y into 100. So the value of x will be the total number of taxi drivers and people who don't have any vehicle from city and similarly the denominator is same from cityd. So the initially they have given the value that the total population of city d is 40%age more than that of city. So if city is 100 then city will be 140 right because 40%age more. So let's consider city as 100%. So city D okay so city D will be 40%age more resultant will be 140%age so if you cancel it so this will be 5x and this will be 7x so 5x is to 7x will be the total population of city A as well as uh city D so now what they are saying is we need to find what is the total number of taxi drivers and the people who don't have any vehicle from city A when you look at the chart carefully taxi driver value is missing as well as the people who are not having any vehicle that is also missing. Both the values are missing but the remaining two values what 24 percentage and 10 percentage. So 24 percentage and 10 percentage will be 34%age. So from 100 right from 100 if you subtract 34%age resultant will be 66% right. So we have to find from the total population 5x what is 66 percentage because if you find this value these two values are what so total percentage of people who are and taxi drivers as well as people who don't have any vehicle that is from city A. So divided by so city D will be 7x into so city D what are all the values A b C D 4 again 25 percentage and 26 percentage so when you add both the value resultant will be 20 25 40 51 right 51 percentage so 51 percentage into 100 so understood or not how I found it so 5x is the total population of city A and total population of city D will be 7X out of 5X so this 66%age where 34%age is the auto drivers and the people have their own vehicle so from total 100%age if I subtract this resultant percentage will be the total number of taxi drivers plus and the total number of people who don't have any vehicle resultant will be 66%age so next will be cityd sod 7x into so what they get is that what is The percentage of total auto drivers oh auto drivers and total vehicle from CTD sorry A B C D so 25 26 will be 51 percentage so from 100 if you subtract 51 percentage remaining will be 49 so we need to find what is 49% just see what percentage of total number of auto drivers and people have their own vehicle so those two values are not given in the chart so what I did is I have added the remaining values so remaining value is 25 and 26 6 which is 51. So 100 - 51 will be 49% of 7 x. So we can cancel percentage percentage here. We can cancel x and x here. So we need to find an approximate answer right. So let's let's take it as 9 7 are 63 right approximate value. Similarly this will be 9 5 are 45. Here we have remaining four. And here we have a remaining three. 97s are three. So 3x 4. 3x 4 will be around we can cancel. So 3x 4. So 3x 4 will be around 0.9 something. So we can go with an approximate as 96. Right? Because based upon the options right if all the options are nearer to 96 95 94 then we can find an exact answer and then we can go with the options. So based upon the options but I just gradually calculated it I'm getting an answer in the range of 96%age right so which will be the answer for this question. So friends totally the last question I have told you which is similar to the previous question right. So here all the five question are not so difficult but understanding the question is the most important part of the most of the highlevel competitive exams. The question will be easy if you know the concept, if you know how to find the ratio value, if you know how to find the percentage value, the question will be very very easy. But understanding the question and what we need to find out from the question, you have to figure those things properly. Right? That comes only when you practice. So that's the reason I'm saying first write the test and then come and watch this video that will be definitely helpful for you. Right? So friends, thank you so much for watching this video and uh see you soon on the next video. So, thank you so much.",unknown

w74KP-C6h-g,"First of all, thanks for being here in my YouTube channel. So friends, if you are a regular follower of my channel. So do not forget to purchase my book quantitative aptitude book and start solving all the question what I have given in this book. Right? Because each and every question it's an art level question. Nowadays our competitive exam level or keep on increasing. So practice all the questions what I have given inside this book. If you have any doubt on purchasing it, do not forget to watch this video. In the unboxing video, I have told you what are all the topics are there and where to buy this book everything. So, if you are a regular follower of feel free to learn, do not forget to purchase this book on our platform. So, now let me move on to the video. First of all, thanks for being here in my YouTube channel. So, today in this video, we will be solving an important question on the topic time and work. So for this year IBBS clerk exam so many students were asking about this time and work topic simple interest component interest because nowadays in the prelims exam where the data interpretation was little bit medium level so students can't able to solve that in time. So now they are targeting time and work time and distance simple interest component interest question in the prelims exam. So here I have a list of question which are important concept by referring previous year question papers of IBBS clerk. So what are all the concept question they have asked from the previous year. I've just collected all those question and then here I have prepared 30 questions here that I'm going to teach in this video. Those are most important for upcoming IBBS clerk exam. So do one thing take a note and paper by watching this video simultaneously you two try to solve the question so that you you could have easily learn and you can understand where you are making a mistake and where you are struggling to solve everything will automatically comes if you watching the video by watching the video if you simultaneously solve the question. So now just take a pen and paper let me move on to all the important question on the topic time and work. So here is the first question. If a man or a woman or three boys can complete a piece of work in 121 days, how many days will a man, a woman and a boy together will complete a work? So our target is to find one man, one woman and one boy. If all the three person are working, how many days it takes to complete the work and what are all the datas they have given initially is a man or two women or three boy can complete a piece of work in 121 days. So I think the easy way to solve the question is by comparing men, women and children separately by taking one man how much days he can complete one woman how much days one children how much days and then if you add all the three value resultant will be all the three person working together how many days they take to complete a work just see we can solve it fastly. So we know that one man can complete a piece of work in 121 days. Similarly, two women can complete a piece of work in 121 days and three children, right? So, three boys can complete a piece of work in 121 days. Just listen carefully. We already got one man. Now, we should get one woman. So, bring this two to the denominator. So, 1 women is equals to 1 by 2 into 121. Don't multiply this number. If you multiply this number, taking an LCM will be a tricky one. So, better keep the number as it is. So, here also 3 equal to 1x 121. bring three to the denominator. So 1 divided by 3 into 121. So now we got one man, one woman and one boy. Our target is to find if all the three person are working, how much time it takes. So better we can add all the three value 121 plus 1 divided by 2 into 121 + 1 / 3 into 121. So now we have to take the LCM value fastly. So the easy way is in all the three values we have 121 common yes or no. So better take 121 outside. Now it will be easy right? So once you take 121 outside the resultant value will be 1 by 1. So plus 1 by 2 plus 1 by 3. So now 3 and 2 the LCM will be 6 here. So here we have six and here we have three and here we have two. So finally 121. So final answer will be 121 into so 6 + 5 will be 11. So 11 divided by 6. So we can cancel it 11 times. So 1 by 66. That means if all the three person are working together the total work will be completed in 66 days. Easy or not? So very easy right? Uh if you solve it in your exam you you can just like that solve within 30 seconds. It's possible right? In order to understand this all I have written here but in your exams you don't want to write it by just seeing the question one man equal to 121 two women so one woman equal to 1x 2 into 121 so three boy one boy equal to 1x 3 into 121 do not multiply these values if you multiply these value definitely by taking an LCM you might be wasting more than a minute to take an LCM alone so better don't take multiply the numbers better keep the number as it is at last you will get a huge number as a common in all the terms like what we got 121 121 121 so take 121 outside so 1x 1 1x2 1x3 so take LCM 6 year 3 year 2 year so total numerator is 11 11x 6 into 1x 121 so 11 and 121 is just when once you cancel it it will be 11 so 11 into 6 will be 66 so answer for this question if all the three person are working the work will be completed in 66 days So here is the second question. A and B together can do a piece of work in 18 days. So B and C together 27 days. C and A together is 54 days. In how many days? If all the three person working together to complete 50%age of the work. So our target is to find if all the three person are working they has to complete only 50%age of the work. So how much time it takes for these kind of question? Do one thing right? First find to complete 100%age of the work how much days he is taking and after getting the final answer calculate what is 50%age of the number that is the easy way to solve the question because some students what they used to do is while solving a question itself they apply 50% 50%age everywhere in finding the answer don't do it if you do it some cases you may get the answer wrongly so the better is in at the last if question is like this in your exam at the last if they are saying find 30%age of the work done find 20%age of the work first find what is 100% after getting the final answer then find what is 50%age of the work right so now A and B can complete a piece of work in 18 days so A and B will be 1 by 18 so what about B and C so B and C can complete a piece of work in 27 days similarly C and A can complete a piece of work in 54 days and we know the logic right so we already learned this concept. If you if you add all the three equation, let's assume 1 2 and three equation. So once you add this equation, a and a will be 2 a. So 2 b + 2 c is equals to let's add all the value 1x 18 1x 27 1x 54. So now I think if you want to take LCM be a little bit faster just see the larger number. Larger number here is 54 and 54 is a multiple of 27. 54 is a multiple of 18. 18 3es are 57. 27 2's are 54. Right? So 54 will be the LCM here. So the first you have to target the larger number and check whether this larger number is a multiple of the remaining number. Yes. So 18 into 3 27 into 2 and 1. So resultant will be 6 / 54. So here we have 2 of a + b + c. So a + b + c is equals to bring the two to the denominator or else you can cancel here itself. You can cancel 1 2's are 2 3 2's are 6. So 1 3's are 3. So 1 3's are 3 remaining will be 2 24 8 3's are 24. So now now just check what is the final answer we got here is if all the three person are working together they take 18 days to complete the work. Yes or no? They take 18 days to complete the work which is 100%age of the work. So the total work they took 18 days to complete it. But what is our answer? What we need to get here is if they have to do only 50%age of the work how many days it takes? Just find what is 50%age of the number which is 9 days. So now 50%age is nothing but one by two half of the work. So half of 18 days will be nine days. So in order to do 50%age of the work they will take 9 days to complete. So it is the easy way to solve the question. I have seen many students usually they find what is 50% 50%age don't do it right. It's difficult to find the answer if you multiply 50 in all the values. So better if you find a question like this in your exam find what is 30%age of the work done. Find what is 20%age of the work done if all the three person are working. If you find a question like this, find what is 100%. After finding the final answer, from the final answer, check what is 50%age of the number. That will always be the easy and the best way to solve this question. So now answer for this question is 9 days. Here is the third question. So A and B together can complete a piece of work in 48 days. A is four times efficient than B. So efficiency based concept question everyone knows it the first video itself on the topic time and work. I have thought how to convert the efficiency what is called as efficiency efficiency ratio and time ratio both the ratio plays a major role in the topic time and work efficiency ratio reciprocal reverse reciprocal or reverse which is called as a time ratio. So here what they are saying is A is four times efficient than B. So if you write it in a efficiency ratio for A is to B where A is four times efficient. That means if B is doing one part of work A will be completing four part of the work because A is that much efficient. When you convert into time the same efficiency ratio which will be reciprocal 1 is to 4. The meaning is if B takes 4 days to complete a work A will be taking only 1 days to complete. Only one day he will take but B takes four days because that's a efficiency. A will be working faster when compared to B. How much time? Four times. So now this can be written as X and this will be 4X. Always while adding the value you should write the value only in terms of time ratio not in terms of efficiency ratio. 99%age of the question the efficiency efficiency value should be converted into time and then only you have to find how many days they take to complete a work. So here finally we have assumed A take X days to complete a work. B takes 4x days to complete a work. So now according to the question if both a person are working they will take 48 days to complete a work. That means if A and B both are working they are taking 48 days to complete a work. So A how many days X days? 1x B how many days? 4x is equals to 1x 48. So now let's take LCM as 4x here. We don't have four. So multiply by four here. We already have 4x here just only 1 is equals to 1 by 48. So I think we can cancel it. 1 4 are 4. So this will be 12. 4 + 1 will be 5. So 5 into 12 will be 60. So finally we got x is equals to 60. That means this is not the final answer. Right? We got the value of x= to 60. That means x will complete a piece of work in 60 days. Now what is our target to find? Our target to find alone. How many days it takes to complete a work? If A alone takes 60 days, the then B will be 60 into 4 240 days. So B will be taking 240 days to complete a piece of work. A will be taking only 60 days. Now according to the question they are just asking only about B. So the answer for this question is 240 days. Right? Easy question. You can go with the mind calculation. Remember one thing uh you should always be careful what is called as an efficiency ratio. How to convert efficiency ratio into time ratio. So these two target these two concept are most important target and solve more number of question that is based on efficiency and time. I think I I do have here in this video more. So you too after watching this video try to solve more number of question that is based on a concept of efficiency as well as time. So finally answer for this question number three where B alone can complete a piece of work in 240 days. Next question. So A can do 1x4th of the work in 9 days. B can do 2x3 of the work in 28 days. In how many days A and B takes to complete the work working together. See the concept is very simple. I we we our target is to find if both the person are working how many days they take to complete a work. But the simple logic here in the first point what they have mentioned is A take 1x4th of the work 1x4th of the work to be completed in 9 days. So the meaning here is E takes 1x4 for doing out of that work right some work is there out of that work e completed 1x4th in how many days 9 days this is the value what they have given for A. So the meaning here is so A will be completing the total one work will be 36 days. Yes or no? Because if he is completing 1x4th of the work in 9 days then the total one work will be completed in 36 days. So A alone can complete a piece of work in 36 days. So similarly they have given the value for B. So B alone can complete the 2x3 of the work right? We don't know how much what work he is doing but out of that work 2x3 of the work is completed in 28 days. So now B alone can complete a piece of work in 28 into 3x2. So once you cancel it resultant will be 14. So 14 into 3 will be 42 days. So finally A alone can complete a piece of work in 36 days. B alone can complete a piece of work in 42 days. So now if both the person are working how many days it takes to complete a work. So until then every student will be feeling easy. Yes it is easy right? We can find it easily. But taking an LCM part is the main tricky part for many students. Right? So here the LCM will be 1x 32 1x 36 1x 42. Right? So the easy way is do not sit and multiply the number. what we did like first question in the first question what we did we have taken some number common outside so that we get a smaller number to take an LCM so similarly 36 42 so by looking at the number itself we can find these two numbers are a multiples of six so here what I can do is I can take 1x 6 common so resultant will be 1x 6 and 1x 7 so when yes or no right because 6 7s are 42 6 are 36 so now taking an LCM will be easy because 6 + 7 divided by 13 year. So 6 + 7 will be 13 divided by 6 3's are 18 remainder will be 1. So 18 + 18 98 I think is 6 42 see I have made a mistake here so it is 42. So 6 2's are 12 remaining will be 1 24 25. So finally if all the two person only two person are there if two person are working the total work will be completed in 252 by 13 days which will be the answer for this question. Ive did a mistake here numerator we added two numbers denominator we should multiply it. So 67s are 42 instead of writing 42 I have just added in the denominator. Right? So always remember that the question in your exams in the prelims exam will be little bit easy but the problem is you should solve the question in a simplest way like taking an LCM part and multiplying the value. You should keep the number as it is. Do not waste your time on multiplication. If you multiply the number taking LCM will be takes time right 15 seconds or some seconds will you will wasting the time in the exam only for taking an LCM. So better is always if you find a number like this try to figure out the LCM directly. If not no problem just take the common number outside what I did here. 6 and 7 we have now cross multiply it. 6 + 7 will be 13. 67s are 42 and 42 into 6 numerator will be 13. So finally we always reciprocal the number at last in time and work in order to find if both the this is 1 day work. So the total work will be completed in 252 by 13 days. Fifth question. So A and B can complete a work in 24 days and 40 days respectively. So they work together for 8 days. So C completes the remaining work in 14 days. How many days A and C working together can complete 75%age of the work. Just now I have told you I think second or third question I have told you this. So we have to find if A and C working together in order to complete 75%age of the work how much time they take. Just listen carefully if you find this question do not find 75%age first find for for completing 100%age of the work A and C alone taking how much days? If you find that value then solving the entire question is easy. So here if the concept is based on some person joining at some point because you can see A and B can complete a piece of work they work together for 8 days. C completes the remaining work in 14 days. That means A and B are working for 8 days. After 8 days the remaining work that was completed by C in 14 days. So our target to initially find C alone how many days E will takes to complete a work. Once you find the value of C you can add A and C alone. how many days they can complete 100%age of the work. After a and c finding 100%age find out of that answer what is 75 percentage. That's it. It's a simple logic to solve a question. See first A alone 24 days B alone 40 days. So let's find A and B what they have worked for 8 days because they are working for 8 days right? So 1 divided by 24 and 1 divided by 40. So A and B. So this can be written as 1 by 24 + 1 by 40. So these will be into 8. So totally they are working for don't bring this eight to the denominator right because they are doing 8 days work. So into 8. So now I think we can take LCM as or we can cancel it or we can directly take LCM as 120 here resultant will be 5 * 3 * into 8. So again numerator we are getting 8 divided by 120 into 8. So we can cancel it on four table. So this will be 30 if you cancel it on four table. So this will be 2 * 1 and 15. So finally 8 by 15 is the total work that was completed by A and B in 8 days. So in 8 days A and B completed 8 by 15 of the work. Then what is the remaining work they have is 1 - 8 by 15 resultant will be 7 by 15. 7 by 15 is what the remaining work and this 7 by 15th of the work remaining work that was completed by C in how many days 14 days so where out of total work where C completed only 7 by 15th of the work in how many days he takes 20 14 days is 14 days he takes so total work that was completed by C we can cancel 2 * 30 so C alone can complete a work in 30 days. Now we already know that A alone can complete a piece of work in 24 days. B alone can complete a piece of work in 40 days. So now our target is to find if A and C working together they has to complete 75%age of the work. So A is how much? 24 1x 24 C C is how much? 1 by 30. Again I think we can take LCM as 120 here. So this will be 5 * this will be four times. So 9 divided by 120. So finally they can complete a piece of work in 120 by 9 days but now they has to do only 75%age of the work into 75 by 100. This is always again I'm saying this will be the easy way to solve the question. At any point do not find 75%age on any of these value. If you find it solving the question will be difficult and there are more chance of making a mistake. Right? So these are the steps actually not required in the exam just to understand the question solving method I'm writing all these step in their exams try to be little bit faster right so first we found A and B 8 days work remaining work this work was completed by C in 14 days so C alone can complete a work in 30 days so now A and C both the person are working they will be completing the work in 120 by 9 days but this is the 100%age of the work but our target to find only 75%age so 75 by 100. If you cancel it on 25 table, so this will be 3x 4. If you cancel it on four, this will be 30. If you cancel this three and if you cancel 30, 10 days. That means if A and C alone working only to do 75%age of the work, it takes only 10 days to complete the work. Which will be the answer for question number five. So here is the sixth question. So A can paint a house in 55 days. B can paint a house in 66 days along with C they can complete a job in 12 days. So then C alone how many days takes to complete a work. Very simple question right? So A alone this much of day B alone this much of day and C was not given our target is to find C alone how many days it takes to complete the work but they have given all three the entire question is easy and solving is also easy but LCM part again for solving these kind of question in your exam it's easy but for some students they feel difficult on taking an LCM value alone so just see here A alone can complete a piece of work we we know that all the three person right A B C all the three person can complete a piece of work in 12 days. So now the A value has been given. A alone will complete the piece of work in 1x 55. So similarly B alone can complete a piece of work in 66 days. But actually the C value is unknown. We have to find C alone how many days he takes to complete a work. But listen here now taking an LCM here we have 12 66 55. So again the easy way is just look at any common numbers common multiple numbers here 66 55 12 12 we can't find 66 is not a 12 multiple 55 is also not a 12 multiple but when you look at the numbers carefully 55 and 66 so both the numbers are a multiples of 11 so what I'm going to do is for these two numbers alone I will be taking 11 outside if I take 11 outside so 1x 5 + 1 by 6. So now taking an LCM remaining value remains as it is no change in the remaining value. So now our target to find the LCM fastly. So now 6 and 5 will be 30. Numerator 6 + 5 will be 11. So finally we got 1x 11 into 11 by 30. So plus 1x is equals to 1x 12. So now we can cancel 11 and 11 here. So 1x is equals to 1x 12 minus of 1x 30. So now we can take LCM here as 60. So this will be five times. This will be two times. So 3 divided by 60 resultant will be 1 by 20. That means C alone will be completing the piece of work in 20 days. So the question solving everything is easy. But remember one thing taking an LCM part from this step to this step do not waste more than 30 seconds for finding LCM alone. I have seeing people more number of students are wasting the time in the exams. So do one thing in the topic time and work while practicing itself. So mainly try to focus on the huge numbers initially for taking LCM bigger numbers right so bigger numbers and that number is a multiple of all the remaining numbers or not. If it is not a multiple then second choice take any number common outside then finding an LCM will be easy. So just see what I did here is 55 66 I found both the numbers are multiples of 11. So I will be taking 11 outside. So remaining I got a smaller one-digit number five and 6. So taking five and six LCM is easy just cross multiply 6 + 5 divided by 30. We can cancel 11 and 11. So remaining we will be getting 1x 30. Bringing a 1x 30 towards right hand side minus 1x 30 and we got the answer as 20 days easy. So always practice like this to solve these kind of question easily. Seventh question. So B would have take 10 days 10 hours more than A. What they have taken to complete a task if each of them worked alone working together they can complete a task in 12 hours. How many hours B would take 50%age of the task. again sorry I think I've read something wrongly initially what what exactly they are saying is B would have taken 10 hours more than what A did for example if A is completing a work in 20 hours B could have complete the work in 30 hours because he is taking 10 hours more than A and another point what they have given is if both the person are working they will be completing the total work in 12 hours our target is to find how many hours B take to do 50%age of the task task again at last we need to find B 50%age of the task what you need to do we have solved more number of question like this always find B 100%age of the task how much time it takes after finding the final answer from the final answer find what is 50%age of the number so here according to the question if A is taking X days B will be taking X + 10 days yes or no because they have mentioned it already. So B is taking 10 days 10 hours more than A. So let's assume if X is for A then B will be X + 10. If both the person are working they will be completing the task in 12 hours. So A will be 1x B will be 1x + 10 is equals to 1x 12. So be careful on taking LCM here. If you can you can take LCM or else better cross multiply it. If you cross here this will be x + 10 and if you cross this number this will be x divided by x into x + 10 numerator. So 2 x + 10 / x into x + 10 is equals to 1 by 12. Yes or no? Because x + x will be 2x and remaining we have 10 here. So x into x + 10. So what you can do here is you can multiply these two numbers you can cross multiply it or else you can take some number common if we if we can able to cancel it. I think we here we can't able to cancel this number. So the better way is we can cross multiply the numbers. So 12 into 2 will be 24x. So this will be 120 is equals to x into x will be x² and x into 10 will be 10 x. So finally we got I think we will be getting a quadratic equation x² - 24x. So 120 if you bring this towards right hand side it will be - 110 is equals to 0 I think. Yes. So 12 are 24 120 x² + 10 x sorry this will be 10 x. So 10 x 24x will be 14x see how much mistake I'm doing here. Right. So this will be 120. Yes. So finally we got a quadratic equation. So now we need to solve this quadratic equation. It's easy right? Because if you are preparing for a bank exam most probably everyone knows how to solve a quadratic equation. So 120. So I think 26 120 but our target to get minus4. So - 20 + 6 while taking outside it will be a positive value. Change the sign. So one x value will be + 20. Another x value will be min - 6. - 6 will not be considered here because most probably minus will not be taken in time and work. So time and work always we consider the positive value. So positive value what we got here is 20. That means the value of x is equal to 20. So we already assumed a as x days. So now a alone can complete a piece of work in 20 days. So b will be completing in 30 days. But this is not the final answer. Our target is to find what is 50%age of the work from the total thing. So if we complete 100%age of the work in 30 days then only 50%age of the work which is half of the work that will be completed in 15 days. So finally answer for the question is 15 days. So friends understood or not right. So this is the way we can solve the question. If we have any numbers mostly we in this two to three years when you look in IBSPO or clerk SBA clerk etc where we can able to see most of the time and work question in the exams they are like uh getting a quadratic equation and then we getting the final answer. Most of the question are like that. So practice more number of question like this. If one person is x another person will be x - 10. So those cases question like partnership we will be getting it. So one person is investing x month next person will be investing 8 months more than the person a. So we assume it as x + 8 similar concept right? So and then we will be getting a quadratic equation. So do not solve like what I mistake what I made here. So practice more so that you will not make this kind of mistake. Right? So answer for this question is 15 days. Eighth question. A and B can together complete a task in 18 hours. After 6 hours, A leaves. So B takes 36 hours to finish the rest of the task. How many hours would A have taken to do the task if E is working alone. So very interesting question just see here. Initially they have given one value A and B alone can complete a piece of task in 18 18 hours, right? So A and B equal to 1 by 18. And what is another value they have given is after 6 hours A leaves. So that means the person A is initially working for 6 hours and then A is leaving the work. B takes 36 hours to finish the rest of the task. How many hours would A have taken to do the task? If he is working alone in case if A alone is working in order to complete the total task, how much days it takes. So first what they have mentioned is after 6 hours A leaves that means initially both the person will be working for 6 hours. After 6 hours the A is leaving and then the remaining work that was done by B alone in how many days? 36 oh sorry 36 hours every value has been given an hours. So first what we can do is both the person initially they are working for 6 hours. So into 6 resultant will be 1 divided by 3. So 1 by3 is the work that was completed by A and B in 6 days. What about the remaining work? So from the total work when you subtract the work what they have done. So resultant will be 2x3. So 2x3 is what the remaining work. So remaining work is 2x3 and this remaining work was completed by B alone in 36 hours. So how you need to write it? So from the total work only 2x3 of the work that was completed by B in how many hours? 36 hours. So 1 2's are 2. So this will be 18 2 are 36 again work is equals to 54. So that means B alone can complete a piece of work in 54 hours. And now A alone finding is easy because our target is to find if A alone is working how many days he takes. So now we found B alone taking 54 days to complete a work. So substitute here we know that A and B equal to 1x8. So we have to find it for A. So B alone complete a piece of task in 54 days is equals to 1x8. So A is equals to 1 by 18 minus of 1 divided by 54. So I think uh three times taking LCM again LCM is 54. target the bigger number and check whether that bigger number is a multiple of all the remaining numbers 54 yes it's a multiple of 18 so 18 threes are 54 so 54 will be the LCM year 18 into 3 minus of 1 so 2 / 54 is equals to 1 divided by 27 that means 27 days or hours all the values are in hours right 27 hours so a alone will be completing this work in 27 hours it's very simple question but I I have seen while teaching this to my friends they asked me a doubt how you consider both the person are working 6 hours initially because when you look at the question carefully A and B together they can complete a piece of work in 18 days after 6 hours A leaves that is the point they have initially mentioned they didn't said that A and B both the person are working for 6 hours and then A leaves that point was not mentioned they just directly mentioned that A leaves after 6 hours. So my friends usually ask how you consider both the person are working for 6 hours. Whether a alone is working for 6 hours and then whether he left the job. It's it's a right question. So I have seen many question on time and work like this. So we have to consider that both the person are working initially if the data was not given like this. So they have given A and B can complete a piece of work in 18 days. after working 6 hours a left. That means we have to assume that both the person are working for 8 hours sorry 6 hours and then only A lives that's the reason I have written A and B totally 18 hours they take to complete a work both the person working for 6 hours 6 hours work done remaining work remaining work that was done by B in 36 hours B alone 54 hours so we know B will be 54 A will be 1x total work will be 1x 18 so A will be 2x 54 which is 1x 27 7 hours. Ninth question. So A can do 40%age of the work in 12 days whereas B can do 60%age of the work in 15 days. So both work together for 10 days. C completes the remaining work in 4 days. ABC together completes 28%age of the work in see again the question is based on our target is to find if all the three person are working 28%age of the work how many days it takes to complete it and what are all the values they have initially given us they didn't give you the values directly A can do a work 40%age of the work in 12 days how will you find 100%age of the work if he is doing 40%age of the work in 12 days either you can find what is 1 percentage of the work and you can say 100%age of the work you'll be completing in 30 days I think a will be completing a piece of work in 30 days if you are faster in calculation like if you find what is 1 percentage then finding 100%age is easy or else if you are struggling to find a values in calculating mind then no problem 40%age is equal to 12 then you can write like this 100% is equal to x cross multiply we can cancel 0 0 1 4's are 4 3 4's are 12 x is equals to 30. That means if the person A is completing 40%age of the work in 12 day, then A alone can complete the total work in 30 days. That is one easy way to solve the question. Practice it now and in exams try to do it in a mind calculation. Right? So similarly B can do a piece of work 60%age of the work in 15 days. How will you calculate? 60%age equal to 15. 100% is equal to X. So 60%age is equals to 15 four times 25 days. If you want you can do this. See 60%age of the work he will be completing in how many days? 15 days. So 100%age how many days he will takes X. So now cross it 1 5 are five. This will be four times 1 four are four this will be 25. So X is equals to 25. That means the person B alone B right yes B alone can complete a piece of work in 25 days. A alone will be completing the piece of work in 30 days. So now what is the target here? Both work together for 10 days. Initially find what is the work done both the people by 10 days. So 1 by 30 plus 1 by 25 both the person if they are working together into 10 because they are working for 10 days. So 30 25 I think again we can go with 150 150 can be the LCM year. So 150 this will be five times this will be four six times so into 10 we can cancel 0 0 here resultant will be 11 by 15 so 11 by 15 is what the total work done by both the person A and B in how many days 10 days then what is the remaining work 1 minus 11 by 15 again 4 by 15 so 4 by 15 is what the remaining work yes this is the work what they have done for 10 day and the remaining work which is remaining is 4 by 15. And now according to the question what they are saying is C completes the remaining work in 4 days. That means this work was completed by C in 4 days. So 4 by 15th of the work some work right out of that work the person C will be completing 4 by 15th of the work in how many days? 4 days that was mentioned in the question. So we can cancel it. So C alone can complete a piece of work in 15 days. Now we got all the three person. Yes. A alone will be completing in 30 days. B alone completing in 25 days. C alone 15 days. So now finding the answer is easy. If all the three person are working, we need to find what is 28%age. Do not find 28. First find what is 100. Right? So A B C. So A will be 30, B will be 25 and C is how much? 15. So take LCM. Again the easy way to take an LCM. Take the bigger number. Check whether this number is a multiple of the remaining number. It's not multiple. 2 * 60 is not multiple. 5 * 150 is the multiple of all the numbers. So this will be five and this will be six right and this will be 10. So this will be 11. 11 + 10 will be 21. 21 divided by 150. So when you reciprocal it finally if all the three person are working they will be completing a task in 150 by 21 days. But our target this is 100%age of the work right? So we didn't find 28 percentage anywhere else but at last in the question they have mentioned it if they have to do only 28%age of the work. So from this value find what is 28 28 by 100. So now it is easy right? Cancel it on seven table 7 3's are 21 7 4 are 28 cancel 0 here. So 1 3's are 3 5 3's are 15 1 5's are 5 2 5's are 10 cancel two. How easy it is 2 days. So finally if all the three person are working 100%age of the work they will be completing in 155 150 by 20 21 days but our target to find out of that 100%age only 28. So 28%age that will be completed in 2 days. So answer for this question is 2 days right easy understand the question clearly how what are all the values they have given in the question be slow solve very slowly while learning I'm saying right while learning solve very slowly and if you keep on solving a question automatically you will get an idea right so answer for this question is 2 days 10th question so A B C together build a wall in 12 days so C is four times productive as B and A alone can build a wall in 48 days. In how many days A and B together can build a wall. So interesting question totally there are three person year that is A B C together. So all the three person can complete a work in 12 days. So what they have value they have given us a plus b + c is equals to 1 by 12. And listen carefully what is called as productive. Productive is something like like efficiency. We can consider it as an efficiency. He is working faster. I'm more productive than you. That means uh if you are doing a work completing a work in one day then I will be completing a work in half a day itself. More productive that means working faster or more efficient. Right? So here what they saying is C is four times as productive as B. So that means C is to B. While comparing C is to B what they are saying is C is four times productive. So when you write it in a efficiency way if B is one person then C will be four times efficient. If B is alone only one efficient then C will be four times efficient than B. When you same consider it in a time ratio then it will be 1 is to4. The same thing what we learned initially. I think first of second question itself I have told this how to convert the ratio efficiency ratio into time ratio that is most important. So 4 is to 1 that should be written as 1 is to 4 in terms of time ratio. If B is taking 4 days to complete a work A will be C will be taking only 1 day to complete a work because C is more productive four times productive than B. E is working faster when compared to B. So if B is taking 4 days, C will be taking only one day. So now what are all the values they have given us? A alone build a wall in 48 days. That value has been directly given. So a value will be 1x 48 and we already know that in the terms of time ratio if c is x b will be 4x. So b will be 1x 4x c will be 1x is equals to 1x2. Now let us find what is the value of x here. So the easy way to take an LCM is first bring this 48 towards right hand side and then solve both the parts separately so that we won't make any mistake. Right? So 1x 4x so this part separately I'm taking 4x as LCM. So this will be 1 and this will be 4 is equals to 1x 12 minus 1x 48. So friends understood or not? So what I did is x part I have taken LCM separately and only the fraction part I'm taking LCM separately because when you take LCM directly if you are brilliant you can right no doubt about it. But if you are like beginners or intermediate student, you will make mistakes here and there on max. Don't do it. Take an x part separately fraction part separately and then find the LCM here. So bigger number multiple of this number. So this will be the LCM. So 12 4 are 48 minus of 1. So this will be 5 by 4x. So we can this will be three right? 4 - 1 will be 3. 1 4 are 4. So this will be 12 times. So this will be 4 times. So x is equals to 20. So finally we got x is equals to 20. That means where c alone can complete a piece of work in 20 days. Then what about b? So 4 into 2 which is 80. 80 days b alone takes to complete a work. C will be taking 20 days to complete a work equals to 20. So if both the person A and C working. So A will be completing a task in 48 days. Then what about B? B will be completing a task in 80 days. So 1x 48 plus 1x 80. So if you wish you can find directly your LCM or else the better and easy way always I would suggest is take some numbers outside. I think we can take 1x4 outside. If I take 1x4 outside this will be 12 and this will be 20. Yes or no? Right? So if I take four outside so 1 4 are 4 2 4 are right 12 outside. Then if you take four from four common here remainder will be 20. Now taking an LCM is easy. So now taking an LCM 1x4 into so this will be 20 + 12. So 20 + 12 will be 32. So divided by 20 into 12 will be 240. So now we can cancel it. I think 1 * this will be 8 * 8 4 are 32. So 13. So answer will be 30 days. So 30 days if a and b is working 30 days they will be completing the work. Right? Easy or not? Right? Easy question. So always remember that how to convert the efficiency into a time ratio and how to substitute in an equation. Taking an LCM is the main part in time and work. For taking an LCM always keep X terms or Y terms separately, remaining fraction term separately. Take separately the LCM for two different expression and then you will get the answer correctly. Right? So here is the 11th question. So A can do 50%age of the job in 16 days. B can do 1/4th of the job in 24 days. So working together in how many days? They do 7/4 of the job. Okay. So interesting question. So here there are some values are in a fraction here. So first A can do 50%age of the job in 16 days. I've told you how to convert this 50%age into 100%. Do it in a mind calculation. If 50%age A can do it in 16 days then 100%age will be double the time which is 32 days. So A will be completing the piece of work in 32 days. Similarly B can do 1/4 of the same job in 24 days. Just listen here. B can do 1/4th of the same job. That means some work what the person A is doing out of that work not a some work out of that 1x4th of the work 1/4 of the same job is completed in 24 days. That means B alone can complete a total work will be 96 days. So A will be completing a piece of work in 32 days. B will be completing the piece of work in 96 days. So now what is the value? working together in how many days they can do 7/4 of the job. So first always find either 50%age of the job like previous question 28%age of the job. First find if both the person alone how many days they can complete a work. Let's find a and b. So a will be 1x 32 b will be 1x 96. So now 96 is a bigger number which is the multiple of 32. 32 3 times will be 96. So we can take 96 as LCM. So this will be three times this will be 1 * 4 by 96. So finally A and B can complete a piece of work in 96 by 4 days. Yes. So now we can cancel it also. I think 1 2 4 are 8 remaining will be 1 4 4 are 16. So A and B can complete a piece of work in 24 days. But now our final target is to find how much time they take to find 7/4 of the job. So now just 7 by4 multiplied that's it 1 6 4 are 24 42. So now in order to complete 7/4 of the job it takes 42 days to complete it. So friends understood or not? So this is the way you have to solve the question always whether we need to find the final answer in terms of fraction of the work or percentage of the work try to find 100%age total work all the people how much days they are taking after that convert it into a fraction value whatever they are asking that will be always the best way to solve the question. 12th question x days x takes 10 days less than y to complete a task. Both X and Y together can complete a work in 12 days. In how many days Y alone take to complete a work? Just see I think we have solved one question that is based on a similar concept in terms of efficiency. I think so one person is taking 10 hours or 10 times more than B. So what we did we consider A as X days B will be X + 10. Similar concept here X takes 10 days less than Y. That means if y is equals to some days, let's assume 10 days. Y can complete a piece of work in x days. Then what about x? x takes 10 days less than y. So x will be 10 - x or x - 10. We don't know whether the value of x will be 10 less or something. So let's consider x - 10. E is taking 10 days less than y. So we can say less than y 10 x - 10. If you are getting confusion then take y as a days then this will be a minus 10 because x and x so many students will get a confusion here. So better we can consider it as y can complete a piece of work in a days some days. Now x will be a minus 10 because he is taking 10 days less. So a minus 10 will be x. So now what the question says is if both the person complete a piece of work in 12 days in how many days y alone take to complete a work. So that means if both the person so y will be 1x a x will be 1x a minus 10 if both the person are working they can complete a piece of work in 12 days 1x 12 so cross multiply it a - 10 + a divided by a² - 10 a is equals to 1x 12 I think we will get a quadratic equation here similar to the question like what we solved so this will be 2 a - 10 right into 2 because into 12 we We will be multiplying 12 here. So a² - 10 a. So now this will be 24 a minus of 120 equal to a² - 10 a. So finally we will get a quadratic equation. So a² minus of 34 a + 120 =0. So now we need to get uh 34 we'll get 46. No we are not getting 34 34 yes sorry it's a quadratic equation we can go with the 30 and four so minus 30 minus 4 when you multiply both the number 120 when you add both the number resultant will be minus 34 so finally we can say a= 30 and bal 4 so that means two factors so one value a= 30 and the second value a= 4 so now getting into the point our target is to find in how many days y takes to complete a work. We know that y we have assumed as a days. So now we got two value based upon the option right based upon either he can take 30 days to complete a work or 4 days to complete a work based upon the options they have given we can mark the answer. Question number 13. So A and B can complete a work in 15 days and 10 days respectively. So they started doing the work together but after 4 days B had to leave. Then A working with the new worker C completed the remaining work in 3 days. If C works alone in how many days he can do 40%age of the work? Again the question is based on some percentage value. Interesting question because A and B were working and then after 4 days B is leaving again. A is working with C for some days and then the total work has been completed. Our target is to find if C alone was working how many days they take to complete a work. B slow we have understood the concept of the question. So now step by step we can solve it. First A and B they are working for how many days? Four days. First let's find what is the 4 day work that was done by A and B. So A and B four day work. So four into A alone can complete a piece of work in 15. B alone will be 10. So now we can take this will be 25 divided by 150. So now 25 1 * this will be 6 * 2x3. So 2x3 is what? 2x3 is the work that was completed in 4 days by A and B. Then what is the remaining work they have will be 1x3. So 1 by3 is the remaining work. So now according to the question after working for 4 days the person B left. So now what the person A is doing is he is working with the C to do the remaining work in how many days? 3 days. That means this is the remaining work right. So the remaining work from the total work the remaining work 1 by 3 that was completed by A and C in 3 days. That means a and c alone they can complete a total work in 9 days. Yes or no? Because 1 by 3 when you bring this three towards right hand side it becomes 3 into 3 9 days. So A and C alone they can complete a piece of work in 9 days. So now according to the question our target to find C alone how many days they take to complete 40%age of the work. We know A and C equal to 9 days. And we know A alone will be completing the piece of work in 15 days. Finding the answer is easy. So a alone will be 15 days. So 1x c is equals to 1 by 9 because both the person can complete a piece of work in 9 days. So 1x c is equals to 1x 9 - 1 by 15. So 45 can be the LCM which will be the multiples of the remaining number. So this will be 5 * this will be 3 * 2x 45 that means c alone can complete a piece of work in 45 by2 days. This is not the answer because we always usually find 100%age of the work that the person C can complete it in 45 by2 days. 100%age of the work C will be complete in 45 by2 days. But what is the target? Our target is to find E has to complete 40%age of the work. That means into 40 by 100, right? So 40%age from the total work he has to take do only 40%age. 40 by 100 cancel it 1 * 2 * 5 * 9 times so finally C will be taking 9 days to complete a work very interesting and easily we have solved the question so finally answer for this question is 9 days he is taking 9 days to do 40%age of the same work understood so friends step by step right so everything what I did it's a traditional method no shortcut no formulas nothing just a normal traditional method we did We have to do it in a faster way. That's it. So, A B working for 4 days. 4 day work remaining work. This remaining work was done by the two person in 3 days. So, two person alone can complete a piece of work in 9 days. A and B A and C completing in 9 days. We know A alone is 1x 15. By using this we found what is the C. So C alone can complete a piece of work in 45 by 2 days. But our target is to find from the total work he has to do only 40%. So into 40 by 100 once you cancel it we found the answer as 9 days. 14th question A B C together can complete a work in X 30 and 45 days respectively. B and C together worked for 6 days. The remaining work that was completed by A alone in 12 days. The value of X's. So see friends what they have given is A B C together can complete a piece of respectively. That means A will be completing a work in X days. B will be 30 days. C will be 45 days. But now according to the question B and C initially they have worked for 6 days. We know that separately B alone can complete a piece of work in 30 days. C alone can complete a piece of work in 45 days. This will be the value for B and C. So now what they are saying is both the person are working initially for 6 days into six. So now what we can do here is I think we can take LCM 90 here because 45 is the bigger number but 45 is not a multiple of 30. 45 twice will be 90. So 90 90 is the multiple of 30. So 90 will be the LCM. So I think 3 3's are 9. So 452. So 5 by 90 into 6. So we can cancel it. This will be 18 * 3 times. So 1x 3. So 1x 3 is what? 1x3 is the total work that was completed by B and C in 6 days. Then what is the remaining work? 2x3. So 2x3 of the work is remaining work is there. So now this remaining work that was completed by A in 12 days. So from the total work, right? So A completed 2x3 of the work in how many days? 12 days. Because E completed the remaining work in 12 days. We got the remaining value as 2x3. So 2x3 of the work in 12 day. So a alone can complete a piece of work. This will be six times as 18 days. So a alone can complete a piece of work in 18 days. That that is the value they're asking what is the value of x. So x is nothing but the initial value. Initially we kept in the question itself they have given a as x days. Easy question. So answer for this question is a alone can complete a piece of work in 18 days. Question number 15. P can complete 5 by8 of the work in 15 days. Q can complete 3x4 of the work in 30 days. They work together for 8 days and the person P left. So the remaining work was completed by Q in how many days? Right? So our target is to find the remaining work. How much time will Q alone working alone takes to complete the remaining work? So remaining work was completed by Q in how many days? The concept everything is easy but look at the options here. So options are not not directly in terms of days. The values are in terms of days as well as in terms of hours. So after finding the final answer I have seen many students usually struggle to find the convert the days into hours. Right? So let let me solve this simple question. At last I will tell you what you what is the easy technique that you can easily convert the days in terms of fraction into one hours. So P can complete five five by 8 of the work in 15 days. So P work that is 5 by8 of the work in 15 days. We have learned all these concept many times. So three so P will be 24. So P alone will be completing a piece of work in 24 days. What about Q? So Q will be 3/4 of the work right? 3/4 of the work in 30 days. So we can cancel this 10 times. So Q alone will be completing the piece of work in 40 days. And according to the second point of the question what they have mentioned is they worked together for 8 days and then after 8 days P left. So that means our target is initially to find out 8 days what is the total work done by both the person P and Q. So P and Q. So P + Q is equals to 1x4 + 1x 40. So now taking an LCM if if you can you can take the LCM faster like keeping 120 as LCM here. So this will be five times and this will be three times. So 8 divided by 120. So 8 divided by 120 is what the total work that was completed by P and Q in 1 day. Now they are working for 8 days. So into 8 when you multiply this by 8 four table this will be 30. So four table two times. So again I think we can cancel it on two table one times. This will be 15. So 8 divided by 15. So 8 by 15 is the total work that was completed by P and Q in 8 days. So we have to find the remaining work. So 1 - 8 by 15 will be 7 by 15. So 7 by 15 is the remaining work. Now right this remaining work has to be completed by the second person Q because the P left after working for 8 days. So Q has to complete the remaining work. Just listen carefully. We already know that Q alone can complete the piece of work in 40 days. So now Q has to do only 7 by 15th of the work. Right? So out of this 40 days E he should not do 100%age of the work. E has to do out of the total work only 7 by 15th. So directly you can multiply by 7 by 15. So now because total work he can complete in 40 days but our target is to find only to complete 7 by 15th of the work. So out of total work 7 by 15 has to be completed e alone will be completing in 40 days. So now I think we can cancel it on five table 5 3's are 15 cancel it on five table 8 five are 40. So this will be 56 by3. Yes. So finally we got the answer as 56x3. So the person Q alone completing the piece of work in 56x3 days. But look at the options. So the options are like 18 hours, 17 hours, 15 hours, 15 days, 24 hours, 16 days, 18 hours. So the value what they have given is in terms of days as well as in terms of hours. But here we got the value final answer in terms of fraction. So first we can convert it into mixed fraction. If you divide 56 by 3 it will be like how many times? 18 * right 18 * remaining will be 2. So 18 into 3 will be 54 remaining will be 2. So this when you convert it into a mixed fraction the answer will be 18 2x3. So this can be written as just listen carefully 18 as 18 days 2x3 we have to convert this 2x3 into hours we know that for a day totally we have 24 hours but e completed the work in 18 days 2x3 hours right so now 2x3 of the day 1 day equal to 24 hours just multiply this fraction part alone into 24 hours so once you cancel it 1 3's are 8 3's are 24 8 into 2 will be 16. So 16 hours. So the final answer for this question is 18 days 16 hours. So friends understood or not? Right. So easy question at last I have seen students struggling to find this part alone. How to convert this value this value into days as well as hours. So first we have to convert this value in terms of a mixed fraction. And after converting into a mixed fraction the first number act as the total days. So total days 18 days and the balance is 2x3 of the day. For a day we have 24 hours. But e complete the work in 2x3 of the 1 day work 2x3. So 1 day totally we have 24 hours. Out of 24 hours he completed within 2x3 of the day. So 24 hours into 2x3 resultant will be 16 hours. So 18 days and 16 hours he will be completing the remaining work. So this is the way we have to convert the total either it can be a fraction value or a decimal value. So this is the easy way to convert the value into days and hours. So X can complete half of the work in 20 days. Y can do 1/5ifth of the same work in 10 days. So X started the work and left after 8 days. So y took to complete the remaining work. So the total work that was taken by them to complete the work. Right? So here the concept is based on leaving concept because some at some point the person left you can see after working for a days. So the person has left the job the person X has left the job and the remaining job that was completed by B. So our target is to find the total work done in how many days. So I have solved most of the question here by a traditional method. But while I am teaching in my YouTube channel while I am teaching the question that is based on leaving and joining I've told you one shortcut equate to one that will be the easy way to solve the question. Even the previous question also you can solve like that. So I can solve one question what the the easy way and the shortcut method what I thought on my YouTube channel. Right? So there are two person one is the person X and the second person is the Y and the first person X can complete half of the work in 20 days then the total work will be completed by X in 40 days. So similarly Y so the second person Y will be 1/5 of the work in 10 days then the total work will be completed by Y in 50 days. So we have learned already all these steps already in the previous question. So now according to the question X started the work and left after 8 days. So that means the person X has started the work. So out of 40 days of X, E had been working only for 8 days. Yes or no? Because the total work X will be completing in 40 days but E worked only for 8 days and the second person now Y. So why what E is doing is E completes the remaining work but that days was not mentioned here. So equal to one that's it understood or not? So this is the shortcut what I taught you on my YouTube channel while teaching leaving and joining concept. So the denominator value will be the person capacity right. So he can complete the piece of work in 40 days he can complete the piece of work in 50 days. X and Y out of 40 days the person first person worked only for 8 days and he left. The remaining job that was was completed by the second person Y but we don't know how many days he takes to complete the work. So we assumed it as X. So our target is to find the total work done was completed in how many days. So once you find the value of x adding with 8 resultant will be the total number of days taken to complete the work. I think we can cancel it 1 5. So this will be 1x 5. So x by 50 is equals to 1 - 1x 5. So x by 50 is equals to 5 - 1 will be 4x 5. So we can cancel it 10 times. So x is equals to 40. That means we got the value of x is equals to 40. The resultant answer is not 40. We just got the value of x is equals to 40. Where the 40 represents the remaining work that was completed by the second person in 40 days. But our answer what we need to find is the total work how many days it takes to complete a work. Initially the person X worked for 8 days and the remaining work was completed by the Y in 40 days. So 40 days remaining work initially 8 days. So totally 48 days. So the total work was completed in 48 days. So which will be the answer for this question. So friends understood or not? If you want you can solve the same question like a traditional method. What I did on previous two three question we have solved question like this. two person were working and then one person left the job after 8 days 12 days etc. So what I usually do is I will find two person working and then into eight how many days they are working what is the remaining work and that remaining work has to be completed by the second person in how many days that is the traditional method and this is the shortcut method what I thought on my channel it's you have wish whatever method you choose you can solve the question but remember one thing always finding the final answer and the conversion value taking LCM part is the most important thing in the topic time work. So next question, A can do 2x5 of the work in 12 days while B can do 66 2x3 percentage of the work in 16 days. So they worked together for 10 days. B alone will complete the remaining work in so again similarly like like previous concept right so previous concept is where the first person is working and then he left after some days the B will be taking the remaining part of the work. So here what they are saying is they worked together for 10 days. So both the person initially working for 10 days. Then after 10 days the person left one person left and the remaining work was been completed by the second person. So our target is to find B alone how many days it takes to complete the remaining work. Interesting question but listen carefully. One value is alone in terms of fraction mixed fraction and in terms of percentage. Easy. Just see a can do 2x five of the work in 12 days. So 2x five of the work in 12 days that means in order to complete the total work by A will be 1 2's are 2 4 3's are 12 sorry 6 2's are 12 which will be 30. So A alone can complete a piece of work in 30 days. So the second value is important 66 2x3 percentage. So 66 2x3 percentage of the work in 16 days. So we have solved two to three question I think. So in this video itself based on percentages. So 40%age of the work the person will be completing in 12 days. So I have told you what is the shortcut to find 100%age. It is easy right? So 100%age is equal to you don't want to buy out any values here. If 66 2x3 percentage is equals to 16 days then what about 100%? 100 percentage is equal to x. Just cross multiply it 63 18 198 to 200. So when you convert the mixed fraction into a fraction so 200 divided by 3 percentage will be 16 days. So 100% is equals to x. So now cancel it 100 this will be 2 * 1 2's are 2 a 2's are 16. So x is equals to 24. That means the second person b alone take 24 days to complete a work. So a will be taking 30 days to complete a work. So now according to the question both the person were working for 10 days after 10 days the person A left either you can go with the traditional method or you can go with the shortcut method whatever you wish right. So A 30 days and B capacity will be 24 days and the both the person are doing one work. So now A and B both the person are working initially for 10 days. So 10 year and 10 year because both the person are working for 10 days. After 10 days the person A left. So the person second person B is doing the remaining job in some some amount of days right we don't know how many days he takes but after 10 days the person B is working for another some days so 10 + x is equals to 1 now just cross multiply it or else we can take an LCM as 120 here so this will be 4 * 40 and this will be 5 * this will be 50 + 5x is equ= to 1 so this will be 90 + 5x is equ= to 1 20 so 5x is equ= to 30 year so x is equ= to 6 so that means the remaining work our target is to find b alone will complete the remaining work in how many days so we kept x as the remaining time that the person B is taking to complete the work and finally we got the answer x is equals to six that means the remaining work that was completed by the second person B in 6 days so which will be the answer for this question. So the important part of the question is this part alone. So we have solved many question like this but this question is alone little bit different. Why? Because the value is in terms of mixed fraction as well as in terms of percentage. See mixed fraction and then percentage. So I have seen many students buy out the value 62 2x3 they buy like 2x3 fraction number it's you have wish but according to me uh instead of batting understand the simple concept how to convert 66 2x3 as 100%. So 100% is equal to x. This when you convert it into a fraction 200 by 3 and we have to cross multiply it better you can cancel here itself where you can save your time 100 2 * 1 2's are 2 a 2's are 16. So denominator 3 here a 3's are 24. So finally the value of x is equals to 24 days. So a can finish 1x3 of the work in 5 days. So b can finish 2x five of the same work in 10 days. So C can finish 75%age of the same work in 15 days. So they work together for 6 days. The remaining work will be finished by B alone. So our target is to find where initially all the three person are working for 6 days and then the remaining work was completed by B alone. How many days? Our target is to find B alone. How many days E takes to complete the remaining work. So either you can solve this question by a traditional method or else by a single equation method. Right? So first according to the question the values are not directly given. So A will be finishing one/ird of the work in 5 days. So A will be finishing one/ird of the work in 5 days. That means A alone will be completing the piece of work in 15 days. Similarly B. So B can take 2x5 of the work in 10 days. So B will be completing 2x5 of the work in 10 days. So this can be written as B will be completing the piece of work in 25 days. So now what about C? So C will be completing 75%age of the same work in 50 days. So if 75%age in 15 days and we have to find what is 100%. So 75%age is equals to 15 then So 100% is equal to x. So now cross multiply we can cancel it on 25 table. So this will be three times this will be four times 1 3's are 3 5 3's are 15. So x is equals to 20 days where c alone can complete a piece of work in 20 days or for practicing write like this in your exams go with the mind calculation that will be the timesaving method right. So finally we found a will be 15 days b will be 25 days and c will be 20 days. So now according to the question all the three person were working initially for 6 days. So the first person A out of 15 days he is working for six day and the second person B he is working for six day as well as after 6 day is the person who is completing the remaining work. So six plus some days he is working that is the remaining day he will be completing the task and the third person C out of 20 days E is also working for 6 days. So all the three person were working for 6 days and then after 6 days the B alone completing the remaining work. So that's the reason for B alone the second person I have 6 + X. So now I think we can cancel it on three table right once you cancel it on three table. So this will be two times this will be five times cancel it on two table three times and this will be 10. So keep this number as it is is equals to 1 minus of 2x 5 minus of 3x 10. So now take LCM. So 6 + x is equals to 25. So I think we can take LCM as 10 here. If I take LCM as 10. So this will be 10 and this will be 2, right? So 2 will be 6. So now 10 as it is. So keep four as it is. So four 3 7. So 10 - 7 will be 3. So this can be written as 6 + x / 25 is equ= to 3x 10. So cancel it on five table. So 5 * 2 * cross multiply it. So 12 + 2x is equ= to 15. So 2x is equ= to 3 x is equ= to 3x2 days. So finally we can say that the total the remaining work that was completed by the second person B in 3x2 days which will be 1.5 day. So 1.5 day we can convert into uh days and hours right. So 1.5 that is 1 day 0.5 is 12 hours half of the day 24 hours half will be 12 hours. So 1 day 12 hours. So I've told you how to convert it right. So this is the way we have to find the answer either this method. This is the method what I thought on my channel right. So for leaving as well as for the joining concept both the concept you can use this method. So this is one of the easy way to solve the question and important part of this question is this part how to convert the percentage value into an 100% and then writing that part. So two major part in this question and other than that everything is simple and I've told you don't take directly LCM here because if you take directly LCM here that will be the tricky way and it takes more time. So better keep the X term as it is and bring all the remaining fraction towards right hand side and then try to solve the question that will be the easy way and easily you can take the LCM. Right? If you keep the number as it is then the LCM part will make you more time to solve it. So answer for this question is 3x2 days. Next question. So A can finish a piece of work in certain number of days. So B takes 145%age more number of days to finish the same work independently. So they work together for 58 days and then the remaining work was done by B alone in 29 days. In how many days A have completed the work that E worked alone. So our target is to find if A alone is working then how many days E takes to complete the work and this concept is also similarly like they work together for 50 A days and then the remaining work was completed by B that means after working for some days where the person A left so the remaining work was completed by B alone in 29 days it's leaving joining concept where you can able to solve this question by uh equ that that single equation method. So first they have given A can finish the piece of work in certain number of days. So the days was not mentioned here. So what we can do here is A let's take it as X. So B will be 45%age more that means 145%age of X. Yes or no? Right? So friends understood or not because what they are saying is A can finish a piece of work in certain days. So that certain days we assumed it as X. So the person B is working 45%age more when compared to A. So B will be 145 percentage of A. So 145 percentage of X. So this can be written as 145X divided by 100. If we convert the percentage into a normal number. So divided by 100 into X. So this will be the value of B and this will be the value of A. So now according to the question where the both the person are working for 58 days. A is also working for 58 days. B is also working for 58 days. So now A capacity will be X days. And what about the B's capacity? So 100 goes to the numerator. So denominator will be 125 X is equals to because 145X by 100. So 100 goes to the numerator. So 100 divided by 145X. So now according to the question both the person are working for 58 days. So 58 divided by x again 100 both the person are working for 58 days. So 58 equal to 1. So now the next point is after working for 58 days B completes the remaining work and then the remaining work was completed by B alone in 28 days. Both the person initially working for 58 and then extra 29 days where the person B is working. So plus 29 58 days both the person are working and then 29 days extra where the person B is working to complete the remaining work. So plus 29. So this can be written as 58 by X. So plus into so this will be 917. So remaining will be 187. So divided by 145x = 1. So I think we can cancel it on three table. Yes, we can cancel it on No, we can't. Five table. When you cancel it on five table, 20. So cancel it on five table. So five 2's are 10. So remaining will be four. 45. 9 fs are 45. So this will be three times right. So 60. So 58 by X + 60 by X is equals to 1. So once you add the two value so x is equals to 118 days that means so finally we found the value of x. x is what we have substituted x as a equal to x. So the total work completed by a alone in 118 days. So this will be the answer for this question. So very interesting question right. So try to understand how I wrote this part alone because both the person days was not given they have compared in terms of percentages. So this is the way you have to write 30%age more 40%age more write it as 140 then figuring out the answer is very easy. Question number 20. A group of men decided to do a work in 6 days but every day 18 men left the job. If the work is completed in 8 days, how many men initially decided to do the work? So the concept is based on leaving concept because every day 18 men are leaving the work. So this concept it's not one time they are leaving every day they are leaving. Right? If the concept is like this similarly the concept can be the same question can also be like this every day 18 men joining the group that that can be also one way of question. But listen carefully these model questions you can easily solve by using a formula of arithmetic progression. I have taught the similar concept question on my YouTube channel last lesson of time and work which was asked in the CAT exam. I have told I've told you what is called as arithmetic progression. There is a formula called s of n equal to nx2 + 2 a + n minus 1 into d. So once you apply the formula because every day the same number of people are leaving 18 18 people are leaving if for example if one day 18 people leaving next day 16 people leaving third day 15 people leaving then you can't able to use AP formula if every day the same number of people are leaving then you can use arithmetic progression formula to solve the question but here according to the question many students were asking me how to solve these kind of question without AP formula without arithmetic formula yes you Initially a group of men decided to do a work in 6 days. So 6 days right? So group of people are working but we don't know what is the total number of people are working initially but these people were working for 6 days to complete the work. So first day x number of people will be working but from the next day that is on every day where 18 people left the job. So first day initially x number of people will be working every day. Next day 18 people are leaving x minus 18 because we don't know how many people were working initially to complete the job. Out of this first day, second day 18 people leaving the job. Next day another 18. So x minus of 188 18 will be 36. So this will be the third day. So total work will be completed in 8 days. So 8 day they are working like this. First day x number of people are working. Second day 18 people were left. Third day 36 people were left because every day 188 18. So fourth day will be x minus of again another 18 will be 54. So next again xus of 18 will be 72 and again x - of 90. X minus of 1 8 and X - of 1 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 and again 18 people are leaving. So 126. So totally the total work will be completed in 8 days. So this will be the 8 day work right because total work will be completed in 6 days and the total men were employed which is unknown. So 6 into x equal to total number of people working every day 18 number of people are leaving the job. So now 18 when you subtract 18 18 from all the values. So resultant will be 6x is equals to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8. So 8x minus of 18 90 180 180 90 90 here 126 54 so 54 so this will be 2x is equ= to 54 so x is equals to 252 so that means the final answer will be 252 so initially 252 man will be appointed Right. But after appointing 252 people every day when 18 people leaving the job the total work will be completed in 8 days because the work will be completed not completed on 6 days because some people are leaving the work. So some days will be extended. So two days are extended right. So from the total thing where the two days will be extended because of 18 people leaving the job daily. So 18 again another 18 from the total the remaining work remaining number of people will be working on the third day and on the fourth day out of the total people 54 people are left the work on the fifth day from the total 72 people will not be there on the sixth day out of total 90 people will not be there on the seventh day out of total one not people will not be there and on the last 8th day from the total 126 people will not be there but not on 9th because 8 days they completed the job on the eighth day. So this we have written for total 8 days work is equals to the total work. But our target in the question how many men initially decided to work initially we have assumed it as x which will be 252 answer for this question. Right. So friends finally uh in this video we have solved more number of important question that is on the topic time and work. So try to solve many question if you are preparing for the upcoming exam like IBBS clerk or RRBP1 and RRB clerk. So nowadays uh the data interpretation in the prelims exam itself it's little bit difficult. So students are struggling to solve all the five question in the exam. So now our target must be on some of the miscellaneous topic. So even though if the DA was difficult in the exam we have to target some miscellaneous topics also. So time and work seems to be little bit easy because we don't have any formulas like that. If you know the concepts clearly solving it will be very easy. So friends, thank you so much for watching this video and if you really like it, share the video to your friends those are preparing for the competitive exams. So thank you so much. Bye.",unknown
ylCxzo_eth0,"First of all, thanks for being here in my YouTube channel. So friends, if you are a regular follower of my channel. So do not forget to purchase my book quantitative aptitude book and start solving all the question what I have given in this book. Right? Because each and every question it's an art level question. Nowadays our competitive exam level or keep on increasing. So practice all the questions what I have given inside this book. If you have any doubt on purchasing it, do not forget to watch this video. In the unboxing video, I have told you what all the topics are there and where to buy this book everything. So, if you are a regular follower of feel free to learn, do not forget to purchase this book on our platform. So, now let me move on to the video. So friends, now let me move on to the third video on the seating arrangement that is based on the concept called triangle. So triangle the person six person will be sitting in the triangle or nine person will be sitting on the triangular based seating arrangement person. So very interesting and uh this is very rare case uh in the past five years of bank prelims exam as well as when we when we look into the SSC question papers. So one or two question that was asked from the concept of triangle based seating arrangement better we can learn this also in any case it can be important. So if you are preparing for SSC or if you are preparing for the bank prelims so learn this topic that is triangular seating arrangement. So there are two cases of diagram like for example when we take a circle some person will be facing inside and some person will be facing outside that are the two categories of circular arrangement. But when you take a triangle-based seating arrangement uh in a triangle based seating arrangement there are two category one is six person sitting in a triangle or else nine person sitting in a triangle. So these are the two concept if it is a six person sitting in a triangular based arrangement. So three person will be at the corners and this is called as a side of a triangle. So three person will be at this side. So all of them are facing center or all of them are facing away from the center that is different case. But we have to understand if there are six person sitting in a triangular arrangement our diagram should be like this. And if there are nine person sitting in a c in the triangular arrangement then so most probably three people will be sitting at each of the corners and side two person two person two person. So this is called as nine person sitting in a triangular arrangement and this will be six person sitting in a triangular arrangement. So these are the two cases that was repeatedly asked in our competitive exams. So but anyway these are two categories but in case in an exam they can ask in any different way but make sure to read the first passage of the seating arrangement always and then you have to solve the question but these are the two major categories of a triangular based seating arrangement puzzle. So now let me move on to some of the questions here that is based on a triangle seating arrangement. So here is the first seating arrangement puzzle. So there are nine person A to I are sitting around a triangular table facing the center and all of them are sitting in an alphabetical order in a clockwise direction. One person is sitting at the corner and each side two person is sitting in the middle of the each side. So each person likes a different colors but not necessarily in the same order. So totally there are nine person on every corners there are one person sitting right and all the remaining sides there are two person and all of them were facing the center. So this is the point they have given in the first passage of the arrangement and they have mentioned one important point the person who are all sitting here they are sitting in an alphabetical order in a clockwise direction. For example, if it is A, then the clockwise direction will be B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, etc. Right? So they are sitting in an alphabetical order in a clockwise direction. Right? So first point and also we need to find which person likes which color and where he is sitting. So first point in case if required we can go with the two diagrams if we if we got any possibilities but remember that you can draw two or three possible minimum two or three is okay. But if it is if we are getting four possible diagram kindly don't waste your time on the exam make sure to fix the clues within one or two arrangements right one or two diagram itself so that we can solve the question easily within two or 3 minutes. So now the first point is the one who likes red sits third to right of C. So one who likes red sits third to right of C. So C right hand side at the third place the person who likes red is sitting but we don't know whether the person C is sitting at the corners or the person C is sitting at the middle. So better we can write it as a clue here. So C right hand side at a third place the person who likes red color is sitting. Next point the one who likes violet sits second to right of C who likes blue. So the person C likes blue and the person who likes violet color is violet right is sitting second to right of C already in the third place red is sitting. So now see right hand side at a second place we got we got to know that the person who likes violet color is sitting. Okay. So next point is C sits at one of the corners. So you can fix any of the corner because we have three corners in a triangle. So it is your wish either you can fix here, fix here or fix here. So I usually go here at from this point we can fix the person C here and we know that the person C likes blue color and C right hand side at the second place the person who likes violet is here and C right hand side at the third place the person who likes red. So finally we have fixed all the three person see blue violet and red just listen we have already read the first passage of the arrangement and there they have mentioned it the person who are all sitting here are in an alphabetical order we fixed C and alphabetical order in a clockwise direction. So if it is C then this will be D right. So this will be B and this will be A. So A B C D E F G H I that's it. So finally we have fixed all the members here because we fixed C one person if you fix C again you can write it in an clockwise direction whatever B you will get the correct answer right. So here after fixing C we already know that the first passage itself they have given a clue all the person sitting here nine person are sitting in an alphabetical order that two in a clockwise direction. So by using the letter C we have fixed the remaining letters right. So the next point is there are two persons sitting between green and red. So between green and red there is a gap of 2%. Already we have fixed red here. You can't able to fix green. So only chance that I should fix green here. So between green and red there is a gap of 2%. So next point the one who likes black sits immediate to the left. One who likes white. Neither of them likes E or D. So the person E or D both the person does not like black as well as white. But both the person how they are sitting is there are one person who likes black. It sits immediate to the left of the person who likes white. So white immediate left is black. Right? White immediate left is black. If I fix white here this must be black. Not possible. D and E is also not for white and black. The these two person does not like white and black. But white left hand side it should be black. I think these are the two places that are remaining here. So I should definitely fix white here because all the person are facing the center. So white left hand side this must be black. Yes. So finally still sorry some more points are remaining. There are two persons sitting between one who likes white and one who likes yellow. So white and yellow there is a gap of two person. So one and two we can't able to fix yellow here. Already we have fixed white. So one and two and this must be yellow. So between white and yellow there is a gap of two person. The one who likes pink is either B or I. So one who likes pink is either B or I. We already fixed I as red. Then definitely B will be pink. No other possible because B is the person who likes pink is either B or I. But we already fixed for I. So only one chance that B should be pink. I think everything is we are fixed. I sits at one of the corner. Yes, I is sitting at one of the corner and only one color which is remaining is purple right? Yes, purple is remaining. So, we can fix E as a purple. That's it. So, this will be the answer for the first arrangement question. Very interesting. Some of the clues are directly given. Most of the clues are directly given. But always remember that the first passage of the seating arrangement is always important because you have to read that carefully whether person are facing center or facing outside or uh whether some questions you can able to see the people who are sitting at the corner will be facing the center and the sides are away from the center and sometimes they will give you alphabetical order. So reading the first passage of the seating arrangement is always important. Right? So this will be the answer for the first arrangement. Second seating arrangement. So there are six people A to F are sitting around a circular table and such a way that three of them sits at the corner and other three sits at the middle of the side. So totally we have six person and if it is a six person anyway you have to read the question and then only you have to fix it. But if it is six person in a triangular arrangement most probably will be like this. So three person will be at the corners and other three person will be on the each side and all of them were facing the center right and it's so yes all of them were facing the center. So now let me move on to the first point they born in a different years. So we have to find which person born in which year and where he is sitting. So first point so f sits at one of the corner of the table. It's a direct statement where f is sitting at the corner of the table. You can fix f anywhere. So I can start from here. So I can fix at this corner where F is sitting at one of the corners. C sits it's one of the corner and either born in 1992 or 1996. So the person C is also sitting at the corner. But we have two possibilities. I think we don't want to another draw another diagram here. If I fix one person fixing C will be easy. So better we can write it as a clue. So the person C is sitting at the corner right and also we know one clue that the person C is born either in 92 or 96. Okay. So next point the one who sits immediate right of C is born in 1995. So the person who is to the immediate right of C if I fix C here this must be 95. If I fix C here see immediate right hand side this will be 95. We are getting two chances. So next point is and A sits opposite to one who born in 1995. So when just see here we already know that the person who is sitting immediate right of C is 1995. And what they are saying is the person A sits opposite to the person one who born in 1995. For example, if I fix C here, just listen carefully. So friends, if I fix C here, C right hand side will be 1995. This will be 1995 and the person who born in 1995 opposite to that person is A. But I have already fixed F year. So it is not possible. Only chance that I should fix C year and C immediate right and this is the person who born in 95 and this person 95 who who's born in 95 opposite to that person is A. So finally we have fixed three person and C is either born in 92 or 96. That's it. So, next point. A does not born in 1997. So, the person A does not born in 1997. E does not sit at any of the corners and does not born in 96 or 94. So, the person E is not sitting at the corners. Yes, we already know it because all the three person have occupied already. So, these are the two places, three places remaining. And they have mentioned one point that E does not sit at a corner and E is E does not born in the year 96 or 94. So these two years where E does not born. Okay. Okay. So next point E can be 95. No there are two chances. Let it be. Let me move to the next point. So D sits to the immediate left of A. So A left hand side immediately is D. So I can fix D here. and uh and born in 1993. So D will be 93 right? So it's a direct statement because D is sits immediate left of A and born in 93. It's a direct statement. The one who born in 1996 does not sit at any of the corner of the table. So 1996 is not sitting at any of the corners. So friends just listen here. We already know that this person is 92 or 96. So now what they said is if I fix 96 as C then they have mentioned the point the person who were all sitting at the corners is not born in the year 96. So definitely C must be 92 and 96 should be any of these three places already if it's 95 93 only one chance that this must be 96 and I think we already know that the person E is not sitting at the corners as well as the person E does not born in 96. So only chance that E must be on 95. No other way. Only one letter is remaining. A B is remaining. So B will be 96. I think we most probably fixed every option. And also we know that A does not born in 97. So only one chance that F must be 97. Right? And what all the remaining year that we have is 94. Yes, this must be 94. Still one more point is remaining. A does not born in 1997. They have already given that point. A does not born in 19. Okay. So if A does not born in 1997, then we have only one option which is 94. Yes. So this will be the answer for this question. Right? So C92, B 96. Let me check the answer please. 96 A D 93 97 95 92 Yes, it's correct. So, this will be the answer for this arrangement. So, very interesting arrangement and we have fixed the clue that we have written some of the clues here. If if required, we can go with two possible diagram. In case if it is not required, try to fix all the clue. Write down the clues separately in a proper way and then try to fix in the arrangement. we will definitely get the answer. If you practice like this solving the arrangement within 3 minutes or 2 minutes is definitely possible. Right? So this will be the answer for the second seating arrangement puzzle. So third arrangement. So six person A to F are sitting around a circular sorry triangular table and three of them are at the corners and other three of the middle. So all of them were facing the center they are and the different weight 56 not necessarily in the same order. So interesting person. So totally there are six person and if it is six person most probably three person will be sitting at the corners. So here we have three person sitting at the corner and other three person will be on the side and what they have mentioned here is and three of them middle of each of the side all are facing away from the center. That means every person is sitting away from the center. Okay. So first point E sits at the middle of one of the side of the table and this weight is either 60 or 70. So the person E is not sitting at the corner. He is sitting at any side and his weight is how much? Either 60 or 70 is you can start from here or here. It's wish I can write E here. any one of the side. So now what they said is the weight of the person E is either 60 or 70. Okay. So next point is F is at one of the corner but not immediate to E. So if F is at one of the corners then I can't able to fix F here as well as F here because F is not an immediate neighbor. So only one chance that I should fix F here. And another point what they have mentioned is and this weight is neither 55 nor 65. So the person F weight weight is neither 55 nor 65. So these two weight is not F. Okay. So next point is the weight of one of the person who is immediate left of F is 70. So immediate left of F is 70. See F left hand side will be this side. And the person who is sitting to the immediate left of F is 70. And this the person whose weight must be 70. And here we already know that the person E's weight is either 60 or 70. So now F left hand side person is exact weight is 70. So we can fix the person E weight is 60. One person is fixed. Okay. So still we have lot more points. A's weight is 80. It's a direct statement. And E is to the immediate right of B. So B right hand side is A and where the A's weight is 80. B right is A. uh if I fix B here this must be A 80. If I fix no possible I think these are the only two places. If I fix B here this must be A and this must be 80. Yes, because B immediate rate is A. So A's weight is 80 and immediate rate of B. Okay. So fixed D sits at one of the corner of the table and this weight is less than C's weight. So D is sitting at one of the corner. We have only one place remaining in the corner that must be D. And now what the point they have mentioned is the weight of D is less than C's weight. Where is C here? So only one place is remaining this must be C. So now what they mentioned is the person D's weight is less than C weight. So C is how much? 70. So below 70 what all the weights are there is 55 60 65. There are three weights already 60 is fixed. This person is not 65. 60 65. Okay. 65 and 55 is remaining. Okay. Let me uh read the remaining point. The weight of one who is immediate right of E is not 55. See the immediate rate of E is not 55. Immediate right of E means this person. So this person weight is not 55. So if the person weight is not 55 then only one weight it must be 65. Why? Because the person weight of D must be less than C. So less than C we have two option. Either it must be 55 or 65. But this person is not 55. So definitely it will be 65. And just listen carefully. We already know that F is not 55 or 65. Then B must be 55. Only one person weight is remaining. And what is the remaining weight that we have here is 80. 75. Yes 75 is remaining. And this must be 75. That's it. So I think we have fixed the weight for all the person as well as we have pointed out the persons. So easy arrangement again uh we can able to solve this arrangement fastly. Why? Because we have written the clues in a right way. Even it's a triangle or even it's a circle whatever the arrangement be even it can be an hexagonal no problem. But what is our target is if we can't able to fix it in arrangement write it in a separate clue in a proper way and then try to fix on the arrangement right. So let me check the answer whether we got correctly or not. So EC70 okay so a BF Afr. So next seating arrangement. So there are six person A to F or sitting in a triangular table such that three of them sits at the corner and the other three sits at the middle and the person who is sitting at the corners of the table or faces that center and the people who are sitting in the middle are facing away from the center. So again so totally there are six person right and the three person are sitting at the corners but the people who are sitting at the corners are facing the center and the people who is not sitting at the corners they are away from the center right. So these are the points they have mentioned here in the first passage of the arrangement as well as they like different colors. So here is the first point. So the person one who likes black sits at the corner of the table. So the person who likes black is sitting at the corner. So if he sitting at the corner, we have three corners. I can start from this point. So the person who likes black is sitting at the corner. So next point is E does not sit at a corner. So E is not sitting at the corner. So E should be at any one of the middle place. So let me write here. So the person E is not sitting at the corners. So this is the first clue what they have given in the question. So second point A likes neither pink nor blue. So again the person A does not like pink or else the person A does not like blue. So these are the two colors which was not liked by the person A. So the what there are one no one sits between black and F. So between black and F there is no one is sitting. So black we have already fixed either I should fix F here or F here. These are the two chances where we should fix F. Right? Okay. Still we have some more points remaining. A sits second to right of one who likes black. So black right hand side at the second place is A. So black right hand side at a second place we have A. And we already know that the person A does not like pink as well as blue. So already this point they have mentioned in the question. So C likes green color. Okay. So the person C likes green color but if we try to fix it we will get many possibilities. So next point is only one person sits between black and D. So between black and D we have a gap of one person. We already fixed A here. This is the only place for D. Between black and D there must be gap of one. Okay. So next two point is one who likes blue sits immediate right of one who likes pink. So pink immediate right it must be blue right. So pink immediate right must be blue. We already know that a is not pink as well as a is not blue. But now what they have mentioned is the one who likes blue sits immediate right of pink. So if I fix pink here this can't be blue. If I fix pink here already black is fixed. So I think only chance that this must be pink or blue and this must be pink or blue because if I fix pink here this will be blue. If I fix pink here this will be blue. Okay. So there are two chances pink and blue should be fixed here. But still we didn't fix f right because we know that f f should be an immediate neighbor of black. Okay. So next point is B does not sit at the adjacent side of A. So B is not sitting at the adjacent side of A. That means B is not an immediate neighbor of A. If B is not an immediate neighbor of A then these two places are not for B. So but we can fix B here or we can fix B here. There are two chances but what they have mentioned is B should not be placed at any of these places. So two chances for B ear or ear. Last point, the one who likes red color sits second to right of one who likes blue color. So blue right hand side. So blue right hand side at a second place which is red. So when just see here blue right hand side second place is red. If I fix blue here second right hand side this can be red. If I fix blue here second right hand side this can't be red. So only chance that I should fix blue ear. So blue right hand side. Second this must be red. If this is blue then this must be pink. And we already know that the person C likes green color. So only chance that I should fix C here and this must be green. So if I fix C here we know that between black and F no person is sitting. So this must be definitely F and B is not adjacent to A and this will be B. So everything has been fixed here by using one clue. So still only one more person is remaining that's that must be E because we already know that the person E is not sitting at the corner. So we can fix E here. So A B C D E F that's it. B blue right hand side second is red C green A is not pink or blue so what is the remaining one color that we have is black green white is remaining so white must be blue that's it right so this will be the answer for this arrangement let me check whether we are getting the same answer so blue See yes so this will be the answer for this arrangement right very interesting question so next arrangement so there are six person T st tox are sitting in a triangular table three of them sits at the corner and other three of them it sits at the middle right and some of them are facing the center and some of them so they didn't mention that the corner people are facing inside or outside they have mentioned that some of the people are facing the center and some of them were facing outside. So totally there are six person. Okay. So let it be. So corners each corner one one person and the side will be one one person. Right. So first point the one who works in TCS is immediate right of one who is working in Google. So what they have mentioned is Google immediate right must be the person who is working in TCS. But we don't know whether the Google is sitting at the corners. the person who liked Google is sitting in the corner or not but they have mentioned that so Google right hand side it must be TCS so this is the first clue what they have given in the question so second clue is X is working in infosys it's a direct statement where the person X is working in the infosys so X must be infosys right third point you and one who like one who works works in SBI both are in the opposite direction. Okay. So you and one who is working in SBI. So you as well as the person who is working in SBI both the person are facing the opposite direction. That means if one person is facing inside then the other person will be facing outside. So that means they are facing in the opposite direction. So W sits at the corner and faces the center. Yes, we got one direct clue. W is sitting at the corners and E is facing the center. So I can fix W here and the person W is facing the center. Okay. So next point is you sit second to left of S who faces outside? So the person S is facing outside. You sit second to left of S. That means S left hand side at a second place we have U. That's the point they have mentioned it. And then they have mentioned one point that the person s who is facing outside. So he's not facing inside he is facing outside. So yes again we will get many possibilities right because s left hand side second is u. No we we don't want to fix it. We can write down as a clue. So next point is s is an immediate neighbor of w. So s is an immediate neighbor of w. If I fix S here, S left hand side second is U. This can be U. No. Next point. Yes S is working in IBM. It's a direct statement. The one who is working in IBM is sits immediate to the left of V. Okay. So friends what they said is the one who is working in IBM sits to the immediate left of V. That means V left hand side immediately it must be F right that that that means S. So if I fix S here this must be V S is facing outside S left hand side second place. Now I think we will get multiple options. Sorry friends. Okay. So next point is T and W are facing the opposite direction. So T and W are facing the opposite direction. So here W is facing inside. So the person T will be facing outside. So still we didn't get any point direct loop. Okay. The one who is working in TCS and one who is working in IBM both are facing the same direction. So IBM as well as TCS both are facing the same direction. So that means here we already know that IBM is facing outside. So the person who is working in TCS will also be facing outside. So W sits third to right of X who is facing the center. Yes, again we got another one directly and that is the last point of the question. So W sits third to right of X. So X is facing inside. So the person X is facing inside and E is sitting W is sitting third to right of X. So I think I should fix X here. This must be facing inside only. Then we can say 1 2 3 right hand side at the third place is W. Right? And we know that X is an infosys. X is working and infosys. And now let's try to fix this point because the person S is facing outside and S left hand side second is U. So if I fix S ear outside facing outside left hand side second we can't able to fix U. So only chance that I should fix S here facing outside S left hand side second is U and this must be U. And we know that V left hand side is S. If V left hand side is S then this must be V. So V left hand side is S then V should be facing outside only. Then V left hand side can be S and this will be S and this will be IBM right and then T is facing outside. So only one places that we have remaining is this one and that the person T is facing outside and then U and SBI both are opposite direction. Here S is facing outside. So U will be definitely facing inside and we know that Google right hand side is TCS. So Google right right hand side is TCS. We have this can be Google and this can be TCS or else this can be Google or this can be TCS. We got two options right. So T is facing outside Google and TCS. Okay. So I think uh what they have mentioned is we sitting of S is an immediate neighbor of W. Okay. Okay. So we fixed most of the things. You and one who working in SBA both are facing in the opposite direction. Okay. So W sits at the corners. The one who likes works in six to W. U sits second to left of T. S is an immediate neighbor of W. Okay. So and S is working in IBM. The one who is working in IBM is immediate left of V. Yes. Immediate left of V is IBM. And then T and W are facing the opposite direction. Yes. T and W are facing opposite direction and then the one who is working in TCS both are facing the same direction. So TCS and IBM both are facing the same direction. See TCS and IBM both are facing the same direction. And TCS we already know that IBM person is facing outside. So now according to the question Google right hand side should be TCS. If I fix Google, this must be TCS. But TCS is not facing outside because SBI and the person who was S and the person who is working in TCS both are facing the same direction. That means this must be uh Google. So Google right hand side this must be TCS. Still we have two points. One is V and W. And we already know that one clue that W left hand side at a second place. The one who likes SBI is sitting because we didn't fix at the time. So I think this must be SBI right and one company which is remaining is what company is remaining Google IBM TCS Microsoft so W must be Microsoft yes so finally we have fixed the arrangement because all the clues has been directly given after after reading the final point of this arrangement we got all the clues right we we fixed all the clues in the arrangement so interesting but one area I struggle to fix Google and TCS because uh I forgot to write these two clues in a uh right way because we know that the person S is facing outside. So the person S as well as the person who is working and TCS both are facing the same direction. So we can't able to fix Google and TCS here because S is facing outside. TCS should also be facing outside. So Google and TCS and then we know that that point W left hand side at a second place who likes SBI is sitting. We didn't mention here but we know that this these place two places are there. So this will be the only place that W left second place must be SBI. So we fixed at this point and then finally we fixed the entire person in the arrangement. Right? So this will be the answer for this arrangement question. So finally in this video we have solved many triangle based seating arrangement. So practice more number of question like this right because even though they have not asked this triangular seating arrangement many times but when you take your bank exams or SSC exam they can ask you any type of seating arrangement. So in case in the upcoming exams if they ask a triangular seating arrangement try it right try to solve it it is easy. So once you learned I hope you feel this is not difficult thing it's a easy thing. So start practicing more number of question and don't forget to buy the test series of aptitude and reasoning and start practicing all the test which is inside it. So friends thank you so much for watching this video and if you really like it share this to your friends those are preparing for the exams. So thank you so much. Bye.",unknown
o3c7b-t_FwU,"So three subject the subject English is thought at least before three subjects. See the word at least you can able to see this word at least on the arrangement basically more on weak based seating puzzle as well as box arrangement at least three boxes are below box B at most two boxes are below box C. So this kind of word most important. So here first let's talk about at least. So at least means actually the meaning of at least is minimum to maximum. Right? So here what they said is the subject English is taught at least before three subject. That means minimum three right maximum. It can be anything minimum to maximum. The meaning of at least is minimum to maximum. Where the subject is English is taught at least before three subject that means before three subject where the English has been taught minimum three or before subject English has been taught before five subject English has been taught because that is called as at least. So if I fix it on Sunday that is not possible for English. Why? Because no subject were taught before English. If I fix on Saturday, Saturday as English, then only one subject has been taught before English. If I fix it English on Friday, only two subjects were taught. If I fix English on Thursday, yes, there are three subjects were taught before English has been taught. But this will be one case. Either English can be placed on Thursday or English can be placed on Wednesday, English can be on Tuesday, English can be on Monday. So all these places where English can be placed that is called as minimum three subject. If I fix on Thursday, minimum three subject where minimum three maximum it can be four or it can be five or it can be six. So minimum three, maximum six. So whenever you find the word at least in the seating arrangement be very careful. At least means minimum to maximum. At most means maximum to minimum plus none. So two words plays a major role in the seating arrangement. That too you can able to find it on weak based puzzle and then box based puzzle.",unknown
ESfUVR5KPtQ,"First of all, thanks for being here in my YouTube channel. So friends, if you are a regular follower of my channel. So do not forget to purchase my book quantitative aptitude book and start solving all the question what I have given in this book. Right? Because each and every question it's an art level question. Nowadays our competitive exam level or keep on increasing. So practice all the questions what I have given inside this book. If you have any doubt on purchasing it, do not forget to watch this video. In the unboxing video, I have told you what all the topics are there and where to buy this book everything. So, if you are a regular follower of feel free to learn, do not forget to purchase this book on our platform. So, now let me move on to the video. So, friends, now let me move on to the second video that is on the seating arrangement where we will be solving the question that is based on a week Monday to Sunday based arrangement. So after watching this video after a week right after seven days so the same question with additional of some sets totally 10 sets of weak arrangement will be added on the test package on aptitude and reasoning. So do not forget to practice the test if you are preparing for the competitive exams. So here we can learn. So after learning after a week or 10 days just write the test only then you can able to understand what is your level and how you have to improve the speed. So only by writing the test that comes there right. So now in this video just we can learn how to solve a question that is based on a weak puzzle. So friends, now getting into this week- based seating arrangement and if you are preparing for the bank exams or SSC exam, you can definitely able to see these kind of arrangement that is starting from Monday to Sunday totally there are seven people or six people. So joining in a classes and attending a classes on a different day of a week. So these kind of arrangement are more and more important. So always before solving these kind of arrangement right first read the initial passage of the question which is more important in this arrangement if it is a floor based puzzle or if it is a box based puzzle. So we can directly start reading from the clues. But in this case alone that is based on a week-based puzzle you have to be very careful whether the day starting from Monday to Sunday because in some question what they usually say is the day starts from Sunday to Saturday. So first you have to write Sunday and then Monday Tuesday. On some question they will mention Monday to Sunday and on some question they will not give you the total seven weeks they will give you only five days starting from Monday to Saturday. So we have to be very careful right how the data is given in the question and then only you have to start solving the question because only on these cases they will say totally there are seven days and one day will be off day. So off day means no activity will be done on some day. So we have to keep it as empty and then we have to solve the remaining days question right very interesting question. So here the concept called at least in in this case alone that is week based puzzle alone we can able to see the important word called at least at least two subject were thought at least four subjects or phone phones were released before this phone launched. So these kind of uh at least concept are more important in the weekdays. I think I have a question here. At last I will be solving a question that is based on an at least concept. So now let me move on to some of the seating arrangement puzzle on this video that is based on a week. So kindly just take a note and pen just by watching the video you two simultaneously try to solve the question so that you can understand where you are making a mistake and which point you are struggling to fix in a clue and usually you know what I usually do is if I have minimum possibility like two possible I will fix in the arrangement or maximum three if I if I get three possible I will draw in a diagram but if I get four or five possible I won't fix in diagram I will usually write it as the clue and then finally only I used to fix it. So similarly we can solve all the question that is based on the week based seating arrangement. So here is the first seating arrangement. So six person namely P2 start their journey for office from Pune to Bangalore on a different day starting from Monday to Sunday and on the day they are like on a different timing they are leaving the home. So from Pune to Bangalore 9:00, 12:00, 2:00 etc. And just listen carefully totally there are only six person but they have given starting from Monday and ends on Sunday. So there is a one day off will be there where no person is traveling to the office. Right? Very important always read the question completely and then fix whether the day is starting from Monday or the day is starting from Tuesday etc. Right? So here the day starts from Monday so till Sunday and we have one day as an off that is holiday no one is traveling on that day to the office. So now there are totally six person our target is to find which person is traveling on which day and at what timing in case if we get too possible I will fix in the arrangement. So now let's start reading the clues. So P goes immediately before T. So P is going immediately before T and that means it's it's a direct loop right. So P is going immediately before T. So before T we have P. But we can't able to fix in this year because we will get many possible. So first let me take it as a clue. Second point the day on which no person goes from Pune to Bangalore is after the day on which tea goes. Not immediately after it's just after the day on which tea goes. Right? So after the day someday after the day only the off day is coming. So after the day the t goes where the off day will be there but not immediately after it's just after at some point right again we can't able to fix it in this clue because we will get more possible if I fix P year T year any one place can be the off day. So but we don't want to fix it we can read the remaining point here. Right? So there is a gap of two day between the day on which the person goes and P goes. So when just just listen the word carefully. There are a gap of two day between on the day which no person goes and P goes. So no person goes and P goes. There is a gap of two days. We already know that P is immediately before T. And now what they are saying is no person goes and the person P is going between these two persons right where the gap is two. So now we can fix P T one person will be there and no person is going. If I fix P here this will be T and this will be no person going and this will this will be one empty place and this will be no person going or else no person going will be placed here. So again we are getting many possible but this is one of the direct clue right okay so second point P goes to P goes at uh Bangalore on 11:00 on the day we have given a direct clue that P is going at a time of 11:00 so P has been given that is 11:00 here so next point S who goes at 2:00 is not going on Monday and Tuesday so Monday and Tuesday where the person S is not going but what they have mentioned here is the person S U goes at 2:00 so the person S is going at 2:00 that has been mentioned here so next point U goes at 6:00 R goes at 12:00 that is also they have given directly so U goes at 6:00 and R goes at 12:00 but neither nor Friday nor Saturday that means the person Friday as well as Saturday the person U is not going R is not going. U and R both the person are not going to the office on Friday as well as Saturday and what timing they are going is directly given here right but again we can't able to fix because these are the chances for you and R we are getting many possibles let it be let we let we try for the other cases. So next point is Sunday is not that day on which no person goes and the timing of the person who goes on Sunday is 9:00. So what they are saying is Sunday is no person going will not be here but the person who is going on Sunday he is going to the office at 9:00. So they have mentioned the timing here that means Sunday will not be the off day. So I think Saturday can be the off day and the Friday can be the off day. Any any one of the day can be the off day. Right. Okay. So, still one more point is remaining I think. So, the day on which a person goes at 6:00 is immediately before the day where no person is going. So, what they are saying is the person who is going at the 6:00 he is going immediately before the day where the no person is going. We know that the person who is go going at sharp at 6:00 is you. So now what they are saying is the person U is immediately before the no person going. So that means this will be the place for you. So finally we read the complete question. Still we have fixed only one point that is Sunday 9:00. We have written all the clues here. So now let's try to fix on this arrangement. Just friends just see here Ptx right X means no person is going. We already know that Sunday is not the no person going day, right? If I fix no person going going day year, if I fix this as an off day, then immediately before off day, it should be U. But we should not place U here. This is not possible. Now what we can do is we can fix this as an off day. Right? If I fix this as an off day, then this will be U. If this is U and this should be T and this should be P. One case or else if I fix Thursday as an off day then this will be U. This will be T and this will be P. So finally we get two possibles right? So I have fixed both the possible cases here. So now we know that P is 11:00 right? P is in 11:00 and what all the remaining value they have given us? U 6:00. So U will be 6:00. Okay. So now let's fix the R. R is 12:00, right? R will be 12:00 and then U S. Okay. Now let's try to fix R and S here because we have fixed most of the point. Just listen here. If I take R, right? I should fix R only at this point. Why? Because we already know that R should not be placed at Saturday. And if I fix R here, this should be 12:00. But we already fixed it as 9:00. So only one chances for R. R should be placed here and this should be 12:00. And we know that this is the place is not for S. So I should place only S here which is 2:00. Right? And then remaining what letter that we have remaining is Q. So Q should be fixed here 9:00 and only one timing is remaining which is 4:00. I think we got the answer in the first case itself. Right? I think this is the answer for this question. But again, we have another possible here. So let's try to fix it. So when just see here we have to fix R which should be 12:00. I can't able to fix R here. 12 is not possible. These two places are not for R and I can't able to fix anywhere else R. So this arrangement is completely possibility is completely eliminated because there is no place to fix for R. So only one chance that This will be the first possible is the answer for the question where R P T U SQ let let me check the answer once R PTU no person going and then SQ so 9:00 2:00 6:00 4:00 11:00 12:00 yes this is the answer right see how slowly we solve the question in the exams you should not solve this much slowly where you can't able to solve it on time but remember one While practicing practice like this write down the clue separately and see out of the clue which clue is more important and which clue will get minimum possible. I I fix this clue because after reading all the point we got this point as the major clue. So I tried to fix this clue here and then write down the possibility cases. I got two possibility cases. Right? Out of this two possibility cases in the first possibility I got the answer. in the second possibility where I can't able to fix R so that will be wrong the first possibility will be correct so once you keep on practicing like this automatically the speed will be coming right you can able to solve within 2 minutes or 3 minutes this kind of arrangement so practice is more needed again do not watch this video just by uh you you just watch this video similarly by practicing right just watch the video take a note and pen simultaneously practice with So that you will learn something newly on this video right by just watching you can't able to learn anything by simultaneously if you two solve the arrangements definitely you can learn more things here right so now this will be the answer for the first set of arrangement question so here is the second set of arrangement so rago joined the class from Monday to Sunday on the same week for the different subject biology chemistry so totally they have given seven subject So that means there is no off day and where the days are starting from Monday to Sunday. So now let let's fix here. So Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday. So totally there are seven days and all the seven days he's attending the class. Right? Okay. So now let me start reading the clues. So the first clue in the class is taken by him on Wednesday. So he is taking Hindi class on Wednesday which is the direct statement. So I can fix Wednesday as an Hindi class. So Hindi class will be taken on Wednesday. So next point there are one gap between Hindi class and mathematics class. So there is a gap between Hindi and mathematics that is one. We already fixed in the year either mathematics should be at the top or mathematics should be at the bottom. So we can go with two possible because we have getting only two minimum possibles. So I can fix max here or else I can fix max here. So between Hindi and max there is a gap of one. So next point is and there are three gap between mathematics and English class. So between mathematics and English there is a gap of three. So already I fix max ear. So 1 2 3 and this is the place for English. If I fix max ear 1 2 3 and this is the place for English. So between max and English in both the cases where we have a gap of three subjects. So next point English class is scheduled immediately before physics but the class is not on Monday. So most important point here just look at the point English class is scheduled immediately before physics. So immediately before physics we have English class but this English class is not on Monday. Then what are all the possible cases here? I have already fixed English at the case one. So only place for physics will be on Saturday. So now second possibility is we already fixed English and only possible chance I should fix physics year but they have mentioned in the point the English class should not be on Monday. So this possible is completely wrong because here I'm getting English on Monday. So this is wrong. I think we have only three subjects remaining and one more point is remaining at the end. There is one gap between chemistry classes scheduled immediately after mathematics. I think it's a direct point immediately after mathematics it's chemistry. So this is the place for chemistry. And then last point there is one gap between chemistry class and geography class and the biology class is scheduled on Sunday. So it's directly given where the biology class is scheduled on Sunday. So this will be biology and at last they have mentioned that chemistry and geography one already I have fixed chemistry here and this should be geography it's not a difficult puzle I think it's a easy level puzle but to understand the concept clearly here right so between one gap immediately above so you have to know all these stuff and one point I think 1 2 3 fourth point fourth point is important because English class is immediately before physics and English is not on Monday. Don't think physics is not on Monday. English is not on Monday. If English is not on Monday, then the second possibility case is completely eliminated. So by using that point clue, we fix the first possible is correct. So answer for the second set of arrangement where let me check the answer once. Max, chemistry, Hindi, geography, English, physics and biology. Yes, we are getting the answer correctly. So this will be the answer for the second set of seating arrangements. So here is the third set of seating arrangement. So there are seven person A to G are going to the market on a different day starting from Monday to Sunday but not necessarily in the same order again. So totally you can able to see there are seven person and the days will be starting from Monday to Sunday that means no off day will be there and our target is to find which person going to the market on which day as well as I think we have to find the color of the person what he likes right so we have to find the two datas here the person and the color so be very careful every question will not be always starts from Monday that's what I'm repeatly saying sometimes it will starting from Tuesday to Saturday. So you have to be very careful by reading the questions. So now let's target the first clue here. So C is going to the market just before. What is called just before? Before is different. Just before is different. Just before means immediately before, right? So before means it can be at any places before C. But here what they are saying is C is going to the market just before F. That means immediately before F C is going. So always remember the word just before means immediately before and who likes purple color. So the person F likes purple color. This was directly given. And this is the first clue. Immediately before F it should be C. I should not fix in the clue because we will get multiple possibles. So let me move on to the remaining points. Still many points are there. So G is going to the market on Friday where it's a direct clue where G is going to the market on Friday. So next point is there is one gap between G and one who is going with who likes white color. So G and white color there is a gap of one. So now we can fix in the possible cases because either white should be placed here one chance or else G and this must be white. So only two possible I'm getting. So between G and the person who likes white there is a gap of one. So next point is there are two day gap between the person one who likes uh Azil and white. So white and asel there is a gap of two. So we already fixed white here one and two this must be asel right and similarly there should be a gap of two. So 1 two is not possible. So one and two this must be. So in both the cases between white and the color as we have a gap of two. So next point is the one who likes violet color is going to the market just before the day B and just after the day A. So very interesting. See just before means the word just represents immediately. Right? So now what they are saying is the person who likes violet color is going to the market just before B. So before B, immediately before B, the person who likes violet color is going and this person, the person who likes violet color is going to the market immediately after A. So immediately after A, immediately before B, the person who likes violet color is going. So this is the I think this will be the important clue here in the question because they have mentioned it as just before just before, immediately before, immediately after. Right? So we don't want to fix here. We can still we have some more points remaining. So B and G does not like Azil and white color. So B and G does not like uh Azel and white color. So uh this place will not be Azil as well as we already fixed to white, right? So G will not G will not like Azel color and B will not be Azel as well as white. So these two colors does not like by the person B and G does not like Azel and violet. I'm sorry it's violet right? So Azil and violet and this G does not like Azil as well as violet. So next point, the one who likes blue color is going to the market before one of the day who likes pink color. It's not just before, it's before, right? So before uh the person who likes blue color is going before the person who likes pink color. So before pink color, it should be blue but not immediately, right? Not immediately before. And the last point, E likes yellow color. So E likes yellow color. So that's it right. So finally we read all the points and I have noted down some of the clues here. So after reading the complete question we can able to fix only these datas. So now what's the target by using the clue? Our target is to fix here. I think after writing all the clues here just see the major clue will be this because this I think this by fixing it I think we will get minimum possibles. Let's fix and see. So, a violet b right. So, if I fix a ear here, this will not be violet, right? We can't able to fix a. If I fix a ear here, this should be violet. And we already know that the person g does not like violet. So, we can't able to fix here. If I fix a ear here, this must be violet. If I fix a ear, this must be violet and this must be b. But we already know that the person b does not like asel. So only chance that I should fix A here and this must be violet and this must be B. This will be the first case. So moving on to the next case again I can't able to fix A here. Not possible. If I fix A here this will be violet. Not possible. I think here also I'm getting a violet and this must be B. So in both the cases we have fixed A violet and then B. This case is completely fixed. So now getting into this point immediately before F we have C. Immediately before F we have C. If I fix F here F is already a purple color. I can't able to fix. Only chance that I should fix F here. This must be purple and uh before it should be C. I'm sorry. This is also not the place for purple. Right? Because if I fix purple here immediately before should be C. I think in this first possible case we don't have any option to fix right because f is purple and immediately before purple it should be c no I think uh I'm not getting answer in the first possible case let me move on to the second possible if I fix already fixed I think only one chance here is f should be purple and this should be c no other way right we don't have any options here and then what is the remaining point that we have is before pink we should have blue right before pink we should have blue and we have if I pink if I fix pink pink here this should be blue and we already know that one person E likes yellow so I can't fix anywhere else here only one place this should be E and this should be yellow and we already know that before pink we have blue so this must be pink and this must be blue and still one letter is remaining. A, B, C, D is remaining. I think D should be violet. That's it right. Yes. So friends, finally interesting uh sitting arrangement. So finally we fixed it. Totally you can able to see a blue. Let me check the answer. While blue, violet, white, yellow, blue, violet, white, yellow, pink as and purple. Yes. A D B E G C F Yes S Yes S Yes S it's correct. So finally we got an answer and the second possible case the first possible case we got wrong. Why? Because there is no place to fix for F and C. We know F is purple but there is no place to fix for F. If I fix F here this should be C. If I fix F here this is the place for purple. So we can't able to fix anywhere else in the first case. So in the second case we got the answer right. So be very slow while solving the arrangement. Surely you will get the answer right. But be consistent and write the clues properly. Right? Just see I have written all the clues in a proper way. After reading the complete question I just check what are all the clues I have fixed already and what are all the clues that we need to still fix it here. and then I found what is the major possible case. So this will be the major case and then I try to fix the arrangement and then I try to got the answer. So this is the way practice more number of question. So finally this will be the answer for this seating arrangement puzzle. So next set of puzzle. So a person was played six different games. So bat mitten basketball. So totally there are six games and starting from Monday to Saturday that means Sunday was not given totally six days and totally there are six games right so let's let's draw this so Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday and Saturday right but Sunday was not given here so our target is to find the person plays which game on which day that is our target here so first point so cricket was played neither on the first day nor on the last day that means first day and last day they didn't play cricket so this will not be the place for cricket and this will not be the place for cricket right so next point baseball was played just before the day when bat mitten was played and just after the day the cricket was played see the same sort of thing we have seen in the previous question also I think the color based before a violet and after uh Sorry. Before B violet, after a violet. So the same sentence, right? Just see the sentence here. So baseball. So the baseball was played. So baseball was played just what they saying is baseball played just before the day of batmitten. So before the day of batmitten it it it was baseball and after the day of cricket. So just after just before that means before immediately before batmitten it should be baseball and immediately after cricket it should be baseball right and then there are one gap between oi there are two gap between football and baseball. So football baseball there is a two gap. So what I can do here is I think we can fix in the clue why because we know that so cricket should not be on Monday as well as cricket should not be played on Sunday. So what all the remaining places cricket can be. If I fix example I'm saying if I fix cricket here this must be baseball right and this must be bat mitten or else I can place cricket here this must be baseball and this must be bat mitten and similarly we will be getting another one possible so this can be cricket and this can be a baseball and this can be bat mitten so I can I can fix and see why because I'm getting only three possible in case if I'm getting four or five possible I will not fix it but here I get only three chances so I just fix and going to check which will be the correct one and what are the next point there are two gaps between football and baseball so between football and baseball there is a two gap so one and two this must be football year and similarly baseball and football there is a two gap and this must be football in this case one two and this must be football so in all the three possible cases between baseball and Football there is a gap of two games. And last there is one gap between hockey and basketball. Oi and basketball there should be gap of one. Right? If I fix a year I should fix basketball here. But already baseball is here. Right? So oy and basketball one gap there is no chance for the first case and the second case also only two places remaining that two between we have a gap of three. So this is also not possible. only this area is possible. I should fix a uh bat mitten ear, basketball ear and I think only this possible will be correct. And last point what they said is oki was not played on Wednesday. If a was not played on Wednesday then definitely hockey should be on Monday and basket should be on Wednesday. No other way between hockey and basketball there should be gap of one. So I fixed here I think out of three possible the last possible is correct. Let me check the answer. Hockey football, basketball, cricket, baseball and batm. Yes. So this will be the answer for the seating arrangement puzzle. Very interesting right? So why I fixed here is in the in the case directly because I get three chances. We already know that totally there are only Monday to Saturday right? Sunday was not there totally six days and out of six days one day the cricket was not played so remaining will be 5 days so I started fixing it so cricket can be on Tuesday Wednesday and Thursday but not on Friday right if if there is Sunday right then I won't fix that because you will get multiple possibles right so I will not fix it if I'm getting three possible then I can surely go with the possible cases and I used to check the answer so finally answer for this arrangement will be hockey football basketball, cricket, baseball and batm. This will be the answer for this arrangement set. So next set of arrangement a faculty teaches seven subject. So reasoning, quan, zapi starting from Monday to Sunday and each subject on one day. So totally they have given seven subject and all the subject has been taught on a different day. So totally they have given seven days. So Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday. So now this is the question where I have told you initially right the word at least will plays a major role on these kind of arrangement. Right? So now the first point so three subject the subject English is thought at least before three subjects. See the word at least. You can able to see this word at least on the arrangement. Basically more on weak based seating puzzle as well as box arrangement. At least three boxes are below box B. At most two boxes are below box C. So this kind of word most important. So here first let's talk about at least. So at least means actually the meaning of at least is minimum to maximum. Right? So here what they said is the subject English is taught at least before three subject that means minimum three right maximum it can be anything minimum to maximum the meaning of at least is minimum to maximum where the subject is English is taught at least before three subject that means before three subject where the English has been taught minimum three or before four subject English has been taught before five subject English has been taught because that is called as at least. So if I fix it on Sunday that is not possible for English. Why? Because no subject were taught before English. If I fix on Saturday, Saturday as English, then only one subject has been taught before English. If I fix it English on Friday, only two subjects were taught. If I fix English on Thursday, yes, there are three subjects were taught before English has been taught. But this will be one case. Either English can be placed on Thursday or English can be placed on Wednesday, English can be on Tuesday, English can be on Monday. So all these places where English can be placed that is called as minimum three subject. If I fix on Thursday, minimum three subject where minimum three maximum it can be four or it can be five or it can be six. So minimum three, maximum six. So whenever you find the word at least in the seating arrangement be very careful at least means minimum to maximum. At most means maximum to minimum plus none. So two words plays a major role in the seating arrangement that two you can able to find it on weak based puzzle and then box based puzzle. So now let me move on to the remaining points here. Right. So I think we don't want to draw any possible diagram here because uh there are four four possibles we are getting it. So let it be. Let me move on to the next point. So the subject scient science is thought on Tuesday. So Tuesday is science. It's a direct statement. We already know that only four places are there for English. So now this place is got eliminated. So only one place is there that is on science which is on Tuesday. So English can be on Monday, Wednesday or Thursday. Right? So what are all the remaining points here is both the subject quant and the computer or thought at least before one subject. Again at least before one subject that means minimum one subject before one subject thought where quants and computer should be there. So that that means the quant and computer should not be on Sunday. Why? Because if quant and computer is on Sunday so before these two topics where at least one subject should be taught. If I fix quant here then no subject will be taught before Sunday. Right? So definitely I think quant should be placed here. One subject will be taught after this or quant placed here. So any of these places where you can fix quant and computer but quan should not be placed on Sunday and computer should not be placed on Sunday. That is the meaning of it. What they are saying is both the subject quant and the computer are thought at least before one subject. That means minimum one subject should be there before it. So now what are all the remaining things are there? The subject GA is thought immediately after the subject English. So after immediately English it should be GA. So I think I should not fix English here. Why? Because if I fix English here, this must be GA. But already we have fixed science here. So this is not the place for English. I think we will get two possible. If I fix English here, this must be GA. If I fix English here, this must be GA. Yes or no? Only two cases that we are getting. If I fix English here, this will be GA. Or else if I fix English here, this will be GA. And we know that science is on Tuesday. So finally we have drawn two possible cases. One English should be on Wednesday. Second English should be on Thursday. So next two point is at least four subject or thought after the subject computer. So at least four subject or thought after the subject computer. That means after computer we should have minimum of four subject. So I should not fix computer here. If I if I fix computer here then at least four we have we have seen only one gap is here. So computer should not be placed here. In this case I should fix only one place that should be computer because at least what they have said is at least four subject or thought after the subject computer. So after the subject computer at least four. So here if I fix 1 2 3 4 here it can be computer or here it can be computer because if I fix computer here at least four subject after it. If I fix computer here after four subject computer. So in the second possibility case there are two possible computer can be placed here or computer can be placed here. So next point is there is one gap between quants and computer. So between quant and computer there is a gap of one. We already fixed computer here. There is no place to fix quant. So we can say this possible is completely eliminated. So now we got that either computer should be placed here or computer should be placed here. If I place computer this will be quant. If I place computer this will be quant. So that means these are the two places for computer and quant. Right? And the last point three subject are thought between computer and marketing. So between computer and marketing there is a gap of three. So if I fix computer here I can't able to fix marketing. So this will be the only place for computer and this will be quant and between computer and marketing there must be gap of three and only one subject is remaining which will be reasoning. That's it. So I think we have finally fixed it right. The first possible case is completely wrong. We are getting the answer in the second possible cases. Let me check once again whether the answer is correct. Quan science, computer, English, GA, reasoning and marketing. Yes, this is correct. So friends, always remember that uh the question which contains at least you can see more on weak puzzle, box puzzle. I'm repeatedly saying this. Why? Because I have seen students usually make a mistake only on the word at least and at most because uh the question starting itself you can see at least two boxes are kept below box B. That means below box B. It can be two box or below box B. It can be three box, four box, five box, six box based upon the maximum number. Right? So if you find the word at least be careful on solving it. So friends, thank you so much for watching this video and if you really like it, share the video to your friends those who are preparing for the competitive exams and by watching the video again after a week try to write the test. Only if you write the test you will get the speed and time management because you have to solve these kind of questions in your competitive exam within 2 to 3 minutes. So if you want to solve there now itself you have to sit and practice. So don't forget to take the test. So friends, thank you so much for watching it. Bye.",unknown
ta-twRuBPbw,"First of all, thanks for being here in my YouTube channel. So friends, if you are a regular follower of my channel. So do not forget to purchase my book quantitative aptitude book and start solving all the question what I have given in this book. Right? Because each and every question it's an art level question. Nowadays our competitive exam level or keep on increasing. So practice all the questions what I have given inside this book. If you have any doubt on purchasing it, do not forget to watch this video. In the unboxing video, I have told you what are all the topics are there and where to buy this book everything. So if you are a regular follower of feel free to learn, do not forget to purchase this book on our platform. So now let me move on to the video. So friends, now let me move on to this reasoning ability seating arrangement session. Right. So inside a seating arrangement we have the first category that is important category box arrangement. So here in this video we are going to solve 10 box arrangement. So friends do one thing just by playing the video simultaneously. You two take a note and a pen and start solving a question. So we both can solve all the 10 sets without any timing. Right? Even if you take 10 minutes or 20 minutes not a problem. But you are going to learn here in this video total 10 sets of box arrangement. And remember one thing the same 10 sets of box arrangement will be available in the test also. First learn take a week of time one week of time and then write the same question as a test by just in the time management one practice set 3 minutes. So total 10 sets 30 minutes. So that for your competitive exams either you are writing SSC, railway or banking whatever be you will get a perfect practice if you solve like this. First we are going to learn here after a week start writing the test so that you will automatically get a practice right. So now let me move on to all the 10 practice sets of the box arrangement. So kindly take a note and pen. Let's solve all the question. So here is the first box arrangement. So let me move on to this question now. So totally there are six boxes A to F with the different colors. So our target is to find which box is of which color. So totally we have six boxes. So if you wish you can draw write down the numbers like 1 2 3 4 5 and six. Some students won't write this. It's not a problem but you have wish right? So if you are preparing for the first time do like this and then start solving a question. So now what is the first point? Box C is placed just above the orange color box. So above the orange color box it is box C. So we don't want to fix in this diagram because we will get more number of possibilities because orange C if you fix orange here this will be C. So you don't want to fix in this diagram. So let me move on to this diagram here. So above orange color box we have box C. So what about the next point? One box is placed between A and an orange color. So between A and orange color there is a gap of one box. So either we can place A here A and orange color we have a gap of one box or else orange A. So in these two possible cases where you can see between orange and A we have a gap of one box. So what about the next point? So three boxes are placed between A and the pink color box. So between A and the pink color there is a gap of three boxes. So we already fixed A here. So if I fix A here 1 2 3 so this will be pink. If we fix A here 1 2 3 and this will be pink. So in this possible case where you can able to see if I fix a here this will be pink. If I fix a here this will be pink. only then we can say between A and pink there must be a gap of three boxes. Okay. So still we have some more points remaining. So two boxes are placed between D and E. So between D and E we have a gap of two boxes. So if I fix D here 1 to this will be E. We are getting many possible. Let let write this as a clue. So between this can also be like this right because between D and E there is a gap of two boxes and if I fix here I'm getting more possibility. So I'm not going to fix I have written at it as a clue. Next point so red box is placed just below A. Just below A. It should be red box. So we already know that for A we have two possibilities. Either I can fix A here or A here. If I fix a here, this will be red. If I fix a here, this will be red because just below A, it's a red color box. And we know that totally there are only six boxes. So if I fix red here, for example, I'm saying if I fix red here, one box 2 3 4 5 6. So I think we can directly fix in this diagram. Why? Because I can't able to fix a because if I fix a here, this should be red. There is no chance. So only chance that I should fix A here. This must be red color box. And between A and pink color box, we have a gap of three boxes. So A 1 2 3 and this will be pink. And we already fixed C and then orange. Right? C and orange is already fixed. So this will be the one possible diagram. Or else we know that A can also be placed here. If I fix A here 1 2 3 and this will be pink. So below A C and orange no changes and we already know that below A the red color box is placed. So below A this will be red. So finally we have two possible cases where I can fix A in the second box or else a at the sixth box. So now let me move on to some of the points here between D and D there is a gap of two. Okay let me move on to the next point. So what they are saying is there are many boxes placed as many boxes placed above the red color box as below E. What is the meaning of it? Just read the line. There are as many boxes placed above the red color box below E. That means the total number of boxes above red color that should be equal to below E. Right? So for example here in this possible diagram we have fixed red here. Above red how many boxes are there? 1 2 3 4 5 five boxes. So now below E it should also have five boxes. So where should I place E is this is the one chance because above red 1 2 3 4 5 below E 1 2 3 4 5. So only chance that I should fix E here in this possible diagram. Above red only one box. So below E it should be also be one box right? Then only chance that I should fix E here. So that is the meaning of that point above E. How many boxes are there? That is above red. It should be equal to number of boxes below E. So here in this possible case above red there are five boxes. Below E there are five boxes. Here above red we have only one box. Below E it should also have only one box. So only chance I should fix E here. Right? So and we already know that if I fix E then I can fix D because between E and D there should be gap of two. So one and two and this should be D. 1 and two this should be D because between E and D there should be a gap of two. So only chance I should fix D here but already we have fixed C. So this possible diagram is completely wrong. So only one diagram that we have this will be the correct. So still some of the colors need to be fixed. Right? So what are the remaining points? E is of not orange color. Yes, E is of not orange color. E is a pink color here. So next point black color box is placed just above yellow color. So above yellow color it should be a black color box. So yellow only chance that I should fix yellow here and yellow this should be black. And still one more color is remaining which is white. So this must be white. And still two box letter is remaining. I think last only one point we have is f is placed above b. So above B F. So definitely above B it should be F. So this must be F. That's it. I think we have placed all the boxes as well as the their colors. So B red, A yellow, D black, F orange, C white and E pink. Yes, we got the answer correctly. Right. See I I didn't stuck anywhere else in this arrangement. Why? Because I have read the complete sentence point by point. If there is a clue I have written separately. If I can fix I have fixed in this arrangement and then I fixed in the direct arrangement only if we know it will not have more number of possibilities. So here I have solved this complete arrangement only by fixing one clue that is A and pink. Yes or no? By using this A and pink we have two chances because between A and pink there should be a gap of three box and A will not be at the bottom. Why? Because if I fix a at the bottom below A we have another box that is red. So definitely A will not be at the bottom. So A will be here. Between A and red or between A and red only two chances that we have. So by fixing A and pink. Sorry A and red not red A and pink. So between A and pink there is a gap of three boxes. Only by using the clue we have fixed the entire arrangement. So practice like this. Just check which clue we will get only minimum number of possibles. fix the clue in the arrangement and try to find out the answer. Right? If you go with any other options then we will get more number of possibilities and it takes much time. So we have to solve it in 3 minutes one arrangement that should be a target always two or 3 minutes. So if you need to solve that in 2 or 3 minutes if it is not a direct statement write it as a separate clue and try to fix one important clue will definitely there in the arrangement. Try to fix that and try to solve it. Okay. So this will be the answer for the first set of box arrangement. So here is the second box arrangement. So there are 11 boxes placed one above the other. So five boxes are placed between F and T. See they didn't mention that what all the boxes are there. Let us haven't mentioned here but they have mentioned that totally there are 11 boxes and then first point itself they start giving the clues. So no problem just write down this 11 numbers because sometimes it might help you while practicing initially write like this and then if you practice more number of questions so these steps are not needed. Okay so totally there are 11 boxes and the first point itself they are saying that five boxes are placed between f and t. So between f1 and t we have a gap of five boxes. So either f and t can be placed like this or else t and f because between t and f or f and t there is a gap of five boxes. And the next point not more than five boxes are kept above t. That means above t it can be one box or it can be two box 3 4 5 but it should not be sorry I'm extremely sorry it should not be more than right it should not be more than five. So it should not be six but about t it can be 2 3 etc. But when you take this condition above t itself we have five boxes and then f will be the another box. So totally about t we will get six boxes in this condition. So this will be completely wrong. So only condition that we have is t should be at the top. F should be at the bottom. So between t and f there should be gap of five boxes. So this will be the only condition. So we can fix t here 1 2 3 4 and 5. So between T and F there should be a gap of five boxes but F will not be at the top. Why? Because above T there should not be more than five boxes. Right? Next point two boxes are kept between T and M. So between T and M there should be gap of two boxes. So I think we will get two possibility either I can fix M here or else one and two I can fix M here. Between T and M there should be gap of two boxes. Next point, three boxes are kept between M and S. And M is kept at one of the position above S. That means above S, it should have a box M. Between M and S, there should be a gap of three boxes. Right? We already fixed the boxes here. So S will not be at the top. S will be at the bottom. So 1 2 and three box. So this must be S. Between M and S, there is a gap of three box. In case if I fix m here, we can't able to uh put the box above it because we already know that s above only it should be m. So 1 2 and three. This is the possible way. So totally between m and s itself we are having two possibilities. Let me try to fix here. If I fix okay let let's take m at the top. Right? If I take m at the top 1 2 this must be t and this must be s or else I can put m here one and two again we are getting multiple options right. Okay, let it be once if I have a definite clue then I can fix and see. What is the next point here is there are only just look at this clue. There are only three boxes are kept above J. That means above J we have exactly three boxes. So definitely there is a only chance that I should fix a J at the eighth position only then we can say above J we have exactly three boxes. So now I think we can fix T here because between T and F we know that there should be a gap of five boxes, right? T and F 1 2 3 4 5. Okay, what I can do here is I can fix T here in this possible diagram 1 2 3 4 5 boxes and this must be F. No other way because between T and F there should be gap of five. And then I think we have multiple option. We can't able to fix T here. Let let's do one thing. I can fix all the remaining here or else I can draw another diagram also. T 1 2 3 4 5 this must be F. Right? Two possibilities. And we know that between T and M there is a gap of two. So we can't able to fix M here. T and M 1 and two this must be M. So now let me move on to this possible 1 and two this must be M. And we have to place S below M. And between S and M there should be gap of three. So 1 2 and three. So I can fix S here. 1 2 3. Here 1 2 3 and I can fix S here. So finally we are getting two possibles. Okay. Let me read the remaining points. One box is kept between R and S. Between R and S there is a gap of one box. I can't able to fix R here. Only chance R and S one box. Here we already fixed S. I can't able to fix R here. Only chance that between S and R there must be a gap of one box. Two boxes are kept between R and H. I think here in this possible diagram where we can't able to fix H because between R and H there should be a gap of two box. It is not possible. So now I can fix H here. I can fix H here. We are getting two possibilities. Let it be. Let me move on to the next point. So box D is kept at one of the position below K. Okay. What they are saying is box D is kept one of the position below K. So below K it should have a box D. Not immediately below below K. Right? Somewhere but below K it should have D box and one of the position above C. So above C it should have D. Not immediately above but should be above. Right? So a D box should be placed below K and above C. Okay. So again we will have a multiple options here. Okay. Let me move on to the remaining points as well. So what are all the remaining points that we have here is the last one point box E is kept immediately above K. Box E is kept immediately above K. Immediately above K. It should be E. I think only one possible that we have is K and this must be E. No other way because immediately above K it should be E. And we already know that K below it should be D and above C it should be D. Right? So K below it should be D. And we already know that they have we have already missed one point that is H. So now we know that we have two options. So either H should be placed here or H should be placed here. But now they have mentioned the point that between R and H two boxes are kept between R and H. So R and H we can't able to fix here. No other way. Only one chance that I should fix H here. Only then we can say that below D it should be C. So I should fix D and I should fix C because if I fix D and C here itself if I put H here and if I fix D and C they mentioned that point which is not above R. Above R it should not be C. So above R it can be D above R it should not be C. So no possible I can't able to fix H here. Only chance should be H should be placed here and D is below K and D is above C and C should not be above R. So below R right that's it. So finally we got the answer for this arrangement and remember one thing while reading the question we didn't have a proper clue only one clue direct clue has been given one is J. So first I have written the J and then I have targeted the minimum possible case. So the minimum possible case will be between this point between T and F there is a gap of five. So if I fix here I will get only minimum chances because I can only fix T here because if I fix T here I can't able to place F. So only two or three chances either T or either T two possible chance because if I fix T here M will not be possible. If I fix T here again M is not possible. So only way either the T should be placed below J or above J. Right? So first I fixed below J T and we are not getting a exact for R and H. So only above J it's correct. And then I'm getting R and H alone. Finally we add a confusion where to fix H. At this point they have given a clue that D should be placed below K and D should be placed above C but this C should not be above R. So it should be placed below it and only one portion remaining that is H. So we have fixed H here. So clues are most important and only if we have a direct clue fix on the arrangement or else write like this write separately wherever you find any clue separately and then try to fix it on a diagram. So only then you can able to solve the question fastly. If you want to solve it in fastly or 3 minutes then definitely practice is more needed. Even if you are taking more time to solve this question now not at all a problem let's learn let's we learn all the concepts clearly right and then while writing the test you will automatically feel and you will automatically see the fastness on the preparation right so now this will be the answer for second set of box arrangement so here is the next set of box arrangement so totally there are seven boxes S2 I are placed one above the other so not in an order, right? So, not in the same order. It's in a different order and box number one is at the bottom and box number seven is at the top. So, here in this case, they have given box one is at the bottom and the box 7 is at the top. It is always helpful to write all the numbers here. So, 1 3 4 5 6 and 7. Why? Because in some cases they will say like this box is not kept on the topmost or this box is not kept on the bottom. So there the numbers are required. So if they have given a numbers write the numbers that will be helpful in most of the cases right. So now let me move on to the first clue what they have given. So three boxes are placed between I and M. So between I and M there is a gap of three boxes. So I think I 1 2 3 and M one possible chance or else M 1 2 and three this must be I. So between I and M there should be gap of three boxes. So next M is placed on the place above S which is which does not place on an odd number floor. That means the box S is does not place on an odd number. So S must be definitely an even number box somewhere at the even number but above S it should be M. Not immediately above above S it should be M. And we already know that between M and I there should be a gap of three boxes. and S is not placed on an odd number. So S must be somewhere in the even position. Right? S can be placed here or S can be placed here or S can be placed here. So these are the different ways where we can place S. So now next point I think we don't want to fix here because we will get many possibilities. So now let me move to the next point. So P is neither placed on an odd number nor on the topmost. So P is not on an odd number. Also P is not on the topmost. So P is not on the topmost. Similarly P will not be on the fifth position. P will not be on the third position. As well P will not be on the first position. So all these places are on odd number places where we can't able to fix P. As well as P is not on the top more. Okay, topmost is an odd number. Right? So next point I does not place on the bottommost. So I is not on the bottommost. So friends, I think we will get a one clue that if I is placed not placed on the bottommost, so definitely this is not the place for I. So I can fix I here and then 1 2 3 this must be M. One possible case. If I is not at the bottom, M can be at the bottom. If I fix M here, 1 2 3 and this can be I. But we already know one important thing. Yes, above only we have M. So M is not placed on the bottom most as well. I is not placed on the bottommost. So these are the chances are not for I and M. So only chance that I can fix I here. Let's fix I here 1 2 3 and this must be M. One chance or else I can fix M here 1 2 3 and this can be I. So these are the chances still we have another chance that I can fix I year and M year. So these are the possible chances where I can fix I and M. Right? Okay. So next point, similarly I can fix M and I also. Okay. So next point is I does not place on a modem. Okay. Two boxes are placed between R and S. So between R and S there should be a gap of two boxes. Right? Okay. So next point Q placed neither on the bottom nor on the fourth place. So Q is not placed on the bottom. So this is the place is not for Q as well. Fourth place we can't able to fix Q. So these are the places are not for Q. Right? And then box M is not placed on the topmost. See they have given one clue that box M is not placed on the topmost. We have drawn two possible here. We have M at the top. So definitely this is the place for I and this will be the place for M. Right? So these are the only two possible diagram that I have here. And now I think we have read the complete question. Let's now try to fix all the clues here. And we know one clue that s above it should be m not immediately above somewhere above and s is an even number. See here in this possible diagram I can fix s here only one chance because if I fix s here then s will be at the even position. S should be at the odd position. So now if I fix in this diagram this is the only place for s no other way because the remaining places are an odd number. So between s and r there should be gap of two. So either I can fix R here in the possible diagram or else I can fix R here. I'm getting two possibles but here I have only two chances I can fix R here only one chance right s and R we have a gap of two and then what are all the remaining points they have mentioned is R and S okay I think uh let's do one thing we have still some more letters remaining so well just listen here I should fix P right we know that P is not at the bottom right so P is not fixed here so two places that I can fix P either I can fix P here or P here let's move on to this point we know that P should not be placed here P should not be placed here P should not be placed here P should not be placed here so all these places a any one of the place I should fix P but all the places are there which the P should not be placed P should not be placed at the bottom P should not be placed at the top most so here so no places for P so completely this possible diagram is wrong so now let Let me move on to this possible diagram. So here we know that Q is not placed on the fourth floor. Q not fourth floor, fourth number, right? And also Q is not placed at the bottom. So this is not the place for Q and this is not the place for Q. Only one chance that I have Q here. This will be the only place. Now let me move on to fix the P. P is not placed at the bottom. So only one chance that I have a place here. I think yes. The remaining only one letter that I have here is P Q L. So I should fix L here. That's it. So this will be the answer. IQ RP M SL. So this will be the answer for this arrangement question. See very interesting right? Very very interesting. And this is also here also I have fixed the clue only based upon this minimum possible M and I. So if I go with M and I I will get a minimum possible. Or else if you go with S and M for example you can fix S here or else you can fix S here or else you can fix S here because S is on the even number. So 1 2 7 we have only three even number 2 4 and six and that two they have given a clue that above S we have M and between M and I we have a gap of three. So what you can do is you can fix S here. So M should be somewhere above this point between M and I. So if you think that will be the direct clue yes you can. But always prefer the clue like most number of boxes between even in the floor circle mostly between there will be more number of cases between I and M there is a gap of three boxes because the total is seven there itself we covered five. So that gives you the minimum possible. So go like that solve like that solve more number of questions you will automatically you know which letter to be fixed first. So go with it. Don't go maximum of just fix three possible is okay not more than that. If you are getting four or five possible it's completely time waste. Find a direct loop fix on the arrangement. You will surely get the answer within 3 minutes and you can solve the question. Right? So this will be the answer for this box set. So here is the next box arrangement. So totally there are six boxes P2 U or placed in a stack one above the other and each box contain a different number of pencils also 2,500 pencil 2,00 pencils etc. Right? So we have to find which box contains how many pencils and what is the position of the box. So totally there are six boxes. So five 4 3 2 and 1. So now let's start reading the clues and we can fix in the arrangement. Right. So first one so box P is placed immediately above box R immediately above box R is box P right okay so only one chance but we can't able to fix it in a diagram because we will get a multiple options so let's fix immediately above box R it should be box P next point three boxes are placed between R and the box which contain 2500 pencils so between R and 200 pencil three boxes So R 1 2 and 3 this must be 2,500 pencils one possible or else R and P. So 1 2 and three and this must be 2,500 pencils. So between in both the diagram between R and 2,500 pencil box we have three boxes. So when just just look at the clue here we already know that totally there are only six boxes here. If you count 1 2 3 4 5 6 already six got filled. So we can directly fix here. So P R so 1 2 3 gap and this will be 2,500. So directly I have fixed one possible because totally we have six boxes and all the six has been fixed here. So we can directly fix on the glue. But here this diagram 1 2 3 4 5. Okay not fixed. Let me move on to the next point. So box which contain,750 pencil is just above 2,500 pencil just about 2,500 is,750. So we have fixed here. Here also I think I can fix,750 because above 2500 you can directly see totally we got six places 1 2 3 4 5 6. So now we can fix this possible directly here. So 1 750. So 2500 and we can have a gap of two and then P and this will be R. So finally the second possible diagram also we have fixed. So only getting two possible now we can read the remaining line and we can fix it in the clue. Next point box which have,500. Okay. Next point is one box is placed between T and the box which has 1750. So 1750 and the box t we have a gap of one. So only one chance that this must be T and here this must be T. Only then we can say between T and,750 we have a gap of 1. So next point is U contains 2,00 pencils. So U contain 2,00 pencils. So I think I can't able to fix U. This is the only place for you 2,00 pencil. So similarly this is the only place for you which is 2,00 pencils no other way. Right? Next point the box which contain,90 pencil is placed below you. So below you we have a box which contain,90. So below you there are only two chances. Already number of boxes number of pencil boxes is fixed. We can't able to fix 1 9 0. So this possible diagram is completely wrong. No other way. But when we move on to this possible there are two chances 11 1 190 can be placed here or else 11 1 190 can be placed here. There are two chances we have because they they didn't mention immediately below below you. So there are two chances right. Next point three boxes are placed between yes and 1 9 0. So 1 9 0 pencil and yes there should be gap of three. So if I fix 1 1 9 0 here 1 2 3 this must be yes. If I fix 1 1 9 0 here 1 2 3 this must be S. So again for S also we have two possible. If I fix 1 1 9 0 this must be S. If I fix 1 1 9 0 this must be S. Again we are getting two possibilities. Still one more point is remaining. One box is placed between Q and the box which has,900 pencil. So 1,900 pencil and the box Q we have a gap of 1. So I can't able to fix,900 here. It's not possible. If I fix, 900, we can't able to fix Q. So if I place 1,900 box here, this is the only chance I can fix Q here. If I fix Q here, then this must be S. If I fix S here, 1 2 3 and this must be 1 1 9 0. No other way. So this must be 1 1 9 0 because we already know that between S and R that is 1 1 9 0 we have a gap of three boxes. So three boxes are placed between S and 1 9 0. So finally I fixed I think only one number of box which is remaining that is 175 28 0. So 28 0 0. So this is the box which contain 28 0. So finally the total arrangement itself we got fixed. Right? very easy. So what I did is I have just read the question and I tried to fix the clues here. But while fixing the clue itself I got a total number of six points. Right here you can able to see the total number of six count is already fixed. So what I did I directly fixed in the first possible second also I directly fixed because already we got all the six places. So now after fixing both the clues I tried to figure out the remaining points. Right? So remaining point we have eliminated below u we have 11 1 190 but below u we can't able to place any other thing. So this is the only possible diagram and then they have given one clue that between q and 1 9 0 we have a gap of one. So by using the clue we fix this and then s and this has been fixed and the remaining only one box which has 2800 pencil will be p. So this will be the answer for this box arrangement question. Very interesting. But if you keep on practicing, you you just see when while solving the first question, you might feel difficult. But when once you come to this number, you will automatically get some clues and you can try to find out the answer fastly. Right? Still more number of questions are there. Let's see. So that you can automatically get an idea how to solve if it is a box arrangement. Right? So still some more questions are there. Let me move on to the next sets. So here is the next box arrangement. So nine boxes P2X are placed one above the other not necessarily in the same order only five boxes are placed between P and R. So directly they have started the giving clues in the question. So they they just mentioned that totally there are nine boxes. So 9 8 always this will be the best way to so that we won't make a mistake right that's the reason I'm saying it's your wish but always make sure to if you're a beginner make sure to write down all the numbers so that we won't make any mistake on the exams right okay so now first point only five boxes are placed between P and R so between P and R there is a five boxes 1 2 3 4 5 so here it can be R or else we have another possible. So R 1 2 3 4 5. So totally in both the cases between P and R we have a gap of five. Second point T is immediately placed above R. Above R immediately it should be T. So this is the only chance immediately T. So this must be the only chance right. So totally in both the possible above R we fixed T. So when just listen here we know that totally there are nine boxes. I think here itself we have covered eight. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8. So already eight boxes is fixed. If only one box I fixed, I will directly fix in the clue because totally the number of boxes are non here in the possible two itself we got eight. Here 1 2 3 4 5 6 7. Okay. Okay. Let me move on to the next point. Sorry. Only three boxes are placed between T and S. So friends T and S there is only three boxes. You can't able to fix S at the top because it will be ruled out of the total number. So T and S there should be gap of three. So 1 2 and three. So this must be S. So similarly T and S 1 2 and 3 again it will rule ruled out of the arrangement. So 1 2 3 this must be S. In both the cases where between T and S there is a gap of three boxes. So next point as many boxes placed between P and S as between Q and T. So I have I have told this important logic in the first question itself. As many boxes that means uh the total box should be equal. So where you can see P and S. So the total box between P and S is equals to Q and T. If there are two boxes between P and S, Q and T should also have two boxes. That is the meaning of it. So here let's take the first possible case between P and S there is no box right there is no box. So between Q and T also there should not be any other box. So I should fix Q only here. So only then we can say between P and S there is no box. Between Q and T there should not be any box. So similarly let move on to the second possible case. So between P and S there are two boxes. So now between Q and T there should be two boxes right. So here already I have fixed one and two this must be Q. So here in the second possible diagram between P and S there is a gap of two box. So between Q and T also there should be gap of two box. Right? Two box. Similarly we have wrote the condition in both the possible diagrams. Right? So next point U is placed below Q but not at the bottom. So U is not at the bottom. They have mentioned it. And then they have mentioned a point below Q only we have U. So below Q we have U. But this U is not at the bottom. Right? We already fixed Q. Q here. If U is not at the bottom in this case U should not be fixed here. Only chance that I should fix U because no other way because U is not at the bottom. And totally there are only nine boxes. So 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9. So totally I fixed non and if I I should not place U here. Only chance that I should fix U here. And now coming to this condition we have multiple chances I can fix U U U U U U U U U U U U U U U U U U U U U because not immediately below Q it should below Q right. So there are so many options are here but 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 only one chance. Okay, let it be. Let me move on to the next remaining some more points are there. More than four boxes are placed between T and U. So between T and U there must be four plus boxes. More than four. It should not be four or it should not be three. It should be more than four. So between T and U there should be gap of four plus boxes. So when just see here we have already fixed T. So now our target is to fix U. Right? Already we have fixed U here. But between T and U we have only one box. But now according to the question what they are saying is between t and u there should be gap of four plus box right. So here this condition will be true already we have fixed t and u should be somewhere at this point but not at the bottom. So only two chances. So t 1 2 3 4. If I fix u here then between t and u there will be only four box. But the condition is four plus box. So definitely I should fix u here because u should not be at the bottom. Right? So only chance that I can fix U here. Next point, one box is placed between U and V. So between U and V, there must be a gap of one box. I should fix V here. So now I think we can directly fix T R. So space Q S space U P and V. So still two places remaining. And the last point box X is placed above W. So above W. It should be x not immediately it's above w that's it right. So finally we fixed the all the box position right. So t rx qs w u pv. So this will be the answer for this arrangement question. Very interesting. So we fix this arrangement and initially we got a major clue that between r and p we have a gap of five. Here itself we get a minimum possible and then by fixing the remaining stuff we got a clues right and we eliminated one possible case only because of this R and U. So between R and T and U between T and U there should be gap of more than four more than four means four plus not four or not three it should be 5 6 7. So only we have fixed U here and then we fixed all the remaining stuff right. So this will be the answer for this arrangement questions. Next arrangement question. So seven boxes M to S are arranged one above the other. Only two boxes are placed above P. I think directly they have started giving the clues. So totally there are seven boxes. So let's write down the numbers 7 6 and most students in the exam right I've seen many students usually by seeing these kind of arrangement question in the exam students will be happy why because they think that only seven boxes so the arrangement will be easy so only five boxes the question itself starts like this five boxes are arranged so by seeing that students decide that okay five boxes it will be simple arrangement kindly don't think like that even if it is four boxes or five boxes only two or three lines will be there in the question but solving will take more time. The question starts like totally there are 12 boxes. So we think that 12 boxes oh my god it's difficult to solve it. No if it is 12 boxes question will be easy most probably. So one our practice is important not the question size or question length that is not at all an important. So remember that the question can be either four box, five box or even 20 box. That is not a problem. Only our practice is more important. Right? So don't decide by seeing a question size. Do not decide it's easy or difficult. Right? So now let me move on to the first point. Only one box is two only two boxes are placed above P. So above P we have exactly two boxes. Then this is the only place where we can fix P. Only then we can say above P there is a gap of two box. Right? Only two box. Okay. So next only one box is placed between S and P. So between S and P there is a gap of one box. So already we have fixed P here either I can fix S or else S at the bottom. So we can go with another possible diagram. In both the cases between S and P we have a gap of one box. So second as many boxes again we have found that word as many boxes. As many boxes means the difference will be equal. So as many boxes between S and Q. So S and Q, Q and M will be equal number of boxes in between them. Right? So between S and Q, if there are two boxes, then Q and M, it should also have two boxes. That is the meaning of it. As many boxes between S and Q is equals to Q and M. So now we already fixed S here. So now our target to fix Q. Again, we have many options, right? So I think uh we should not fix and see in this diagram. Let's let's read the remaining part of the question. So three boxes are placed between N and O. N is placed above O. So there are three boxes between N and O and N is placed above O. Right? So let's fix this. If I fix N here 1 2 3 where O is not we can't able to fix O. only possible that I should fix N here 1 2 3 and this must be O. So similarly in this possible diagram I should fix N and O here no other possible way. So now what we can do is we have only limited number of spaces. So we can fix S and Q. So we already fix S here. I think uh if I fix Q here example I'm saying if I fix Q here between S and Q there is a gap of three. So between again between Q and M there should be gap of three. I can't able to place M here. If I fix Q here between S and Q there is a gap of two. So between Q and M also there is a gap of two. Yes I can fix here and I can fix the remaining letter R. I think we got the answer right. See between S and Q there is a gap of two box. Between Q and M there is a gap of two box which is equal. So again we have another possible. If I fix Q here between S and Q1 between Q and M it should also have one right so I can't able to fix M if I fix Q here between S and Q3 box between Q and M also it should have three box no way we can't able to fix in the second possible diagram as Q and M there is no chance of fixing Q and M so only this is correct this diagram will be correct so S NP QR OM so this will be the answer for this arrangement question no other way we can't able to go with any other possibles right see the question is very simple only three lines we have but the problem is we have to think more right where to fix and what are all the possible cases so always remember that that's what I'm repeatedly usually in 2017 18 itself on those video itself I have told you many students what they think that in the exams if the question length is very small they think it's a easy arrangement then they pick up the first thing they pick up that question the first thing and then they start writing the exams don't do it right so only by practicing you can able to find out of three or four arrangement in your competitive exams if you are preparing for bank I'm saying you you will get three or four arrangement in the exams for 20 marks so by just looking at the uh lines and length don't decide it's difficult or hard right if if the question has 10 or 20 lines solving will be very easy. If it has only three to four lines, you think it is easy but while solving you will have a multiple possibilities, right? So, okay, let's practice more number of questions. You will automatically understand it. So, friends, now this will be the answer for this arrangement box arrangement question. Next question. So, there are 11 boxes A to K are kept one above the other not necessarily in the same order. So, box G is kept at the fifth position from the top. So they have directly start giving the clues and totally how many boxes are there? So totally there are 11 boxes. So 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 and 1. Right? So now what they are saying is one box is kept at the fifth position from the top. That means it is on the fifth place from the top. Right? So what is the box they have mentioned is box G. So box G is kept at the fifth position from the top. So 1 2 3 4 5. So it will be placed on the seventh area. Right? So seventh place. So it is box G is placed only. Then we can say from the top it is on the fifth position. And what is the next point is two box are kept between G and H. So between G and H there is a gap of two boxes. So either I can fix H here one possible case or else I can fix one and two H here. So totally in the two possible cases where between G and H we have a gap of two boxes. Right? So next point is box D is kept just above box H. Just above means immediately above. So immediately above box H it is box D. So I can fix D here. So similarly I can fix D here. So next point is there are as many boxes. See again we found this word as many. As many means something is equal. They are comparing two condition which should be equal right. So now what they are saying is there are as many boxes above D right above D. So which is equal to right as below box B. So above B the number of boxes that will be equal to below B. For example if above D we have three boxes then below B it should also have three boxes. That is the meaning of it. So here in this first possible case above D we don't have any box. So below B also there should not be have any box. Then only possible chance I should fix B at the bottom. Only then we can say above B no box. Below B no box. Right? In the second possible case we already fixed D. Above D 1 2 3 4 5 6. Totally we have six boxes. Below B also it should have totally six boxes. Right? So 1 2 3 4 5 6. I think this is the only place if I fix B below B there will be six boxes and above D there there will be another six boxes but here already G is fixed so this possible diagram is completely wrong why because I can't able to fix B so now we are getting only one possible case here still more points are remaining so next point is five boxes are kept between F and K so Between f and k there are five boxes which is kept one of the position below g which means they are uh k right they representing that k so k will be below g so somewhere below g is k between k and f there is a gap of five box okay so what I can do is if example let's go with possible if I fix k here 1 2 3 4 5 this must be f or else if I place k here 1 2 3 4 5 this must be F. There are two chances either F should be placed here or F should be placed here. Only two chances between F and K there is a possible of five boxes between them and K should be placed somewhere below G. Right? So these are the two cases. So still some more points are left. Box A is kept one of the position above F. So above F one of the position box A is kept not immediately. It can be immediately or it can be above F. Above F it should be A. If I fix F here, we can't able to fix A. So only chance that I should fix F here and this must be A. And between F and K, there should be a gap of five. 1 2 3 4 5 and this must be K. Right? So finally I think most of the things are fixed. Still some more points are remaining. Only one box is kept between G and C. So definitely I should fix C here. Last point, box I is kept above box E but not just above. That means box E immediately it's not I right but it should be above E. So I think if I fix E here definitely it should not be I not immediately right? So if I fix E here this can be I so if I fix E here this can be I. So only chance for I is at sixth position right? But E can be either placed here or either placed here. But the last point what they are mentioning here is box E is not kept immediately above or below C. So box E is not immediately above or below. Then if it is not the place for E then this will be the only place for E and still one more letter is remaining A B C D E J is remaining. So J should be placed here. That's it. See the question starts with 11 boxes. So we thought usually our students what they think is it's difficult but not difficult right? So we have directly fixed by using the most of the clue has been directly given but when you take two question back or one question back only five boxes are there but we have to think and solve it. So that's what I said right don't by just seeing the length of the question do not decide it's difficult. So keep on practice more number of question you will automatically get the clue right. So we found this major clue by using the one as many boxes between D and B by only that clue we have eliminated the one possible and then by using F and A F above A. So we by using that we fixed F and K because between F and K there should be gap of five boxes. Then we automatically solved the remaining part of the question. Right? So this will be the answer for this box puzzle. Next question. So eight boxes A to H are placed one above the other on a particular order and the box one is at the bottom. So totally they have mentioned there are eight boxes. So box number one is at the bottom. Right? So 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 and 8. So totally there are eight boxes. So bottom is number one and the topmost will be eight. So now the first point three boxes are placed between A and B. So between A and B there is a gap of three boxes. So 1 2 3. So this will be B. Or else we will have another possible I can fix B here. This will be A. So totally we are getting two chances two possible between B and A there is a gap of three boxes. So next point box H is placed immediately below A. Immediately below A it should be H. So this will be the place for H and this will be the place for H. In both the possible cases below H immediately below A it should be H. So there are two boxes between H and G. So between H and G there is a gap of two boxes. I think already here we have B. So we can't able to fix G here. So one and two and this must be G. So between H and G we have a gap of two box. And similarly if I put one and two G here totally we should have eight boxes. If I put G here by just substituting two gaps then it will be nine box. So it is not possible. So I think this is the only possible way. So between G and H in both the possible cases there are two boxes. So now there are as many boxes again as many is something equal two condition is getting equal. So there are as many boxes between C and D. So C and D right which is equal to H and B. So the this is what they are saying between C and D if we have three boxes then between H and B also we should have three boxes. But here H and B there are two box C and D should also have two box. So C D C more possibles. So H and B we have 1 2 3 4. So now C and D we should have four D again we are getting multiple possibles. So we don't want to fix it. Now let me see all the remaining points. So box C is kept above D. So above D it should be box C. Right? So above D it should be box C. Not immediately above but above D it should be box C. Okay. So box E is kept immediately below D. So below D we have a box E. So immediately below D we have E. Just just here uh in case if I fix D and if I fix E here then totally we should have eight boxes. So 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 already seven fixed. So definitely D and E is not possible. So only chance that I should fix D here. I should fix E here. is because below D it should be E. So below D it should be only one chance. Now getting onto this possible diagram 1 2 3 4 5 6 and D and E definitely I should fix E here. Why? Because if I fix D and E we already know that above D only we have C. So if I fix D and E here above D we can't able to fix because totally we have only eight boxes. So only chance I should fix D and E here. So now getting to this clue between H and B how many boxes are there? Two boxes right? Then between C and D also we should have two box. So D is fixed. So I should fix C definitely here. So only then between C and D two box between H and B two box condition satisfies. So now between C and D we should have H and B how many box are there? 1 2 3 4 H and B four box. So D and C 1 2 3 4 then this must be C. So in both the cases we have satisfied that condition. So C and D H and B equal number of boxes. So 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 already fixed only one letter is remaining which is F. This is the place for F right. So still one more point is there. The last point three boxes are between E and F. Between E and F there is a gap of three boxes. So between E and F we have three boxes. But here between E and F. So 1 2 3 and I should place F here. Only then we can say between E and F there will be gap of three boxes. In case if I fix F here just count how many box are there total? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10. It's wrong actually. So this possible diagram is completely wrong. Why? because we have only total eight boxes and if we fix E we can't able to fix F at the top that is also there is no place only bottom I have to fix if I fix at the bottom then totally we are getting 10 boxes so completely wrong the second possible diagram is correct so B C G F A H D and E so this will be the answer for this arrangement box arrangement question right so very interesting So totally friends in this video we have solved many box arrangements right. So what you guys have to do is after a week what I mentioned in the first initial stage of the video right I have given 10 practice set total 50 question only on the box arrangement right 30 minutes each arrangement for 3 minutes write the test do not write the test immediately now or tomorrow just take your time like 5 to 6 days a week only then you can understand that so what are all the mistakes you are doing right if you write the test immed Immediately you know all the logic you will just get 10 50 out of 50 but after a week if you write the test you will understand that what are all the mistakes that you are doing. So take your time in your exam speed is important. You have to crack the arrangement question within 2 to 3 minutes. So if you need to crack within 2 to 3 minutes on your exam you have to practice now. So take your time practice more. I I try to post the remaining logic like calendar based puzzle, day based puzzle and month based puzzle. There are many categories of puzzles are there. Definitely I will post it right. So friends, thank you so much for watching this video. If you really like it, share the video to your friends, those who are preparing for the competitive exams and make sure to practice with your friends, right? By just have a group discussion like uh group study in your home which makes you to learn faster. If you practice eating arrangement with your friends right then each one will different think differently so that you can learn more. So always practice with your friends like seating arrangements and some miscellaneous topics in quantitative aptitude. Sit and prepare with your friends. Have a group study where you can learn fastly and you can learn more logics. Right? So friends thank you so much. Okay. So thank you so much for watching this video and see you on the next video. Bye.",unknown
WaiOgtmbuac,"First of all, thanks for being here in my YouTube channel. So friends, if you are a regular follower of my channel. So do not forget to purchase my book quantitative aptitude book and start solving all the question what I have given in this book. Right? Because each and every question it's an art level question. Nowadays our competitive exam level or keep on increasing. So practice all the questions what I have given inside this book. If you have any doubt on purchasing it, do not forget to watch this video. In the unboxing video, I've told you what all the topics are there and where to buy this book, everything. So, if you are a regular follower of feel free to learn, do not forget to purchase this book on our platform. So, now let me move on to the video. So friends, now let me move on to lesson number two that is on the topic rhombus. So here in this video we will be solving some of the questions that is based on the rhombus for your competitive exam. So before watching this video don't forget to watch the previous video which is lesson number one introduction about rhombus because you should know the basics of rhombus like what is called as rhombus and what is the difference between rhombus and a square. So if you take a rhombus where the interior angle will be 360° when you take a square where all the vertices corner angle will be 90°. So you should always remember that the important properties of a rhombus before solving a question. And there we learned some of the formulas in a rhombus in lesson number one. So where you should apply the first formula that is I think square root of d1x2 the whole square plus d2x2 the whole square is equal to a or else we can use the same formula as simplified manner. A is equals to 1x2 square root of d1 square + d2 square. So where you should apply the formula one and where you should apply the formula two you have to understand that what I've told in the previous video and finding the area of a rhombus will be half of the two diagonal d1 into d2. Right? So those are the properties what is called as angle bis sector interior angle two opposite angles will be equal. So all those stuff we have learned in the first lesson itself. So now entering into this lesson number two we will be solving some of the questions here that is based on a rhombus. So here is the first question. A b c d is a rhombus and each side is 8 cm. If bd is equal to 10 cm, a c is equals to 2 square roo of x, then find the value of roo of x + 10. So here our target is to find what is the value of square root of x + 10. So I think we need to find the value of x by using the given data that is on the rhombus. Right? So always if you are a beginner try to draw a diagram first and then write down all the values what they have given in the question. So this is the rhombus, right? So we know that a rhombus have two diagonals and the opposite angles will be same. And then here they have mentioned that the rhombus all the sides are 8 cm. So the sides will be equal to 8 cm. And then what are all the remaining values they have mentioned it's a rhombuses a b c and d. Now what they have mentioned is the that the length of b and d. So B and D where the length is equals to 10 cm and we know that if we draw a two diagonal then the angle will bisect that means the length of this diagonal will be split into two equal off. So we can say that if BD is equal to 10 cm. So this value will be five and this value will be five. So similarly the another diagonal A and C the value will be 2 roo of X. So if we divide 2 roo of x by 2 then resultant will be this will be square root of x and this line length will be square root of x. So first time if you are preparing for it write like this and then solve a question. After solving 10 or 15 question don't do it. It's it's time waste. So just initially do this and then when you practice and automatically you don't want to write all those diagrams here. You just apply the formula and you can solve the question. So now what is our target? Our target is initially to find what is the value of X. So in the previous video itself I have told you right if we draw a rhombus the internal angles will be 360° total. When you take one angle which will be equal to 90° that means 90° 90° 90° 90°. So here you can easily find out there are four right angle triangle because if one angle is 90° then it's a right angle triangle. So when we combine four right angle triangle resultant will be rhombus. So let's take any one right angle triangle outside. So let's take this right angle triangle. So when you take this right angle triangle alone this part alone we know that this length will be 5 cm and this length will be 8 cm and this length will be x cm. Yes or no? Because we know that one angle will be 90°. So now apply the pythagoras theorem. What is the pythogorus theorem? C square is equal to A square + B square. So C square will be 8 square which is 64 is equals to A square B square. So A square will be 25. So B square will be X. So X is equals to 39. So finally by applying the Pythagoras theorem in any one of the triangle because all the four triangles are same because all the sides are same. If we draw a diagonal bisect the length will be same. So everything will be same. So better we can find take any one right angle triangle and we can find what is the value of x. So finally we found the value of x= to 39. But this is not the final answer because our target is to find what is the answer for x + 10. So we got x= to 39. So 39 + 10 will be square root of 49 resultant will be 7 cm. So finally answer for this first question where the value of given expression is 7 cm right. So rhombus is very easy don't think that rhombus is difficult it is very easy just you have to understand the formulas and important properties of a rhombus and then solving it will be very very simple. So initially while practicing some question draw a diagram and then if you are preparing for any important competitive exams don't waste your time by drawing a diagram directly understand the question and try to apply it in a formula right so answer for the first question is 7 cm. Second question so the length of each side of the rhombus is 13 cm and length of the one diagonal is 24 cm. Find the area of the rhombus. So here in this question our target is to find what is the area of the rhombus. Right? So we already learned the formula in the lesson number one itself. So the area of the rhombus will be half of diagonal one into diagonal 2. Yes, this is the formula to find the area of a rhombus. And we already know that the diagonal one value because diagonal one is directly given in the question which is 24 cm. So now our target is to find what is the diagonal 2 value. So once you find the diagonal two then substituting here resultant will be the area of the rhombus right. So for finding diagonal 2 either you can use the formula what I told in the previous video or else you can go with the pythagoras theorem. So formula is like previous video I mentioned it a is equal to 1x2 square roo of d1 square d2 square yes you can if you wish you can by using that formula you can find what is diagonal 2 value and then you can substitute it or else better you can go with the simple pythagoras theorem right so first draw the rhombus and we know all the value right because we know the each side is how much 13 cm so this will be 13 cm and this total length of one diagonal which is 24 cm. So this will be 12 and this will be another 12. But we don't know what is the another diagonal length. So let's assume this as X and this will be X. Total length will be 2X. Right? So now by using by we already know that this the center angle will be 360°. All the four triangles will be a right angle triangle. So let's take this right angle triangle alone. So once you take this right angle triangle apply the Pythagoras theorem. So slope square. So slope squared will be 13 squared is equals to a square and b square. So which will be 12 square and x². So 13 squared will be 169. 12 square will be 144 is equ= to x². So x² is equ= to 25. x= 5. That means the diagonal is not five. Right? We have found only half of the diagonal which is the value of x that is 5. So the total length of the diagonal will be five and five is 10. So students usually in the exams right then by just solving it in a speed they wrongly mention D2 as five. Remember that always in the rhombus once you find the diagonal value that diagonal value which we usually find will be half of the diagonal. Right? So here the total length of the diagonal will be two *s of x to 2 * of x will be 10. So now the diagonal 2 will be 10. diagonal one already they have given in the question which is 24. So 1 by 2 into diagonal 1 into diagonal 2 resultant will be the area of the rhombus. So we can cancel this 12 times which is 120. So finally we can say that the area of the rhombus will be 120. So this is one of the way to solve the question in case if you want to find without applying the pythogoras theorem. If you want to find the next diagonal value, another diagonal value by using a formula. Yes, you can. In order to find this d2, we can use this formula also. A is equals to 1x2 roo of d1 squar + d2 squared. So a will be side which is 13. So 13 into 2 is equals to square root of d1 diagonal 1 what they have already mentioned here 21 the whole square plus d2 square. Yes, you can you can just take a square root of uh multiply 13 13 into 26. So 26 square minus 24 squared and you will get what is the value of D2 and then substitute here to find the area of the rhombus. So two different way you can find the diagonal value either by applying the Pythagoras theorem or by applying in the formula. It's you have wish when you keep on practicing more number of question you will automatically decide that which method is easy. So this is the way we find the area of the rhombus. Right? And this is the answer for question number two. Third question. So one of the diagonal of a rhombus is 8 3 and the other diagonal is equal to the side. Find the area of the rhombus. So here in this question similarly like a previous question our target is to find what is the area. So area of a rhombus we already know that half into d1 into d2. So this is the formula we usually find to find the area of the rhombus and here according to the question one diagonal value which is already given 8 3. So let's assume d1 as 8 3. So now our target is to find what is the value of d2. So initially draw a diagram right. So rhombus. So rhombus we know that we are having a two diagonals and here the side is also not given and one length of the rhombus is also not given. They have given only one length one diagonal length which is equals to 83. So we can assume this as 43 and remaining this length as 43 and they have mentioned one point here that is the other diagonal which is equal to the side that means this diagonal length is equals to the side length. So what we can do is let's let's assume this as a. I'm just assuming the one side of the rhombus length is a then we can say the total another diagonal length will be a because this another diagonal length which is equal to the side. So if this is a then this total length will also be a. So half of the diagonal will be a by 2 and a2. So finally we fixed all the diagonal length. So one diagonal length will be 83 total. So half will be 4 3. Another diagonal length which is equal to the side. So side is a. The total diagonal length will also be a but half of the diagonal will be a by2. So now it is easy to find what is the a value. Why? Because we know that it's 90°. So we can apply the pythagoras theorem here. So pythogoras theorem will be slope that is a² is equals to b² + c². So b² will be 4 3 the all square plus c² will be a by 2 the all square. So this will be a² minus of a² divided by 4 is equals to 4² will be 16 3 roo of 3 square will be 3. So 16 into 3 resultant will be 48. So now 4 into a will be 4 a² minus of a² is equ= to 48 into 4. So now I'm just taking LCM here. So 4 a² into 48 into 4. So 4 a² minus of a² will be 3 a² will be 48 into 4. So we can cancel it resultant will be 16. So a² is equals to 16 into 4. So a will be 4 into 2 which will be 8. So finally we can say that the value of a will be 8. This is not the diagonal value. Just we found the side one side which is 8. And we already know that side will be equal to the diagonal length. So if side is 8 the diagonal length will also be 8. Or else you can just substitute a is equals to a value here a by two that is four. So four and four the total diagonal length will be 8. Either way right. So they have already mentioned in the question the side length which is equal to another diagonal length. So side length which is 8. So another diagonal length will also be 8. So substitute here the second diagonal value which is 8 into 1 by 2. So we can cancel 1 2's are 2 4 2's are 8 8 into 4 will be 32. So 32 3. So finally we can say that the area of the rhombus will be 32 3. So which will be the answer for question number three. Right? So I hope you understood how we are finding the diagonals and how we are applying it a formula right even the question is difficult the logic will be same just we need to find in order to find the area perimeter is easy perimeter is 4 a and similarly finding the area of area is also easy half of d1 into d2 just we need to find what is the diagonal and we need to apply here right that's it so this will be the answer for this question so here is the fourth question so a b c d is the rhombus and the triangle angle will be ABC which is 52° then what is the angle of AC so here our target is not to find the area or not to find the diagonal length here our target is to find what is the angle of one of the triangle angle right so if it is a rhombus you guys know that what are all the properties of an angle so opposites angles will be equal and the diagonal which makes the angle into two equal of angle bis sector Right. So now here they have given only one angle that is angle of ABC is equals to 52°. So first let we draw a a rhombus here. So let's consider this as a rhombus. Anyway it does not looks like a rhombus. So just assume it's a rhombus right? All the four sides will be equal. And let's assume this as a b c and d. So now according to the question what they are saying is the angle of abc. So the angle of A B C which is equals to 52° that means when you take this triangle right angle of A B C so this total triangle angle this angle will be 52° yes or no according to the question what they have mentioned is if we roam if we draw a rhombus right without diagonal so this angle will be 52° this is the thing what they have mentioned in the question so when you consider this as ABC as a triangle so angle of B will be 52° And in the property we have learned that if it is a rhombus if we draw a line diagonal and we already know that opposite angles will be equal. If this angle is 52° then this angle will be 52° and if we draw a diagonal line so this makes the angle into two equal. That means if total angle is 52° because of drawing a diagonal here this makes this angle 26° and 26°. So similarly this total will be 52°. So now we draw a diagonal line which bisects the angle. So this will be 26° and this will be 26°. So now what is our target? Our target is to find what is the angle of A C D that means A C and D. Our target is to find only this angle not the total angle. Our target is to find A C D. That means this angle alone. How will you find it? It's very simple right? Why? Because we already know that if it's a rhombus, the interior angle will be 360°. That means each triangle is a right angle triangle and this will be 90°. So one angle is 90°, another angle is 26°. What about the third angle? Because we know that if it is a triangle, sum of three angles will be 180°. So 180° will always be the sum of three angles of a triangle. And one angle here is 90°. So another angle is 26°. When you add both the value, resultant will be 116°, right? 116° minus 180° resultant will be 64°. That means this angle will be 64°. So only then we can say that when you add all the three angles of a triangle which is equals to 180°. So now according to the question our target is to find what is the angle this angle alone. So this angle alone is 64°. In case if we need to find the total angle for example this total angle of C which will be 64° plus 64° will be 18°. If this angle is 18° the opposite angle this will also be not 80. That is the property of a rhombus right? Opposite angles are equal and that angle when you draw a diagonal the angle will be biseect that means into two equal that's it. So answer for this question is 64°. So this is the way we solve the question that is on a rhombus right. So friends here in this four question what we solved is to find a diagonal value one diagonal will be given finding another diagonal or else by giving the diagonal value our target is to find the area and in the last question one angle will be given by using that we have found the other angles. So these are the things that we learned in this video. Right? If you're preparing for uh competitive exams like SSC exam, railway exams or other state level competitive exam, don't give much importance to rhombus, trapezium like that. Give more and more importance while preparing for your exam for circle, rectangle, triangle, two circles, chord, tangent. Learn all those things. Right? Give little bit importance to these kind of question like rhombus trapezium give more importance to triangle circle square geometry based question because more number of question were asked on that area only limited number of question here and there you can able to find a question that is from quadrilateral or else from rhombus etc. So only I just thought you only the basics and how to apply the value in the formula to find area or to find the angle. So friends, thank you so much for watching this video and if you really like it, share it to your friends those who are preparing for the competitive exams. So thank you so much. See you on the next video. Bye.",unknown
7AT0z_NyQ90,"First of all, thanks for being here in my YouTube channel. So friends, if you are a regular follower of my channel. So do not forget to purchase my book quantitative aptitude book and start solving all the question what I have given in this book. Right? Because each and every question it's an art level question. Nowadays our competitive exam level or keep on increasing. So practice all the questions what I have given inside this book. If you have any doubt on purchasing it, do not forget to watch this video. In the unboxing video, I have told you what are all the topics are there and where to buy this book everything. So if you are a regular follower of feel free to learn, do not forget to purchase this book on our platform. So now let me move on to the video. So friends, now let me move on to lesson number one that is on the geometry topic questions that is based on rhombus. Right. So before learning a rhombus so first understand that inside a geometry we have many categories of question triangle circle parallelogram rhombus premit but you have to learn the geometry topic because geometry is the vast syllabus if you are preparing for railway s campus or your state level competitive exams always remember that first geometry you have to learn the triangle and then second geometry you have to learn the circles and then only you have to go with rhombus, parallelogram, premade etc. Why? Because if you take geometry 90%age of the concept will be on pythagoras theorem. So applying a pythagoras theorem to find some of the answers. So only first geometry you have to learn triangle. So in our YouTube channel I have posted 12 videos starting from lesson number one till all the different kinds of model on the topic triangle. So first learn geometry triangle and then come and learn geometry circle what is called as chord what is called as tangent how we apply the pythagoras theorem inside a circle to find the radius length of the chord or length of the tangent everything so learn that and then come and watch this rhombus video right because if you learn step-by-step process definitely you can feel the geometry topic will be very easy even though it's a vast syllabus for the competitive exams but if you learn it in a step-by-step process Definitely this topic will be easy. So friends, now in this video we are going to learn some of the important properties of a rhombus because a rhombus and a square looks exactly same but there will be some small difference here but we have to understand what is the difference between square and a rhombus and what are all the important properties are there for a rhombus and rhombus we have three formula. one is a area formula and second is the perimeter formula and the third is the diagonal based remaining finding the remaining values. So that formula alone if you search it in a Google they will use a different formula to solve each and every teacher will solve a different different formulas to find that diagonal one diagonal two value. So you learn only one formula and make small changes in that formula to apply to solve the question in a easy way. So I will teach you where to apply that formula and in which question if you apply the same formula in a different way you will get the answer easily. So you don't want to learn many formulas learn only one formula try to change that formula into a different different format and based upon the question you can apply that formula so that that will be easy and you can solve the question fastly right. So friends in this video we are going to completely learn the property of rhombus an important formula and in the next video we will be solving some of the important question that is based on a rhombus. So now let we move on to the basics property of a rhombus. Okay friends, now let we move on to the basic property of a rhombus. Right? So every time before learning a rhombus first understand what is the major difference between square and a rhombus because square and a rhombus when you look at most of the diagram it looks similar but understand that if it is a square right it's a square and this is a rhombus. So if it is a square all the sides are same. Yes the length all the side length will be equal. Similarly in rhombus also all the side length are equal. But the only difference between square and a rhombus is in a square we have all these angles 90° exactly 90° then only we can say it's a square. If the angles are at not at 90° then it is called as a rhombus. Right? If all the four angles are 90° then it is a square. If all the four angles are not 90° then it is a rhombus. That is the major difference because perimeter of a square is 4A. Rhombus of a perimeter of a rhombus is also a 4A because all the sides are equal. But the only difference is based on a angle. If all the four angles are 90° then it is called as a square. If all the four angles are not a 90° then it is called as a rhombus. Right? So now let me move on to the first let let's learn the difference between square and a rhombus. Right? So now we can learn some of the important properties here. The first property all the sides are equal. Just now I have told you right all the sides of the rhombus will be equal. Point number two opposite sides are parallel. For example we have four sides here. When you take a d one side this side will be parallel to cb. Similarly DC is one side and this side is parall to AB. So once understood or not? So all the side opposite sides are parallel. So this side and this side will be parallel and this side and this side will be parallel. So that is the point number two. Point number three opposite angles are equal. So very important property here right because if it is a rhombus right we have four angles. In this four angles always the opposite angles will be equal. For example, if you take this complete angle is 40°, then opposite angle of C will be A. So this angle total will be 40°. So similarly, if angle D is 60°, then angle B will also be 60°. So opposite angles. So these are called as opposite. So opposite angle in a rhombus will be equal. So that is the point number three. Point number four, diagonal bisects each other. So you know what is called as a diagonal, right? from this point if I draw a line to another vertices which is called as a diagonal. So here in a rhombus we can draw two diagonal. So let's assume that this is diagonal one and this will be diagonal two right. So here in a rhombus we have two diagonals but both the diagonal while drawing a diagonal lines you can see both the diagonal bisects each other that means it crosses each other right it overtakes or what what to say it it's overlaps right so which is called as a diagonal bisect each other so the bisect points will be at this point where the diagonal bisects each other so which is fourth point and the fifth point where the diagonals are perpendicular yes or no because we have drawn on one diagonal like this and one diagonal horizontally and vertically. So we can say that the diagonals are perpendicular. And the last point sum of the interior angle is 360° which is most important point. So sum of interior angle is 360°. So friends listen here. We know that in a rhombus we know opposite angles are equal. But there is an another angle inside the rhombus because we have the diagonal bisc point here. So just look at this carefully. So this point is called as a 90°. And similarly this angle will be another 90° and this angle will be another 90° and this angle will be another 90°. So each one of these part is a right angle triangle because if one angle is 90° then it is a right angle triangle. Right? So just listen carefully. So this angle is 90°. This angle is 90° and this is 90 and this is 90. When you add all these four angle 90° into 4 resultant will be 360°. That's the reason they are saying sum of interior angle is 360°. So friends understood or not? Most important point. Why? Because you have to remember one thing. If it is a rhombus, it's rhombus is made up of four right angle triangle. See this is one right angle triangle. This will be another right angle triangle and this will be another right angle triangle and this will be another right angle triangle. So if we join all these four right angle triangle then it comes as a rhombus. Right? So important point and if you add sum of all the four interior angle which is equals to 360° right. So there are some important properties are also there in a rhombus other than this. But while solving a question I will tell you how to apply that property there because without knowing a number you will feel confused if you will learn initially all those properties but remember that these are the important properties are for the rhombus. So first thing is all the sides are equal and second is the sides opposite sides are parallel and the diagonals are perpendicular. Sides are parallel, diagonals are perpendicular and then opposite angles are always equal. And then the most important point sum of the interior angle or internal angle that point diagonal point that diagonal bisect point this point where we can say that sum is equals to 360°. Right? So that's it. These are the important properties of a rhombus. So now let me move on to the three important formulas in the topic rhombus. So friends, now let me move on to the three important formulas that we have in the topic rhombus, right? Very simple formulas. So first will be the area of a rhombus. So for finding the area of the rhombus you have to multiply the two two diagonal values length and then divide by 2. So half of d1 into d2 that means diagonal 1 multiply two diagonal values d1 into d2 divided by two which will be the area of the rhombus. And next perimeter of the rhombus. We already know that for a square the length all the sides will be same. Rhombus also all the sides will be same. If you take one side as a then all the four sides will be a a a. So which we can write it as 4 a. So perimeter of a rhombus is 4 a. So coming to the third important formula side of a rhombus. In order to find the value of a this is the basic formula for a rhombus for finding the value of a. But you can simplify this formula and you can write the formula like this because d1 square we are separating these two value d1 squared d2 squared 2² is 4 2 is 4 taking outside four outside from the square root it becomes 1x2. So we have two formulas but listen carefully friends we can apply both the formula to find any one of the formula to find the sides of a rhombus. But listen carefully in case in your exam if the value of D1 is given and the value of D2 is given so our target is to find what is the value of A first case let's example I'm saying which formula to be used at the right point right so if the value of D1 is given value of D2 is given our target is to find what is the value of A in this case try to apply the first formula why because if the value of D1 is 24. Example I'm saying if the value of D1 is 24 if you go with the second case so half of D1 24 squared you have to find what is the value for 24 squared. So it is little bit difficult to find the answer for 24 squared because it takes time if you are preparing for SSE railway or other exams you have to little bit fast. So at that case what you can do is apply the value in this formula 24 by 2 which is 12 12 squared is 144 yes or no. So I've written 144 easily here but if I go with 24 squared here so 24 square another number which will be a lengthy process it takes little bit of time more when compared to this formula in case number one if both d value is given in in our target is to find what is the a value. If the question is like this, better go with the first formula. In case if one D value has been given but D2 value is not given, A value is given. In this case, do not go with the first formula. Go with the second formula. So apply D1 value, apply A value and find what is D2. Why? Because in this case we will not make any mistake because we will take a square root to the left hand side which will be easy. But if you come here if you apply D1 value and if you apply a value for finding a D2 there might be a chance of making a mistake while finding LCM. So that's the reason I'm saying if both the D value has been given go with the first formula. If one D1 or D2 or A value has been given go always with the second formula. So it's completely your wish. If you go with any one of the formula you're going to get the answer. But my suggestion is always going with this method. This will help you to save your time in the exam as well as the steps will be low and you won't make any mistake while taking LCM. So that's the reason I'm saying all these stuff right. So friends thank you so much for I think enough right just in a lesson one we have learned the introduction about rhombus and basics about rhombus from the next lesson we can start solving a question and there I can tell you some of the other important properties while solving it so that you can able to understand it easily. So friends, thank you so much for watching this video and do not forget to purchase the book on the platform of feel free to learn because those books are definitely help you to clear the competitive exam recent years. Why? Because uh nowadays the exam level are little bit high. So only if you practice the difficult question you can able to clear the exam. So do not forget to purchase the book on my channel. Right. So friends, thank you so much for watching this video. Bye.",unknown
e2Um5iEtuxw,"First of all, thanks for being here in my YouTube channel. So friends, I hope you have seen the notification of IBBSPO this year. It was like preped, right? The exam is on August 17th only 2 months to go, right? Exactly 2 months. So just increase your time on the preparation for this exam. If you are preparing only for IBSPO, right? So you have to remember some of the stuff. So first thing some basic topic don't learn all the topics on quantitative aptitude that that will not help you to clear the prelims exam. If you need to clear the first the prelims exam you have to target some of the topics like simplification equation case or set theory right nowadays case set theory were repeatedly asked in many competitive bank exams. So caselet set theory and then data interpretation and then some of the miscellaneous topics. So that miscellaneous topics you can choose problems on ages, time and work, time and distance. So learn only limited number of topic for the prelims exam and increase your speed to solve those questions right. So surely you can able to crack the prelims exam. And I have posted more number of videos on my channel. If you take equation, we have a playlist. If you want to learn time and work, we have a playlist. So I have covered all the topic from the basics till the medium level questions on my channel. It is enough. So for the mains exam again if you are preparing only for IBSPO tough level competitive exams do not forget to purchase my book right because this book I'm guaranteed that you can able to learn the concept of each and every topic clearly. So no doubt about it just sit and practice right if you already got this book I hope uh previous week alone we dispatched 5,000 copies and the northeast thank you so much to the students of Megaa Arnachal Pradesh Misoram Manipur northeast states of our country right so we have dispatched one full container post post office uh container right full container of books so only for the six states northeast states right Manipur, Mizoram, Arnachal Pradesh, Megallaya, Sikkim right we have dispatched the book so nearly 1,800 books I think so we have dispatched only for the northeast states so thank you so much all I hope you guys have received the book in case if you ordered earlier like uh uh June 1st or June 5th till now you didn't receive the book kindly call us because we have dispatched all the books and more students have received it. So again if you are preparing for the bank exams so do not forget to purchase the book and it's not for bank UPSC railway everything but just practice and see the level of the question and mainly if you're preparing for bank PO or blank clerk mains exam just keep on solve this question what I have given on this book right if you solve this questions like simple interest compound interest time and work from one to 100 question you will surely understand the level of the question So that from the basics if you need to crack the mains level data interpretation question definitely the mid-level targeted questions are more and more important right small twist in the question you need to understand how to solve it. So again friends do not forget to purchase the book. So the purchase link I have given in the description page or if you want to see the unbox of the book video you can see the unbox of the book video or in case I hope I have told everything on the unbox video. So uh do not forget to purchase the book on this week itself and students those who are buying the book this week the books will be dispatched from Friday. So you will definitely get the book by next weekend. So if you are from like Jammu Kashmir or Imatal Pradesh, Maharashtra uh Andra you will get within 3 days. So I think Gujarat, Rajasthan. So all these states you will get within a week. We will dispatch in a speed post through post office. So definitely you will get within a week. So uh do not forget to purchase the book and start practicing each and every question what I have given on the book. Surely surely you can able to crack the mains level question because you have learned the basics to crack the mains level DI you need to require some strong more basics right so that's what I've given in the book. So practice it and all the best for all the students those are preparing for the competitive exams this year IBBS PO or IBS clerk RBPO click whatever be practice it and work hard do not see the vacancy always I used to say is do not see the vacancy do not see the tough level do not see the competition just go right you just have a proper self-preparation work hard 6 to 8 hours a day don't overwork because if you if you like preparing ing 12 hours or 18 hours that will not help you to clear the exam. Just 6 hours or 8 hours but you need to concentrate more and you need to practice more. For the prelims, speed is important. For the mains, speed is not at all important. Concept is important, right? So keep that in mind and practice it. So friends, thank you so much for watching this video. I will definitely make sure to help in case if if you want to post any of the videos topic, I will definitely do that. So only suggestion for you guys those who are preparing for the IBBSPO do not forget to purchase the book so that we will dispatch by this week itself. So friends thank you so much and uh thank you so much all students those who purchased the book previous week nearly 5,000 copies we have sold within a week. It's not the easy thing to dispatch all the products. Uh because we we were like nearly 10 to 15 people are working here. Day and night they packed and they delivered to the post office and then we found 1,200 copies only to Meallaya only to Meallaya. So uh we we uh uh contacted the post office to have have it in a bulk order. So we packed 1,200 books in a single container and we uh packed to the Megallaya only to the northeast states of our country. So very happy by seeing more number of students preparing across our country by seeing my channel. So thank you so much all uh no words to express this but anyway thank you so much for all the support that you guys have given to us and uh my suggestion is practice all the question if you didn't purchase the book kindly 5.99 include the delivery charge itself also right so this 599 includes a delivery charge you don't want to pay any extra amount for the delivery charge so purchase it and start practicing the questions so friends thank you so much for watching this video. All the best for your preparation.",unknown
lRCP2CL3Rrk,"First of all, thanks for being here in my YouTube channel. And here is my first quantitative aptitude book. So, thank you, thank you, thanks a lot each and every subscriber of my channel from 2016 because 8 years 1.8 million subscribers is not at all an easy thing, right? As an education channel. So thanks for each and everyone those who supported me those who supported me from 2016 only because of you this is possible and in my life it's a greatest achievement right because writing a book first I have written all the things in a handwritten and then I have converted into a digital copy I will show you everything right so thank you so much because uh each and everyone those who are preparing for a competitive exam you have a different different book I have multiple quantitative aptitude books And if you are preparing for a quant any competitive exam, you too will have a multiple quantitative aptitude books. But I just want to give you an unique quantitative aptitude book. So that if you are preparing for an any competitive exam, you should clear it if you practice this question and you should know each and every concept of the topic. That is important. So what I did is I have taken each and every topic separately. I have started writing in a paper in a as a fully handwritten copy. See this is the probability topic fully I have written in an handwritten each and every question how to solve it and what are all the shortcuts are there and similarly problems on uh ages. So each and every topic I have taken and nook and corner what are all the important areas are the student what exactly they should learn because just like that if you start preparing no useful on it right so if you if you want to practice in a right way you have to learn it in a right way first only then you can have a proper practice so each and everything initially I have written in an handwritten copy and important stuff see usually I've highlighted it if it isn't anything is important here I hope you can able to see in a camera. So if anything is important here just I have highlighted each and every point and then after writing all the 35 topics on each and every because even now recent years arithmetic progression, geometric progression, search and indices most of the topics are important nowadays. So I have written each and every topic and then converted into my first quantitative aptitude book. So here is my first book. So I have total number of pages is five 33 pages and total number of topics that I have covered is 35 topics right. So most most important questions I have given for the current year competitive exam that is the most important thing. So once if you practice this you will feel what is the real competitive exam is. So the topics that I have covered is number system, LCMC, square root, cube root, simplification, ratio, proportion, average, percentage, partnership, problems on ages, profit and loss, discount, simple interest, compound interest, time and work, pipes and distance, allegation, mixture, time and distance, problems on train, boards and streams, races, permutation combination, probability, clock, calendar, quadratic equation, searchs and indices, arithmetic progression, geometric progression, area, perimeter, volume, surface, lion, angle, triangle, circle, ratio and identities, heights and distance and finally data interpretation. So totally I've covered 35 topics on quantitative aptitude and the total number of pages of the book is 533. So the price what we have fixed here is 599 including delivery charge. Right? You don't want to pay any additional charge for delivery. 599 is the fixed price and at any point this price will not be reduced as well as this price will not be increased. Right? So 599 is the price of the book. So thank you so much all and you can buy this book the description itself we have given the purchase link.

7IqqTJJK6RY,"So friends, first of all, thanks for being here in my YouTube channel. So finally, here is the printed copy of my first quantitative aptitude book. I was like very much happy because only because of you guys who supported me from the starting of the channel from 2016 till date. Thank you so much for all your support that you have given to us. And uh here is my book three years of artwork because I just uh wrote each and everything what a students exactly should learn for the upcoming competitive exams because competitive exam level is keep on getting I so I just want to write a book for each and every student those who are preparing for a competitive exam. So finally our book has been arrived. So from Sunday evening the book will be sale for life. So uh it will be on live from Sunday evening. So you can get my book on the first quantitative aptitude book on from Sunday evening. So I will notify you as well as I will post a separate video on it regarding the book. What are all the contents are there after unboxing my first book. So friends, thank you. Thanks a lot for all your support that you have given. So definitely from Sunday evening the book will be live. So thank you so much guys. See you on Sunday. Bye.",unknown
BwkDs-Yk364,"that is on the topic simple interest. So if you take a quantitative aptitude session that is especially for the bank exam. So there are two important topics. One is the simple interest and another is the component interest. In most of the prelims exam you can able to see two question will be asked from the simple interest or from the component interest of rupees,200. So the principle has been given because she had taken a loan. So 1,200 will be the principle with the simple interest for many years as the rate of interest. What is the meaning of it? For many years as the rate of interest. That means if the rate of interest is five, the years will be five. Understood or not? If the rate of interest is 10, the years will also be 10. That is the meaning of it. Just look at the word simple interest for as many years as the rate of interest. So how much rate of interest which will be equal to the number of time number of years right so here the years is also not given rate of interest is also not given but both the values will be same that's the point they are referring here find the gain in the transaction per year so just when you read the question what we need to find here just look at the last line of the question find the gain in the transaction per year what is the meaning of gain So we need to find the gain in the transaction. That means the difference the interest difference between both the cases. If we find what is the amount that he gains that means the difference between the simple interest one usually you will be getting if he borrowed for this much year and this much percentage but he is giving the amount to someone in a different rate of interest. So that we have to find what is the difference in the simple interest.",unknown
OoYE4Yck88M,"First of all, thanks for being here in my YouTube channel. So friends, before watching this video, do not forget these three things. So the first one the steady planner. So don't forget to watch the first video that is steady planner video. So download the PDF file based upon the schedule. I will be posting the video and kindly write the next day the same topic as a test only then you will get a practice. So first watch that video and then come and watch this video. Second is the test series. So every time on this based on the time schedule right what I have given on the study planner we will update the test on aptitude and reasoning test package. Students those who didn't buy the package buy it this year because it is only 99 rupees. Use the coupon code and purchase the test inside the test package you will have all the quantitative aptitude test as well as there is a separate test for upcoming IBBS RRB PO as well as clerk. And third important our first quantitative aptitude book. So just type interested and send to this WhatsApp number. Most probably we will release my first aptitude book this year. So after releasing the book we will notify you. Do not forget to purchase the book which will be very very important for this year and upcoming all the competitive exams. So friends, now let me move on to the special video for this year IBBS RRBP and RRB clear. So friends, now let me move on to this next topic for this year IBBS, RRBPO and clerk that is on the topic simple interest. So if you take a quantitative aptitude session that is especially for the bank exam. So there are two important topics. One is the simple interest and another is the component interest. In most of the prelims exam you can able to see two question will be asked from the simple interest or from the component interest. Usually when you see the previous year question papers of many batches. So from this topic alone on quantitative aptitude you can able to see minimum of two question in the prelims exam itself. So give more and more importance if you are preparing for the bank exam. And if you take simple interest so if you see the question simple interest on your exam try to solve it because simple interest usually does not have huge concepts. Calculation part will be uh very less. So simple interest will be very easy when compared to compound interest but compound interest have lots and lots of concepts and even the compound interest calculation parts will be more for example a compounded half compounded annually compounded quarterly and then there are concepts like uh installment basis that is also easy component interest also when compared to simple interest component interest also equally easy but the problem is the calculation part will be more so whenever you see simple interest in your exam first try to solve it. If you see compound interest try to solve the question at last in the prelims exam I'm saying right. So now here I have taken some of the important question recent year uh like different sort of question that was asked in the various exams. So now we will we are going to solve that year right. So after watching this video do not forget to take the test. So test will be very very important. Don't forget to take the test. Right. So now let me move on to the first question that is on the topic simple interest. So Reena took a loan of rups,200 with simple interest for many years at the rate of interest. If she paid rups 432 as a interest at the end of the loan period, what was the rate of interest? See our target is to find always first check what we need to find here. So what was the rate of interest? That means our target is to find the rate of interest here R. So we know the simple interest formula. Simple interest is equals to PNR by 100. So whether all the values are given in the question just check that Reena took a loan of rupees,200. So the principle has been given because she had taken a loan. So 1,200 will be the principle with the simple interest for many years as the rate of interest. What is the meaning of it? For many years as the rate of interest. That means if the rate of interest is five, the years will be five. Understood or not? If the rate of interest is 10, the years will also be 10. That is the meaning of it. Just look at the word simple interest for as many years as the rate of interest. So how much rate of interest which will be equal to the number of time number of years, right? So year the years is also not given. Rate of interest is also not given. But both the values will be same. That's the point they are referring here. And then I think if she paid 432 as an interest, so simple interest is also given which is 432. So I think it is easy to solve because we know the formula simple interest is equals to P NR by 100 where the simple interest will be 432 so is equals to the principal. So principal the amount what the person has borrowed number of years x rate of interest will also be x just now I have told you right so divided by 100 and now according to the question our target is to find what is the rate of interest so we can cancel 0 0 we can cancel 0 0 so x² is equ= to 432 / 12 so once we cancel this 3 * 36 so remaining will be 6 * so x² square is equ= to 36. So x is equ= to 6. So finally we got the value x= to 6. That means the rate of interest will be 6 percentage. And in case if they're asking what is the time duration? Time duration will also be 6 years because we know that the time duration as well as the rate of interest both are same. So make a note of it. This is the most important part here. The meaning of that sentence should be everyone should know it right for as many years as the rate of interest. So what will be the rate of interest? Rate of interest can be any number but that number will be same as the number of years right. So this will be the answer for the first question. So here a person borrows rups 5,000 for 2 years at 4 percentage peranom simple interest. he immediately lent it to an another person at 6.25 percentage perom for 2 years. Find the gain in the transaction per year. So just when you read the question what we need to find here just look at the last line of the question. Find the gain in the transaction per year. What is the meaning of gain? So we need to find the gain in the transaction. That means he the person is giving the money to two different person right just see first a person borrows okay he borrows something that means he is borrowing 5,000 rupees so 5,000 he is borrowing that is for how many years for 2 years first data for 2 years and four percentage peranom so this will be the first data what what the person has been borrowed for some rate of interest and for some years so what is the ne next point they have given here is e im immediately ly lent it to the another person. That means the same amount what he borrowed he had given to an another person that is 6.25%age.25 percentage perom and for how many years? 2 years. So E borrowed initially this much and after borrowing he immediately lend it to another person the same amount but the same amount was not given but we have to assume like this because E borrowed 5,000 and I'm if I'm borrowing 5,000 I'm I'm going to give the same amount to another person to gain some money. So our target is to find the interest usually he got if he borrowed from this amount. If he have given this amount on another person and for this year and this percentage he will get some gain that means the difference the interest between both the cases. If we find what is the amount that he gains that means the difference between the simple interest one usually will be getting if he borrowed for this much year and this much percentage but he is giving the amount to someone in a different rate of interest. So that we have to find what is the difference in the simple interest. So that means the simple interest one difference of simple interest 2. So simple interest 1 PNR by 100. We have a principle 5,000. N will be number of years 2 rate of interest will be four. So divided by PNR by 100. So 100 minus of similarly 5,000 will be the second value. Number of years is same and 6.25 percentage. So divided by 100. So now if we find the value 0 0 so 4 into 2 will be 8 8 5 are 40 which will be 400. So difference of cancel 0 0 0 here. So 6.5 into 50 into 2 will be 100. So 100 into 625 will be 625 6.25 will be 625 and see what is the difference he's getting. So in case if he invested he he borrowed this much for this much of rate of interest for 2 years the simple interest what he would have got is 400 but now because of giving the same borrowed money to an another person with a different rate of interest he is getting how much 625 so what is the amount that he is gaining here so 225 rupees is the amount what he got additionally so that's what they are asking in the question right find the gain in the transaction per year So we have got it for 2 years because 2 years year we have found it. But in case if they're asking for a year divide by two understood or not this is the interest what he got for 2 years. But according to the question find the gain in the transaction per year. That means for one year we need to find the answer divide by two. So divide by two will be 112.5 which will be the answer for this question. So friends understood or not? So this is the way you have to understand the question most probably uh recent year prelims exams the questions are very easy but the thing is understanding the question is nowadays very difficult right so you have to properly understand the question what exactly they're asking and what we need to find so that is the most important part here so try to understand the question properly and try to analyze what what are all the values they have given in the question and what we need to find. After finding the final answer, do not directly go and mark the option. Just check the question again what we need to find whether for 2 years or for 1 year or for 6 months based upon it mark the option. Right? So this will be the answer for the second question. Next question. So the simple interest on a certain sum for 8 months 4 percentage perom is 129 less than the simple interest on a same sum for 15 months at 5 percentage peranom. So the sum is so after reading this question we can able to see what is our target the sums that means our target is to find the principal year and look at the one important word in the question where 129 less than that means the first simple interest and the se second simple interest so 129 rupees less that means I've told this concept on many videos so if I am having 1,000 rupees and you are having 1,50 rupees then the difference between both the amount what we have is 50 rupees because I'm having 1,000 you are having,50 so you are having 50 rupees more I am having 50 rupees less the meaning is the difference between both the amount what we have is 50 so similarly here 129 less than the simple interest that means the simple interest 1 difference of simple interest 2 is equals to 129 so simple interest 1 will be PNR by 100 minus of PN NR by 100 is equals to 129. So now here according to the question the principle has not given. So let's assume P as it is. But be careful on number of years. Just see where the rate of interest is 4 percentage perom they have given for an year rate of interest. What about the duration 8 months? So here the number of years has been given in terms of month. So we have to convert in terms of year 8 divided by 12 into the rate of interest. So rate of interest is how much? 4 percentage perom. So divided by 100. So friends understood similarly. So now we converted rate of interest in terms of years. N in terms of years. Why we converted here? Because here it it is in terms of months. Second value again the same principle number of years. So number of years is how much? On the second case 15 months again convert into years. 15 by 12 and second rate of interest is five that's it so now according to the question our target is to find what is the principle so now we have to solve it and we need to find the answer that's it right so now I think we can cancel it 1/4 are four we can directly cancel this 25 times so now this value what we have is p / 8 12 into 25 so again we We can cancel it on two table this will be 4 2's are 8 4 3's are 12 yes minus of so similarly we can cancel it 1 * this will be 20 so p into 15 / 12 into 20 is equals to 129 so now I think we can cancel it on five table or else we can cancel it on four table so no four table is not possible cancel it on three table right five threes are 15 4 3's are 12 1 5 are 5 5 4's are 20 so now we have 4 P here right so 4 P into 25 I think we can we have two what we have canled here we have canceled it on two table 4 2's are 8 or we can directly cancel it on four table 4 2's are 8 4 3's are 12 so this will be 2 P so divided by 25 into 3 will be 75 yes so minus of we have only P here in the numerator here. So divided by 16 is equals to 129. So now we can take LCM here. So 16 into 2. So 16 into 2 will be 32. So 32P difference of 75p is equals to 129 into 75 into 16. So once I've taken LCM 75 into 16. So cross multiplying here 16 into 2 will be 32. 75 into P will be 75p is equals to 129 into 75 into 16. So I have multiplied here. So this will be 43. Principal is equals to 129 75 into 16. So this will be 3 * So principle is equals to 75 into 3 and else 16 into 3 will be 48 into 75 which will be 36 0. So friends finally answer for this question the principle what we got here is 3,600 which is the answer for this question right so try to understand the question properly that's what I'm repeatedly saying because in the previous question is also a same concept because in the previous question our target is to find what is this difference for finding the difference they have given a word gain that means the interest what he got in the first case and the second case how How much more he is getting which is called as gain. But here in this question what they have mentioned is one person is getting 129 rupees less than other. That means the difference between both the simple interest cases is 129. In case if he's getting total of 129 then you have to add both the interest. So that's the logic here to solve the question. The first frame of the equation right. So this will be the part which is most important for the questions. Right? So this will be the answer for this question which is 3,600. Next question. So OMA invested rups 2,400 in simple interest at a rate of r percentage perom for 4 years and after 4 years the total amount received by um is double the amount what is invested. If the rate of interest is decreased by 10 percentage then they find the interest received by Uma after five years. So first let we try to understand this question properly right. So Umar invested rups 2,400 in the simple interest. So she is invested some amount that means the principal amount has been given which is 2,400 and he invested the amount for certain rate of interest that rate of interest is not given for how many years? for 4 years. After 4 years, the total amount received by OMA, that means the amount what she received a value, principal plus interest, understood or not? Because principal plus interest, the total amount what she received is double the amount invested. That means after 4 years, E he invested 2,400. Actually, this is the amount what she invested. But after 4 years, she is getting double the amount. That means 4,800. She will be getting 4,800. When she will be getting 4,800 after how many years? After 4 years. So we know all the values in the question 24,400. Simple interest formula PNR by 100. Right? So P is 24, 400. And this interest plus principle equals to the total amount. So interest 2,400 and how many years she was investing for 4 years. So four into the rate of interest is unknown. Let keep it as r as it is. So plus 100 + 2,400. So friends understood or not? So simple interest plus principle what she is invested for 4 years. After 4 years she is getting twice that means double the amount what she has invested. So this will be 4,800 is equals to we can cancel 2 0 2 0 here. 4s are 16 remainder will be 1. 4 2's are 1 and 8. So 96R + 2,400. So once we subtract again 24,400 is equals to 96R. So now after finding the rate of interest here they have mentioned a small word that the rate of interest has been decreased by 10. So first what we can do here is we can find what is the actual rate of interest. So rate of interest is equals to 24,400 divided by 96. So I think uh two times right so 2 * 5 95 are 45. So rate of interest what we got here is 25%. So according to the first data what they have given in the question where the rate of interest is 25. So now what they are saying is the rate of interest is decreased by 10. Actual rate of interest is 25. If it is decreased by 10 then now the current rate of interest is 15%age. So now our target is to find what is the interest that was received by her after 5 years. The principal will be same everything will be same but what we need to find here is now what is the rate of interest that what is the interest that she was receiving after 5 years. Simple interest where rate of interest is 15 decreased by 10 into 5 years divided by 100. So this is the value what they are actually asking in the question. So now we need to cancel it. So 2020 2 0 here. So 24 into 75 is equals to 24 into 70 18 0 0. So 180 0 will be the answer here. So she will be getting an interest of,800. So which will be the answer for this question. So when understood or not how we are finding the answer. So the major part here in this question is to understand how I wrote this because a simple concept after after four years yes after four years she is getting double the amount what she invested that means after 4 years investment amount plus interest he will be getting so what is the invested amount 2400 and what is the interest that person she will be getting PNR by 100 the formula so 2400 what she had invested plus interest what she is getting for 4 years resultant will be the final amount you will be getting. So that final amount is double that means 2,400 into 2. So we have wrote this equation and we found what is the r. So now according to the question what they are saying is now that after finding the rate of interest now the rate of interest has been decreased by 10. So 25 minus 10. So after it is decreased by 10. So now our target to find what what will be the interest she was getting after 5 years. So after 5 years she will be getting an amount of,800 which will be the answer for this question. Next question. So Abbe gave rups 1,200 on loan some amount he gave at 4 percentage perom on simple interest remaining at 5% peranom on simple interest. After 2 years he got rupees 110 as interest. Then the amount given at 4 percentage 5 percentage perom in the simple interest find the largest amount of principle. So when just listen here listen the question carefully. Abbeby is giving 1,200 on a loan and some amount he gave at 4 percentage perom and I have told this concept on many on quantitative aptitude topic like if one amount is splitted to two different persons right so here he had given some amount to the first person and the remaining amount to the second person always remember that let's assume the first person x from,200 x is the amount that was given to the first person so the remaining 1,2 200 minus x will be the remaining amount that was given to the second person. Right? So now according to the question he is getting after 2 years he is getting the total interest from the first person and the second person total interest is how much? 110. So that means the simple interest one plus simple interest to two is equals to 110. So now simple interest one simple interest one will be PNR by 100 principle is X rate of interest so rate of interest what they have given is four and number of years will be 2 divided by 100 so plus next principle 1,200 minus of X into so where rate of interest and number of years number of years is two because after 2 years you will be getting the total amount of 110 and what will be the rate of interest here which is 5%age so 5 into 2 divided by 100 is equals to 110. So simple interest to one simple interest to two after 2 years the person what he is getting is 110. So now our target is to find what is the value of x and then we have to find what is the largest amount that's the principal value. So now what we can do here is either we try to cancel it or else I think we can cancel here itself one times this will be uh if you cancel it on two table I'm saying 50. So if you cancel it on two table again two times this will be 25 2's are 50. So finally 2x by 25 will be the first term. Second term 1,200 minus of x 52s are 10 you can cancel directly 10 times is equals to 110. So now we can take an LCM of 50 here. So if I take LCM as 50 so this will be 2 * 4x. So plus this will be five times. So 5 into,200 minus of 5x is equals to 110 into 50. So which will be okay. So 4x - 5x will be minus of x. When you bring that minus of x towards right hand side it becomes + x. So now this will be 0 0 5 2's are 10 remaining will be 1 6,000. So minus of 5 0 0. So x is equals to 500. So finally the value what we got here is x is equals to 500. That means the from,200 for the first person he had given 500 rupees. And what about the second person because the total is 1,200. So second person he will be giving the remaining amount of 700. So now according to the question our target to find the largest amount of principle. So the largest amount of principle what the person is getting is 700. So answer for this question is 700. Right? So friends understood or not? Right? So this is the way we have to solve the question on the topic simple interest. Try to learn all the different cases. Right? So total amount given and then total interest to what he is getting for five years he's getting this much of amount for 10 years how much amount he will be getting. So try to solve keep on solving more number of questions. So only then you can able to crack the questions in the recent year competitive exams because the recent year competitive exams like they are not asking you a difficult sort of question. They are asking you a very small question but lots of uh question tricks are there right? We have to understand the question properly and then only we can able to solve it without understanding the question because of time managements I have seen many students will solve very fastly but they make a mistake so don't do it right so nowadays exams are different make sure to learn all the different cases so friends thank you so much for watching this video and if you really like it share this video to your friends those who are preparing for the competitive exams and again don't forget to take the test so test will always make you the time management. So friends, thank you so much.",unknown
ntRqn7yp6Ys,"First of all, thanks for being here in my YouTube channel. So friends, before watching this video, do not forget these three things. So the first one the steady planner. So don't forget to watch the first video that is steady planner video. So download the PDF file based upon the schedule. I will be posting the video and kindly write the next day the same topic as a test only then you will get a practice. So first watch that video and then come and watch this video. Second is the test series. So every time on this based on the time schedule right what I have given on the study planner we will update the test on aptitude and reasoning test package. Students those who didn't buy the package buy it this year because it is only 99 rupees. Use the coupon code and purchase the test inside the test package you will have all the quantitative aptitude test as well as there is a separate test for upcoming IBBS RRB PO as well as clerk. And third important our first quantitative aptitude book. So just type interested and send to this WhatsApp number. Most probably we will release my first aptitude book this year. So after releasing the book we will notify you. Do not forget to purchase the book which will be very very important for this year and upcoming all the competitive exams. So friends, now let me move on to the special video for this year IBBS RRBP and RRB clears. So friends, now let me move on to the next video that is for this year IBBS RRBPO and RRB clerk. So that is on the topic average. So when you take an average topic in quantitative aptitude in every prelims exam you can able to see one question from this topic and in the mains exams you can able to see this topic on data interpretation concept right usually there will be some values like cricket based question. So the question that is related to a cricket based question and then a teacher and a student based question. So these two concepts plays a major role in the topic average. Right? So for example there are 30 students in a class and the average weight is this much. And then a new teacher enter into a classroom. So because of that teacher enter into a classroom where the uh average has been increased or decreased. So that because of this what is the age of the teacher? So this happens. So what will be the age of the teacher or the overall average gets decreases. So if it gets decreases then what will be the age of the teacher or what will be the weight of the teacher. So those kind of question usually you can able to see on the prelims exam. So when you target this concept question that is cricket based concept question from 2016 right from 20 year 2016. So till date right you previous year when you look into all the model question papers right so memory based question papers of various competitive exams you can able to see the question that was related to average that to based on the cricket based question has been asked many times on many different exams totally there are 11 players and player one score this much player two score will not be given player three average will be given for the 10 matches so we have to calculate the average first and then we have to calculate each person what is the score on every match and then we have to solve the complete data interpretation. and it it will be asked in the mains level. Right? So when you take an average, we don't have any formulas to solve. We don't have any separate formula to solve a question. Just a basics of average is enough to solve 100%age of the question on the topic. Right? So try to understand what is the basics of average. I have already posted many videos on my channel starting from lesson number one on the topic average. So learn try to learn the average basics first from lesson number one. What is average? How to calculate an average? If one person enter into a group, why the average changes? Why the average increases? If one person left the group, why the average is getting decreases? So if you learn all those concepts, then you you don't want to watch my video you can surely solve on the questions on your own. So be strong on the foundations. Basics are more and more important. So without that you can't able to solve this question. Right? So friends now let me move on to all the important question that is on the topic IBS RBP and click on the topic average question number one. So in a furniture shop there are some tables and some chairs. So the average price of the table is 2800 and that of average chair is 2250 and the average price of both the chairs and the table is 2590. If the number of tables is 15, find the total number of tables and office chair in a shop. So friends, when you look at the question carefully, our target is to find what is the average of total number of chairs and the tables. But here they have given one point that the total number of table is 15. So but we don't know what is the total number of chairs here. So first let we find what is the total number of chairs, right? And then we can able to easily find what will be the total average of charts and table. So now when you look at the question carefully we know that there are totally 15 tables and 15 table average is how much? 2,800. So we can say that the total cost will be 2,000 how much? 2,800. So into 15. So this resultant will be the total number of tables. So now whether we know what is the total number of chairs office chairs that was not given. So we can say that the total number of chars was not given so into X but they have given the average. So average of total number of charge is how much? 2500. So 2500 is the average chair into X resultant will be the total char. Right? So similarly total costing of the chair. So similarly the total costing of the table will be 15 into 2,800. So now we can say that 2,800 into 15 plus 2500 into x divided by average I'm going to calculate the average. So table and the chair divided by so 15 table plus we don't know how many chairs are there. So resultant average the total average of table and the chair has been given which is 2590 is equals to 2590. So now we can solve this right. So I think uh we have to multiply this no other way. Okay. So let's multiply this. So 0 0. So 8 5 are 40. So remaining will be 4. 5 2's are 10 18 22. So remaining will be 2. So 42,000. So 42,000 + 2,500x is equals to 2590 into 15. So plus 2590 into x. So when you subtract 5,500 2,500 this will be 90x, right? So 90x 42,000 difference of uh into 15 4 20 9 2 5 2's are 10 12 so 9 52 so 5 183 so 3885 so now we can cancel 0 and zero here because this we need to find the difference right we have to subtract subract 42,000 - 38,850. So resultant here we have 1,000 39 3's are 18 35 so x is equals to 35. So 35 will be the total number of chairs here. Right? Now we have found by using this logic what are all the values they have given in the question. We already know that what is the total number of tables. So by using it now we found what is the total number of chair which is 35. So 35 is the total number of chair and the total number of table is 15. So now according to the question our target is to find what is the average of total number of chairs and office tables. So total number of chairs plus total number of office table which will be 35 + 15. 35 + 15 will be 50. So 50 divided by 2 will be 25. So answer for this question is 25. So 25 is the average. So which will be the answer for this question. So friends understood or not? So this is the way we have to understand the question what they have given what we need to find out how to frame the equation. So this is basics right? So this is not a formula this is the basics of average. So sum of observation divided by total observation is equals to the total. So total has been given and sum of total observation divided by the observation. Right? 15 plus x will be the total. So by using that basic logic I think all the question we apply the same concept. Sometimes the value will be given, sometimes the value will not be given. So we have to assumed it as X and we have to solve the question that will be the difference. Right? So answer for the first question is 25. Question number two. So the average height of 100 student is 84 cm and the average height of boys is 80 cm and average height of girls is 90 cm. So find the total number of boys and girls in a class. So here in this question we know the total number of classroom strength which is 100. So 100 students we don't know how many boys and how many girls are there. So first what we can do here is if there are x is the number of boys. Let's assume so boys will be x number. So remaining 100 minus x will be girls. Yes or no? Because if the total has been given from the total if we don't know what is the total number of boys and girls. So first let's assume x as boys or remaining will be girls. So now according to the question where the average height of the boy is 80 cm. So we know that the total number of boys is x and the average is 80. So plus and the total number of girls will be 100 minus x and the average of the girls is how much? 90 cm. So is equals to and the total average of the complete class is also given in the question. 100 students 84 cm. So which will be 100 into 84. So 100 into 84 will be the total and the boys into 80 girls into 90. So resultant we will get what is the value of x. So if we get the what the total number of boys here then getting the total number of girls is also easy and then according to the question our target is to find the ratio here right. So just this part alone is important in the question how we frame the equation. There are different different way you can frame the equation but while teaching itself I have told you always try to frame an equation in a single step. Do not calculate separately there is a chance of making a mistake. So make sure to frame all the thing in a single equation and if you solve that equation you will surely get the value of x. Right? So now here you can see 80x + 9,000 minus of 90x is equals to 8,400. So this will be 90x 80x 10 x when you bring the 10 x towards right hand side it becomes + 10 x is equals to so 9,000 - 8,400 will be 600. So once you cancel it x is equals to 60 that means the total number of boys out of 100 will be 60. So remaining will be the total number of girls. So now we got boys and girls according to the question our target is to find the ratio. So if you cancel it this will be 3 is to2. So our target is to find the ratio right find the ratio of number of boys and girls. So finally the ratio of total number of boys and girls is 3 is to2. So which will be answer for this question right? So friends understood or not always practice more and more number of question only to frame this equation that is alone important here. So this is the most important part in the question. Next question. So the average mark scored by X students in a class is 75 and the average mark scored by the boys in a class is 69 and the average mark scored by this girls is 85. Then the number of girls in the class is what percentage of total number of boys in a class. See our target is to find the number of girls in a class is what percentage of that means our target is to find X is what percentage of Y. So girls should be in the numerator, boys should be in the denominator into 100. So that is the target we need to find in the question right. So first year in the previous question right just see the difference between previous question and in this question. So previous question they have given the total number of student as 100 and we assumed X will be the total number of boys and 100 minus X will be the total number of girls. Right? So this is the way we solve the previous question. But here in this question the total number of students itself it's not given which is x. So now inside this total number of students we have boys as well as we have girls. But we don't know how many boys are there and how many girls are there. So let's assume there are some boys and some girls. So resultant total boys and girls will be x. So now according to the question what they are saying is where the average scored by the boys in the class is 69. So 69 into boys right? So 69 into boys plus girls is how much? And the average scored by the girls is 85. So 85 into girls is equals to initially they have given the total strength of average will be 75. So 75 into the total number of strength in the classroom which will be boys and girls. So means understood or not? Right. So previous question they have given the total. So we have solved the question by assuming it as X. But here in this question the total was not given they do they have given it as X. So inside the X we have boys as well as we have some girls. So we can assume as boys and girls and then we can frame a equation. So total number of boys into their average. So total number of girls into average and total strength into boys and girls. So now we can solve it. So 69 boys plus 85 girls is equals to 75 boys plus 75 girls. So now 69 boys when you bring the boys towards right hand side which becomes 75. 75 69 will be six boys is equals to so 85 and 75 will be 10. So 10 girls. So boys by girls is equals to 10 divided by 6 which will be 5 / 3. So finally we got the total number of boys and girls is 5 by3. So boys is how much? Five. Girl is how much? Three. And now our target is to find not this value. Our target is to find x is what percentage of y that means girls is what percentage of total number of boys. So girl will be three boys will be five into 100. So resultant will be 20 which is 60%age. So the total number of girls is what percentage of total number of boys resultant will be 60. Right? So friends this is the area right? Every question I'm saying this this is the important part of the question. So try to understand what is the difference every time while learning try to understand what is the difference. what is the difference between previous question while solving itself I am saying right try to have a separate note and try to solve it on your own so that you can solve these kinds of questions easily right so answer for this question where the total will be 60%age next question so the average mark obtained by A B C are X the average mark obtained by A and B are X + 4 and the average mark obtained by B and C are X if half of the mark obtained by A are 52 less than the mark obtained by B. Find the total marks obtained by A and C. So I think this question is completely based upon the mark of A, B and C. So first what we can do here is they have given one important clue to frame a equation where half of the mark obtained by A are 52 less than the total mark obtained by B. That means the difference between A and B mark is 52 right. So but okay so let's find initially by value of A B and the C because they have given the average mark obtained by all the three is X. So we can say that A + B + C right the average total three person is equals to X. So we can say that the total A + B + C will be 3X. So 3X will be the sum of the marks of all the three persons. Second point the average mark obtained by A and C. Okay. So average mark A and B that means two person A and B is equals to X + 4. So resultant will be A + B is equals to 2 into X + 4 that means 2 X + 8. So 2 X + 8 will be the average mark that is the total mark that is obtained by A and B. So A and B will be 2X + 8. I think we can substitute instead of a and b we can substitute 2x + 8 so that we can get what will be the value of c. So if you substitute a and b here instead of this equation so resultant will be 2x + 8 + c is equals to 3x. So c is equals to so 3x - 2x will be x x - 8. So x - 8 will be the value of c. So now what they have given us is another point and the average mark obtained by B and C are X. So average mark that is obtained by B and C divided by 2 is equals to X. That means B + C is equals to 2X. I think we already got the value of C here. So substitute C here. So which will be B + X - 8 is equ= to 2X. So B is equals to 2X - X will be X. x + 8. So x + 8 will be the value of b and value of c will be x - 8 and value of a + b will be 2x + 8. So I think if you substitute b is equals to x + 8 here, we will get what will be the value of a and then we can solve this equation easily, right? Just substitute instead of b x + 8. So if you substitute instead of b x + 8 resultant will be a + x + 8 is equals to so 2x + 8 will be the total here. So a is equals to 2x - x will be x 8 - 8 will be zero. So finally we got a b and c. So now according to the question what we need to find here is the total marks obtained by a and c. Okay. So we need to find what is the total mark that was obtained by A and C and they have given a clue that if half of the mark obtained by A. So A of so we already know that the mark obtained by A is X. So half of it so X divided by two. So is 52 less than the total mark obtained by B. Okay. So 52 less than the total mark obtained by B. Total mark obtained by B is X + 8. So x + 8 will be the total mark that is obtained by b half of the mark of a where the difference will be 52 because it is 52 less right if it is 52 less that means the difference so difference between both the value will be 52 right so 2x + 16 minus of x is equals to so 52 into 2 which will be 1 4 so now 2x minus of x will be x 16 and 1 4 will 88. So we can say that the value of x will be 88. So now we got the value of x is equals to 88. So our target is to find what is the total mark obtained by a and c. So c is how much? x - 8. That means 88 - 8 will be 80. So 88 + 80 resultant will be 168. So 168 will be the total score that was obtained by a and c according to the question. Right? So initially what what we did is I think all the value has been directly given in the question but our target is to first find what will be the value of a b and c. So once if we find all the three% marks obtained then solving the question seems to be easy here right. So answer for this question is 168. Next question. So in a class the average weight of 25 student is x kg. If two student two two new student joined the class whereas the weight were 59 kg and 75 kg. So the average weight of the class would have been increased by 5 percentage. Find the value of x. So here in this question our target is to find what is the value of x. Right? What are the values are already given in a class? The average weight of 25 student is x. That means the total number of students in a classroom is 25 and their average is x. That means if 25 into x resultant will be the total number of weight of the classroom. So now second point if two new students joined where the weight will be 59 and 75 kg to two new students entering into the class and the direct weight of both the student has been given. So already there are 25 students. So 25 into x will be the total weight of 25 students. So now in this 25 students two new students are joining. So one student weight is 59 and another student weight is 75. So totally how many students are there? 25 plus two student 27 students. So totally there are 27 students right and here the numerator is 25 x will be the total weight of 25 student and then 26th student and 27 students so divided by 27 is equals to so actually the average of 25 student is x but now because of two students entered into this classroom where the average weight has been increased by 5%age that means not 5% or else you can find what is 5% percentage of X and then we can add the better way is always to go with 1.5 percentage because the the weight has been increased by how much what they are saying is 5%age increase that means 1.5%age right so now we can cancel it this will be 25x + 7 54 so remainder will be 1 so 12 + 7 will be 13 is equals to so 5 / 100x so into 27 right when you multiply this 27. So now we have I think we can cancel this on 25. No, we can't able to cancel it. So no other way. So let's let's uh cancel it on five table. This will be 20. Cancel it on five table. This will be 21. So we can multiply 20 here. So this will be 250x plus so 0 4 2's are 8. So this will be 6 2 is equals to 21x into 27. So now 250 and 21 into 27. So 21 into 27. So 7 14 161 567. So 5 67x minus of 250x is equals to 2680 80. So now we can cancel it. So 267 250 it's 500 right? We have to multiply by 20. So it's not 10 20 500. So this will be 67x is equals to 2680. So x is equals to 40. So finally we got is 6 7 4 are 28 24 26 yes 40. So finally we got the value of x is equals to 40 that that's the target here to find our target is is to find what is the value of x. So finally we found the value of x is equals to 40. Right? So this is the way this is the important part in the question. Some students will find what is five percentage of x and then they will again add with five. So don't make all those mistakes because those are the places where we will make a mistake on calculation. So make sure that I have told many times on while teaching profit and loss a previous video percentage also I have told you right if it is 70% less calculate what is 30. So that will be the because if it is 70%age less you don't want to find what is 70%age of the number and you don't want to subtract it better find what is 30%age of the number. If the value has been increased by five better don't find what is five better convert it as 1 not five so that you will get the exact answer in a single step you don't want to calculate two or more step right so now answer for this question is where x is equals to 40 that that's what we need to find here right it's find yes find the value of x so x is equals to 40 so next question so there are 40 students in a class and their average height is x cm cm. So the ratio of the number of boys to girls is 5 is to 3. If the average height of the boy is x - 12 cm then the average height of the girl is 140 cm. Find 50%age of value of x. So friends when you look at the question carefully the total number of student has been given which is 40 and out of 40 we don't know how many boys and how many girls are there. But at the second point they have mentioned that the ratio of boys to girls is 5 is to 3. That means if total is 40 and the ratio of boys and girl is five is to three. So five part out of total eight part where five part will be boys. So 8 fs are 40. It's equals to 25. So 25 will be the total number of boys. So the remaining 15 will be the total number of girls because we already know that the total strength of the classroom is 40. If 25 is total number of boys, so 15 will be the total number of girls. So now according to the question, so what they have given in the first point is there are 40 students in a class and the average weight is x cm. So 40 into x. So 40 into x will be the total height. They're talking about height. Okay. So total height of the classroom will be 40 into x. So now let's equals to the total boys and the girls. So boys is how much? 25. So 25 is the total number of boys out of this boys where the height average height is how much? X - 12. So X - 12. So plus 15 will be the total number of girls and the average height is how much? 140. So 15 into 140. That's it. So now our target is to find what is the 50%age of value of X. So first we need to find what is X and then we need to find what is 50% of X. Right? So now it is 40x is equals to so 25x minus of 25 into 10 will be 250. So 25 into 2. So 25 into 10 will be 250. 25 into 2 will be 50. So 250 + 50 will be 300. So minus of 300. So plus 0 5 4's are 20. So remaining will be 2. So 9 9 + 2 will be 11. So remaining will be 1. So 2,00. So when you bring this towards left hand side, it becomes 15x is equals to. So this will be,800. So x is equals to 120. So resultant value where x is equals to 120. But this is not the final answer because our target is to find what is 50%age of this number. So 50 percentage of this number is 60. So answer for this question is 60 cm right. So again this part right. So this part is important in this question. Yes or no right? In most of the average question you can able to see that equation framing an equation part is the most important thing because we don't have any formulas here. If we have a formula then we we have to think and we need to apply enough formula but here we don't have any formulas just we need to understand. So this is the total and out of this total we have boys and girls. So boys girls plus is equals to total. So boys and girls plus sum will be equals to total. So similarly in the previous question there also they have given a total. So we added to and equal to the total and sometimes the total number of classroom strength will be given and sometimes the total number of classroom strength will not be given. So based upon that we need to solve the question. Right? So friends practice more. Right? Practice is more and more needed. uh just go and write the test. I have given a separate test for you for this year IBBS exam. So I've told you everything in the uh starting of this video. Write the test right inside the test package. You have a separate topic average test as well as you have an average alone especially for IBS exam. So write the test. If you keep on practicing based upon the timings and surely you can able to get the time management and practice as well as you will get that speed. So friends, thank you so much for watching this video and if you really like it, share this video to your friends those who are preparing for the competitive exams. So thank you so much. Bye.",unknown
ff1ZNjRZfug,"First of all, thanks for being here in my YouTube channel. So friends, before watching this video, do not forget these three things. So the first one the steady planner. So don't forget to watch the first video that is steady planner video. So download the PDF file based upon the schedule. I will be posting the video and kindly write the next day the same topic as a test only then you will get a practice. So first watch that video and then come and watch this video. Second is the test series. So every time on this based on the time schedule right what I have given on the study planner we will update the test on aptitude and reasoning test package. Students those who didn't buy the package buy it this year because it is only 99 rupees. Use the coupon code and purchase the test inside the test package you will have all the quantitative aptitude test as well as there is a separate test for upcoming IBBS RRB PO as well as clerk. And third important our first quantitative aptitude book. So just type interested and send to this WhatsApp number. Most probably we will release my first aptitude book this year. So after releasing the book we will notify you. Do not forget to purchase the book which will be very very important for this year and upcoming all the competitive exams. So friends, now let me move on to the special video for this year IBBS RRBPO and RRB clear. So friends, now let me move on to the fourth video that is on the topic percentage on quantitative aptitude session for this year IBBS RRB and RBPO and the clerk. Right? So when you take a percentage is one of the most most important topic on quantitative aptitude. So learn all the concepts in percentage because even the basics are important in the topic percentage because you need to uh for solving most of the question on quantitative aptitude we required the basics of ratio proportion and percentage only based on this we will be solving most of the question on topic quantitative aptitude right so when you take our bank exams previous year question papers of bank exam so in the topic percentage there are three concepts which are more and more important One is the question that is based on a marks marks based question. For example, a classroom strength will be given this much of boys and this much of girls are there. So boys score this much mark in mathematics. So girls score this much of marks in social science. So our target is to find if they need to score this much of mark percentage in total. So what should be the mark that was to be scored by boys and to be scored by girls. So those kinds of question that is based on a marks which was more important. And second that is based on a salary. So the person's salary will not be given or else sometimes they will give you a salary. From that amount the person will be spending some for education, transport, uh so food etc. And our target is to find what is the savings or else some value will be given in the question. Based upon that our target is to find what is the salary of the person. So based upon those concepts questions and then the last is the election based two candidate votes will be given. So one candidate score this much of vote and second candidates scored this much of vote majority will be given valid vote will be given invalid vote will be given. So so many concepts are there. So but these three concepts are more and more important. When we look look into the previous year question papers of bank exams, you can able to see more number of questions were asked only on the area marks as well as monthly based salary. And we look into the previous year mains level question papers like SBIPO, SBI clerk, IBSPO, IBBS clerk mains exam question papers where you can able to see the election based question was widely asked on various exams. Right? So give more and more importance to the percentage topic. So now I will be solving some of the important question here on the topic percentage. I hope you already watched my percentage video. If not kindly go to my YouTube channel, watch the complete percentage playlist because that is the basics of quantitative aptitude. Right? So watch all the video learn every each and every concept. So most of the questions I have taught you the shortcut method as well as traditional method. Learn both the method practice more right? So that surely you can crack any of the competitive exams. If you are strong on the foundation right so now let me move on to some of the question on the topic percentage first question so in a flower shop there are roses and lily are sold in which 40%age are roses and the remainings are lilies so out of the total number of flowers sold where 45%age are red color and the remaining are white color and the number of red colors fl is 180 which is 40%age of total Number of red color flies sold in a shop. So very interesting question. I think here they are talking about the two fls. One is rose and second is lily. So total number of flowers sold both the fl sold was not given in the question but other than that they have given most of the value. So first let's consider the total number of flowers which was sold right. So total number of fl sold let's assume it as 100x. Many students usually have a doubt why you are fixing it as 100x. Can I take it as 10x base number or else 500,000 x whatever you have taken a value you will you are going to get the same answer. But remember that if you fix a base number as 100 x or 100 you will not get any decimal value. If you fix 500 if you fix 10 x there are more chance of getting a decimal value. So that more and more chance while solving a question if it is a decimal point we might make a mistake right while multiplication or division there are chances of making a mistake so better always make it as a base number as 100 percentage or 100x that will be the easy way and to solve the question and without any mistake right so now the total number of fl sold was not given so I have considered it as 100x so first point what they are saying is where 40%age are roses. So out of 100 x if 40%age are roses then 40x will be the total number of roses because 40%age of 100 will be 40. So 40x will be the total number of roses. So what about the remaining will be lily. So lily will be 60. So 60 x will be the total number of lily fls. So now next point they are talking about red color and white color fl. What they are saying is out of the total number of flowers sold where 45%age are red color. So out of the total fl we already consider it as 100x. So now what they are saying is where 45%age are red color. So 45%age of 100x will be 45x. So 45x is of red color. So remaining 55x is of white color. So this is the second point what they have given in the question and look at the third point. So third point is and the number of red color FL sold is 180. So 180 is the total number of red color FL which was sold which is 45x. Right? This is the red color FL sold which is 40%age of total number of red color FL sold. So this 180 is equals to 40%age of the red color FL which was sold which is 45x. So 40%age we can cancel 1 zero here and here we have 1 zero. So 2 * 5 * 1 9 * 18 x. So 18 x is equ= to 180. So x is equ= to 10. So finally we got one value which is x is equals to 10. So if we got one value right then solving the complete question is easy because if you find x value even in the salary based question like e spending food the entertainment such if you find only one one value then getting all the remaining value will be easy in the topic percentage right just see x is equals to 10 by using that value it is easy to find what is the total number of roses and what is the total number of lily and here here in this question our target is to find what is the total number of lily sold in a So lily we have considered it as 60 x. So x is equals to 10. So 60 into 10 will be 600. So 600 will be the total number of lily that was sold. Very interesting question. Right? Understanding alone takes time. First time while learning I'm saying but if you are strong on the foundations then this will be easy right? Just like that you can crack and go. So this will be the answer for the first question. Question number two. So in an election only two candidate participated 80%age of the people cast their vote and 900 people did not cast their vote. So 25%age of the oats are declared invalid. If the winner won by 300 valid oats then find the total number of valid O got by the candidate who won. Right? So just now I have told you in the starting of this video election based questions are more important. I hope you already learned the basics by watching my video right only then you can understand the way that I'm solving here if not kindly learn the basics first and then watch this video right so now it's based on an election between two candidates right and the first candidate what they are saying is 80%age of the people cast their oat but we don't know how much 80%age how much oat it is but they have given another point that 900 people did not cast their oat so if 80% of the people cast their oat OS. So remaining is how much? Which is 20 because when you consider total 100%age where 80%age of the people cast their oats. So remaining will be 20 and this 20%age which is equals to 900 because this value is directly given in the question. Yes or no? 900 people did not cast their oat. So 20%age of the people did not cast their which is equals to 900. 80%age of the people cast their oat. We don't know how much 80 percentages. just no cross multiplied so we can cancel 0 and 0 here so x is equals to so 20 x is equals to 80 into 90 so now I think uh we have sorry we have canceled zero here right which is 2x so 2x is equals to 80 into 90 so we can cancel four times so x is equals to 3,600 so 3,600 is what the total number of odds now total number of votes that was cast in an election so which is 3,600. So now next two point because there are some votes are invalid I think. So yes 25%age of the oaths are declared invalid. So this is the total number of votes. So out of total number of votes if 25%age are declared invalid. That means the valid will be remaining 75%age. So 75%age will be the valid oats year. So we can cancel it on 25 table. So this will be three times. This will be four times. Again we can cancel it on four table 900. So 9 3's are 27. So 2,700. So this 2,700 is what? Total number of valid OS. So only out of this total number of valid OS we can able to find how much winner got and how much loser got. Right? By using this we can't able to find because uh if you need to check how much winner got we have to first eliminate the invalid OS. So we have eliminated the invalid and then out of the valid 2,700 we have to check how much the winner got and what they have said here is if the winner won by 300 valid that means buy right while teaching itself I have told you buy means the difference difference between winner and loser for example if loser score x number of vote then the winner would be getting x + 300 yes or no only then we can say the winner got 300 votes by one by 300 odds. So by means majority. Never forget this. I've told you many times while teaching the basics on election based question because these are the words are more and more important in that election based question concept. Right? So now if loser is X, winner will be getting 300 votes more than the loser. So now it is easy to find X + X + 300 which is equals to the total number of WS. So 2x is equals to 2,400. So x is equals to 12 0 0. So 1 1200 0 is what? X which is the loser out. So loser here who got 1,200. So winner will be getting 300s more than the loser. So 15 0 0. So now according to the question, what is the target here? Our target is to find total number of valid odds by the candidate who won. So who won is how much? 1,500. So the person who is getting,500 odds is the winner from the in the election right. So this will be the answer for the question. And many students again this is my style of solving a question and if you are studying in a different different institutions or an online classrooms every most of the teacher will teach it in a different way. They usually teach questions in a different different way. Shortcuts or traditional method or a different method. That's not at all a problem. You can solve any of the method you like. Right? But remember that usually if you follow some shortcuts there are chance of making a mistake. Do not follow shortcut first. Learn the traditional method. Learn the method that your teacher taught in an institution or a live class whatever be right. apply it to the all the questions and check whether you are getting the answer and then you can solve it on your way right but remember that the basics foundation are always important that's what I'm repeatedly saying it learn the basics properly right so that you can solve this question on different different logic so finally answer for this question is the winner got,500 next question so the total number of students in a school A and C is 25%age and 10 percentage more than the total number of students in school B. If the total number of students in school A is decreased by 50 and school C is increased by 30 then the total number of students in school A becomes 20 percentage less than that of school C. So find the total number of students in a school B. So friends here our target is to find what is the total number of students in school B. They're talking about three different school and the first point they are comparing school B with school A and C. Right? Just look at the first point. Total number of students in school A is 25 percentage and 10 percentage more. So let's take the total number of students in the school B as X because we don't know what is the total number of students in school B. They are comparing A and C with school B. So only have assumed as B as X. So now a what they are saying is how much more 25%age more than b. So we can say X into 125% of X right what about C here C will be 10 percentage more than the total number of students from school B so 10%age so X into 110 divided by 100 so we can cancel here so cancel it on 25 table this will be four and this will be five so total number of students in school A will be 5x 4 so total number of students in school C will be 11 x 10 and total number of students in school B will be X. So finally we got all the three values here. So now I think we our target is to always to find the value of X. So once we find the value of X solving the question will be simple. So now they have given a clue to find X here. Just look at the question. So where the school A is decreased by 50. School A strength which is 5X by 4. So now this has been decreased by 50. That means subtract 50. And similarly school C is increased by 30. What about school C year? 11X by 10. So this has been increased by 30. So plus 30. So this is for school C, right? And this is for school A. So decreased by 50, increased by 30. Resultant will be where school A becomes 20%age less than school C. For example, if school C is 100%age, then school A will be 80%. So mean understood or not? Because 20%age less compared to school C. So school C 20% less. So 100%age of school C then school A will be 20 20 percentage less that means 80%age. So we can cancel 100 percentage percentage here. We can cancel zero and zero here. So 8 by 10 again we can cancel it on two table. 4 2's are 8 5 2's are 10. So finally we got the right hand side part which will be 4x 5. So now I think we have to solve this question and we need to find what is the value of x. So let's solve this question here. So 5x so this can be written as 5x minus of take lcm as 4. So this will be 200 divided by 4. So completely divided by or multiplication just move on to the numerator. So this becomes 10 completely divided by so 11 x + 300. So 11 x + 300 is equals to 4 / 5. So now try to cancel cancel out the values here. So I think we can cancel this on two table. So 2 2's are four. This becomes 5 2's are 10. Again we can't able to cancel further it right. So let's let's multiply this value. So this will be 5x - 200 so into 5 into 5. So 5 into 5 will be 25 is equals to so 4 into 2 will be 8. So 8 into 11 x + 300. So friends understood or not. So now let's multiply this because our target is to find the value of x here. So we can multiply and we can find out the answer. So let's multiply this 25 into 5 will be 125x. So minus of 25 into 200 is equals to 88x + 8 into 300. So now 88x - 125. So 88. So here we have 12 and here we have 25. So 12 + 25. 35 and 37. So 37 x is equals to when you bring this towards right hand side it becomes plus 8 3's are 24. So 2,400. So 25 into 2 will be 50. So 5,000. So 37x this will be 7 4 0 0 is equals to 37x. So this will be 2 * so is equals to 200. So finally we got the value of x is equals to 200. So now according to the question our target is to find what is the total number of students in a school B. So school B we have already assumed it as X. So now we got the value of X is equals to 200 that means the total number of students in a school B is 200 which will be the answer for this question. So friends understood or not right. So understanding the question is important right and then you have to frame a equation and this is the most important part in the question right this is the part and this part is like they have given a clue directly if 50 students are less on school A and 30 students increased then it becomes this much of less when compared to so we can keep it as 100%age school C and A will be 20%age less which will be 80% and that 80% is equals to this and this will be this and then solving a question we have got what is the value of x next question so in a examination out of total number of questions where a attended 80%age of the question out of which the questions that was attended 60%age of the questions were correct and the remaining questions answer were incorrect so and each question the person has scored two marks and for every question that was wrong which was detected 0.5 5 marks and the total mark obtained by A is 80. Find the total number of questions in the examination. So when just just look at the question carefully where the total number of marks in that examination was not given. So let's assume the total number of marks in the examination as 100x always keep it as a base value. So let's assume it as 100 X. 100 X is the total number of mark that was in the examination. So now what they are saying is the number of question attended by A will be 80%age. So the person A is attending 80%age of the question. So if it is attending 80%age of the question then the total number of question that was attended by A will be 80X. Right? So now next point what they are saying is 60%age of the questions were correct. So the person A attend only 80X question. out of this 80x were 60%age of the question that was correct. So 60%age of 80. So total will be 48. So 48x will be the total number of question that was attended correctly. Right? That that's the point they have given. 60%age of the questions were correct. So out of 80 60%age of the questions were correct. Then what about the remaining? So if 48 out of 80 then the remaining will be 32. So 32 will be the total number of question that was incorrect where the person A made wrong. And now according to the question what they are saying is for every correct answer they are giving two marks. So 48x into 2 and then for every wrong answer they are deducting that means they are subtracting the mark from the total what the person A got. So now 48 question the person A got correctly. So 48 question for every question two mark and for every wrong question the total number of question which was wrong is 32X and out of this 32X for every wrong question the total score that was deducted will be 0.5. So for every question 0.5 has been deducted for a wrong answer. So 32 question were attended wrong 0.5 48 question were correct which is two equal to the total score that was got by the person is how much 80 so 80 is the total score so this is the point where it is most important in the question so I hope once you understood this point solving the complete question is easy so now just we need to multiply resultant will be 96x minus of 16x is equals to 80 So 90 80 x is equals to 80. So x is equals to 1. So finally we got the value of x is equal to 1. And what the says question we need to find find the number of questions in the examination. So we have assumed it as 100x. So now we got the value of x is equals to 1. So if you substitute x is equals to 1 year resultant will be 100. That means the total number of question that was asked in the examination is 100. So this will be the answer for this question. So friends understood or not how I solve the question right. So simple and easy first try to understand the concept that is what I'm repeatedly saying in the video. So once you understand the concept solving all the questions are simple. Next question. In an election only two candidates M and N contested. 30%age of the o did not okay. 30%age of the Otus did not owe their cast and,600 OS were declared invalid. So the winner got 4,800 OS more than the opponent where he scored 51%age OS of the total oats on the OT list. So once first try to understand the question clearly and uh if we you can solve this many students will ask me like how you will solve these kind of question faster because is there any other technique to solve? Yes, we have some basic techniques that we can apply here not on all the question but 90%age of the questions you can apply it. The technique here is usually there will be election between two candidates right so what usually the total number of votes so the winner who is going to win this election plus loser right winner plus loser so these are the two candidates who will be scoring the total number of valid OS yes or no right so total number of valid OS we don't know but this total number of valid OS will be splitted into winner and loser so winner how much got and loser how much total to vote got when you add these two votes resultant will be the total valid OS. So now let's find what is the total valid OS here just look at the question in the election between two candidates where the total vote was not given. So let's assume that the total odds as X because the total vote was not given in the question. So now the first point what they are saying is 30%age of the OTR did not vote. So if 30%age did not vote then 70%age of the voters were vote for this election right what is 70%age so 70%age of x and then second point 1,600 votes are declared invalid so out of valid 1,600 were invalid so minus of,600 yes so friends understood or not how I wrote this just just listen carefully where in the question what they are saying is 30%age of the did not oat so the remaining 70% percentage of the oat will be elected right they they cast their old 70%age out of this 70%age of the total oats that was cast where,6 were invalid. So when you subtract 1,600 this will be the total number of o that was got by winner and loser. So friends understood. So now we can cancel this 0 0. So resultant will be 7 x 10 minus of,600. So 7 x 10 minus,600 will be the total oats. So now this total oats is equals to winner and loser. So now so what is the next point? The winner y got 4,800 more than the opponent. Thus he scored 55%age of the odds. So the what they are saying is the winner. So M got M will be the winner because E got 4,800 modes oats more than the opponent. That means uh if E is getting and that that two they have given 51%age of the O. That means out of total OS the winner got 51%age. So we can say 51%age will be 51x by 100 because total number of votes will be X we have considered it. So out of the total number of votes X where the winner is getting 51%age. So 51x by 100 is the winner who is getting the to votes and the loser is what? 4,000 minus 51x divided by 100 minus of 4,800. Why? Because they have mentioned the point that the person M got 4,800 more than the opponent. That means M will be the winner. So if M is the winner who is getting 51%age of the total, then the loser will be getting 4,800 OS less when compared to this person. So this can be written as 51x by 100. So plus 51x by 100 minus of 4,800. So now this will be 1 2x / 100us of 7 x 10 is equals to 4,800 minus of,600. So we can cancel this will be 100 here. So 1 2x - of 70x is equals to 2,00. So this will be 3,200. So this will be 32x is equals to 3,200 into 100. And we can cancel this one time. So x will be 10,000. Right? So 10,000 we got the value of x. That means the total number of vote that was cast in the election will be 10,000 and then based upon that we can easily find what is the total number of votes valids total number of uh loser winner everything will be easy. So just our target is always to get the value of x. So just try to solve many number of questions right only then you can able to understand how we can solve the question easily. Most of the students want to solve the question in a single step because uh because of time management they always ask me I just want to solve this question fastly. Yes you can you can solve the question fastly but before that you have to solve many question like uh in the election based concept itself you have to solve more number of questions only then you will get an idea like how to solve it in a single step that requires more practice right. So friends, thank you so much for watching this video and if you really like it, share the video to your friends those who are preparing for the competitive exams and remember that after watching this video do not forget to write the test. So test was very very important for your exam only then you will get a time management and everything. So write the test first and then after the after writing a test analyze it what are all the mistakes that you have done and then learn all the remaining topics on my YouTube channel definitely will help you to clear your competitive exams. So friends thank you so much for watching it. Bye.",unknown
33MF6bOaLgA,"First of all, thanks for being here in my YouTube channel. So friends, before watching this video, do not forget these three things. So the first one the steady planner. So don't forget to watch the first video that is steady planner video. So download the PDF file based upon the schedule. I will be posting the video and kindly write the next day the same topic as a test only then you will get a practice. So first watch that video and then come and watch this video. Second is the test series. So every time on this based on the time schedule right what I have given on the study planner we will update the test on aptitude and reasoning test package. Students those who didn't buy the package buy it this year because it is only 99 rupees. Use the coupon code and purchase the test inside the test package you will have all the quantitative aptitude test as well as there is a separate test for upcoming IBBS RRB PO as well as clerk. And third important our first quantitative aptitude book. So just type interested and send to this WhatsApp number. Most probably we will release my first aptitude book this year. So after releasing the book we will notify you. Do not forget to purchase the book which will be very very important for this year and upcoming all the competitive exams. So friends, now let me move on to the special video for this year IBBS RRBPO and RRB clear. So friends, now let me move on to the second video for this year IBBS RRBPO and RRB clerk exam that is on the topic problems on ages. So problems on ages everyone knows it. It's one of the most most important topic in quantitative aptitude. In the prelims exam as well as in the mains exam you can able to see one or two questions on this topic and easy topic right we don't have any formulas here just we need to understand the question we need to frame a equation and then we need to find the answer for the given question. So be careful on only one area. After finding the final answer, just cross check once again with the question whether we need to find the percentage of the person or the past age or the future age. That is most important because many students usually they solve this question easily because we don't have any formulas to solve. Just we need to calculate the present age, future age or past age based upon the question. But the only problem is after finding the final answer, they just go and check the option. Don't do that. First after finding the final answer, just read the question again. What we need to find exactly here and then mark the options. Right? So that is the most important thing that you need to know in the topic problems on ages. So uh if you already learned the basics, you can watch this video or else kindly go and watch the basics of problems on ages on my YouTube channel itself. I have a separate playlist on problems on ages. So do not forget to watch the problems on ages playlist as well as I have posted one live class right on that is on the topic problems on ages. So make sure to watch that video and uh I have posted many videos on problems on ages right. So try to watch all those videos that I have posted for problems on ages so that you won't uh make any mistakes on your upcoming exams. Right? So now let me move on to the questions that is on the topic problems on ages. First question. So 9 years ago the ratio of Ahmed and Punit age was 14 is to 17 respectively. And the age of punit 9 years ago is same as the present age of Amit. So if another person sumit age is the average of present age of Amit and Punit. Then find the age of Sumit 5 years 6 months ago. So friends, I think after reading this question I can able to see three person Ahmed, Puneit and Sumit, right? But at last what we need to find here, we need to find what is the age of Sumit 5 years 6 months ago. So that is the most important area in this question. 5 year 6 months ago, right? That means you have to find after finding the present age of sumit you have to subtract from the value minus of 5.5 not 5.6 don't take it as 5.6 6 years because it is wrong actually you have to take it as 5.5 5 years 6 months so 6 months is what 6 months will be half of a year 6x2 which is 1 by2 1x2 is.5 take it as 5.5 years so friends understood or not don't take it as 5.6 if you have calculated as 5.6 six then the complete question will be the answer will be wrong. So now let me move on to the questions here. So this is the most important part. So now let me move on to the question. 9 years ago the ratio of Ahmed and Punit was 14 is to 17. So 9 years ago Ahmed will be 14x and the Punit will be 17X. Right? So that direct value has been given. So next point and the age of punit 9 years ago is same as the present age of Ahmed. So punit 9 years ago right? Let's take it as 17x minus of 9 9 years ago which is equals to the percentage of Amit. So which we can take it as 14x. So now 17x is equals to 9. So when you bring this 14 towards left hand side which is 3x. So this will be 3x is equals to 9. So x is equals to 3. So finally we got the value of x is equals to 3. Here based upon the second line of the question we found the value of x. So now just multiply here in order to find what what is their ages 9 years ago. Right? So 14 into 3. So 14 into 3 will be 42. So 42 will be the age of Ahmed. So similarly we can find the age of punit. So age of punit will be 51. So 51 year will be the age of Punit and the age of Ahmed will be 42. So now this is not the present age. So these two values are 9 years ago. So let's see what is their present age. So plus 9 because this value we have calculated 9 years ago. So after 9 years this becomes the present age of the person. So this will be 51 and this will be 60. So 51 and 60 will be the present age of Ahmed and Punet. So now according to the question what they are saying is if another person's sumit age is the average present age of Amit and Punit. Right? So there is a new person sumit whose age will be average present age of Amit and Punit. So 51 and 60. So when we calculated 60 + 51 resultant will be 101. So 1 divided by 2 because we need to find an average year. So 1 divided by 2 which will be like something around 5 2's are 10 right. So zero again 52s are 10 55 something 55.5 years right. So now what we need to find here is find the age of sumit 5 years 6 months ago. So just now I have told you 5 years 6 months ago 5 years 6 months you need to consider it as 5.5 years. So from 55.5 year you have to find what is the sumit age 5 years 6 months ago. So 5 years 6 months ago will be 5.5. So resultant will be 50 years. So friends understood or not how I have calculated right? So just remember one thing they are talking about there is a new person whose age will be average age of the person that is Amit and Punet already we have calculated 51 + 61 which is 111 11 divided by 2 will be 55.5 sorry I have written not one sorry 111 divided by 2 will be 55.5 so after finding 55.5 but what we need to find here is what is the age of the person sumit 5 years 6 months ago then you should not subtract 55.5 minus of 5.6. Don't do it. If you find like this your answer will be wrong. You should not calculate like 5.6. Take it as 5.5 because 6 months you have to consider it as.5 6 by 12 which will be.5. So finally answer for this question is 50 years. Next question. So 9 years ago. So the ratio of arsh and nishant was 5 is to8 and nishant age 9 years ago is same as the percentage of arsh. If a man's present age is 33.33%age of the present age of arsh and nishant then find the ammon's age 2 years ends. This concept question is exactly like what we solved in the previous question. Right? Previous question also the same concept. But here we need to find what is the 33.33% that is important. In many question you can able to see 33.33 66.66. So you need to find either directly or else convert into a fraction value that will be easy to solve. So let's solve this question. So 9 years ago the age of Arsh and Nishant. So we can say that ash age 9 years ago will be 5x and the nishant age 5 years ago will be 8x. So this is the ratio value what they have given. So we have considered the ash age and nishant age 9 years ago which will be 5x and 8x. So next point what they are saying is Nishant age 9 years ago. So Nishant age 9 years ago minus of 9 which is equals to the present age of ar right you can consider like 8x is equals to 5x + 9 you can write either way but our target is to find the value of x here. So we can easily say this will be 3x= 9. So x is equals to 3. So finally we got the value that is x= to 3 here. Substitute x is equals to 3 in ash and nishant so that we will get what are their ages 9 year back right so 5 into 3 will be 15 so 8 into 3 will be 24 so 24 and 15 were the ages of the person 9 years ago so let's find what is their present age just add 9 year resultant will be 24 so add 9 year 33 so 33 and 24 will be the present age of arch and nishant So now what is the third point they have said is if Ammon's present age there is a new person Ammons. So Ammon present age is 33.33%age of the present age of Arsh and Nishant. So Arsh and Nishant is how much? 33 + 24 which is 57. So 57 is the present age of both the person. But the person am's age will be 57 that is 33.33%age of both the person present age. So here you can't calculate what is 33.33% you can't able to multiply and find it out the answer. So the easy way is always to convert this fraction value that is percentage value in terms of fraction because 1x3 will be 33.33 it goes on. So we can say 57 into 1 by3. So this will be written as 19. So Ammon's age is 19. So now according to the question find the ammon's age 2 years ends. That means after 2 years right. So this is the present age of ammon. Now they are talking about we need to find what is the age of the ammon 2 years ends. Ends means after 2 years. So 19 + 2 resultant will be 21. So 21 will be the answer for this question and this is the most important part of the question right. So some values that are in a percentages it is easy if you convert into a fraction 66.66 33.33 44 something like we have some numbers right some fraction numbers which you can usually see in your exams. So make sure to convert the percentage value into a fraction and then try to calculate the answer. That will be the easy way. Even if you ask me like whether I can multiply and find yes you can but you will not get an exact answer. you will get an approximate answer like around 18 like that and then you can if you are like brilliant on solving it then you can go with the random options that two you will get the correct answer but not every time if you are solving little bit a difficult level question at that case you can't able to find an approximate value so you have to find an exact value so in that reason better learn these kind of percentage to fraction conversion third question so the ratio of age of ovia to coven is 5 is to 6. So coin age after 8 years is 100% higher than OIR 2 years ago. See most important point here. 100% higher. So every question I'm telling you some new stuff. Make sure to uh note down it while preparing for the exams. This will be definitely helpful. Right? So 100%. What is the meaning of it? 100%. That means you should consider it as 200%. So friends, understood or not? 100% higher. Already it is 100% again 100% higher. That means it it should be 200%. So now what they are saying is the ratio of age of OIA and Cavia sorry OIA and C is 5 is to 6. Let's take the person OIA age will be 5X and age will be 6X. So this is the value what they have given in the question. So now what they are saying is coin age after 8 years. So cav age is 6 years. So cav age after 8 years is 100% higher than oia is 100%. That means you have to consider it as 200% because usually okay let me talk about later on say 200% of o age 2 years ago. O age is how much? 5x 2 years ago minus of two. So friends understood or not? So if you write this equation correctly then solving the entire question is easy in profit and loss or in many topics we have seen it 100% more if you take if there is only word 100% we will calculate what is 100% of the number in case in the question if you see 100% more then you have to take it as 200% right already 100 is there but 100% extra that means total is 200%. So most important thing never forget this 100% higher that means it should be 200%. So now 6x + 8 is equals to 200 / 100 which is 2. So 5x - 2 right? So 6x + 8 is equ= to 10 x - 4. So 6x 10 x will be 4x 4 sorry it's 12. So x is equ= to 3. So finally we got the value that is x is equals to 3. So once we find the value of x now it is easy to find what is the both the person ages. So 5 into 3 will be 15. So 15 will be the ovia age and 6 into 3 will be 18. So 18 will the commence age. So now what we need to find here find the average present age of ovia and just we need to find an average. So 15 + 18 we have to divide by two. So that will be the answer for this question. Right? So the most important part in the question is this area. Right? So 100% higher. Make a note of it. Right? That's what I'm repeatedly saying. So in the previous question we have learned 33.33. I hope many students have already know that. So if you are learning first time make a note of it. So most of the percentage value in the problems on ages you have to convert into a fraction and then solving it will be really helpful. Right? And second is the uh 100% higher or 100%age more you have to consider it as 200%. If it is only 100%age age of cabin or age of then you have to write 100% year but they have mentioned the word 100% a year that means you have to take it as 200%. Next question. So if 4 years ago so the age of punit was half of the age of Santosh and after 4 years the age of punit is 40%age less than the that of Santosh then what is the ratio of present age of Santosh and Punit. So here our target is to find the ratio that two we need to find the present age ratio of both the person that is Santo and Punet. So what we can do here is if four years ago the age of punit was okay. So let's let's frame two equation because first they are talking about four years ago and next they are talking about after 4 years. So what we can do here is we can frame two equation from the present age. So let's take the punit present age as p and santo present age as x. So now the these are the present age of both the person. So now first point what they are saying is four years ago. So four years ago the age of punit. So four years ago that means P minus 4. So the age of Punet will be the half of the age of Santos right? So half of the age. So half of Santos S - 4. So let's frame this as equation number one. So this will be 2 P minus of 8 is equals to S - 4. So 2 P minus of S is equals to 4. So let's take it as equation number one. So similarly second point and after 4 years the age of punit right after 4 years the age of punit okay so punet is how much p + 4 so after 4 years the age of punit is 40% less so if it is 40% less then you can directly take it as 60% of santo's age so santo's age will be x + 4 because it is 40% less right so you you you don't want to calculate what is 40 and then you have you don't want to subtract it but we can directly calculate what is 60%age of Santo age which will be equals to punit age after 4 years. So now we can cancel these two values. So still we can cancel it on two table 3 and five. So 5 p + 20 is equals to 3 s + 12. So 5 p - of 3 s is equals to 12 - 20 minus of 8. So let's take it as equation number two. So now according to the question we have taken two equation. So now we need to solve it and we need to find the answer because our target is to find what is the present age of both the person right? Present age of Santosh and Punet. Okay. So let's solve this equation. So if you multiply the first equation by 3. So this becomes 6 P. So minus of 3S is equals to 12. So let's take the second equation as it is. So 5 p minus of 3x is equals to min - 8. So this will be minus plus and plus you can cancel these two value. So 6 p 5 p will be p. So 12 + 8 will be 20. So now we found the present age of the person. What is the name of punit right? Yes s punit will be 20. And now finding the second person santo should be easy. Just substituting any value p in this any of this equation. So if I substitute P equal to 20 here. So 20 into 2 will be 40 right. So 40 minus of S is equals to 4. So 40 - 4 which will be 36. So Santo's age will be 36. So according to the question our target is to find what is the ratio of so 36 is to 20. So 36 is to 20. So if you cancel it you will get the answer for this question. Right? So two important part in this question is every time when you look at the problems on ages question mostly if there are two different data has been given for the same two person right that is most important. So Santoshan Punet four years ago Santoshan Puneet four years after so they are talking about the same two person but in a different scenario. One is the past and second is the future. So in those cases what you need to do is you have to frame a equation for the first part. frame a separate equation for the second part. Frame a separate equation and then solve it to find the answer. Right? So this will be the answer for this question. Next question. So the sum of the present age of mother and daughter is 51 years. 6 years ago the mother age was 12 times the age of the daughter and the ratio of their age of mother and the father was 14 is to 15. So find the difference between the age of daughter and a father. So after reading this question I can able to see there are three person one is mother father and a daughter and look at the first two point of the question just now I have told you right if if they are talking about the same person in a different cases just look at the first point the sum of percentage of mother and her daughter first point they're talking about mother and daughter and second point also 6 years ago again they're talking about mother and daughter so now if you find these cases frame a equation that will be easy way to solve this question. So sum of the present age of mother and daughter which is 51 years. So what we can do is mother and daughter is equals to 51. What about the next point? 6 years ago. 6 years ago the mother age was 12 times the age of daughter 6 years ago. So we can consider it as m minus 6. So mother age 6 years ago is equals to 12 * the age of a daughter which is 6 years ago. D minus 6. So this will be m - 6 is equ= to 12d minus of 72. So m - 12d is equals to minus of 66. So let's take it as second equation. So first equation will be m + d is equal to 51 and second equation m - 12d is equals to minus of 66. So I think we can solve both the equation definitely we will get both the percentages. I think the solving this question is easy. So let's let's subtract first equation minus of second equation. So minus plus and plus we can cancel mother and mother here. So d and 12d will be 13d is equals to 6 117. Yes or no? Right? Yes 117. So d is equals to 9. That means the age of the daughter is equals to 9. So once you find the age of the daughter finding the age of the mother is easy because we already know that mother and daughter is 51. So now according to the question daughter is 9. So if daughter is 9 51 - 9 will be 42. So the age of the mother will be 42. Okay. So now we need to find what is the age of the father. So on the next point what they told here is the age of the mother and the father was 14 is to 15. So mother and father age will be 14 is to 15. And we already know that the mother age is how much? 42. So which is 14 part. So 14 part is equals to 42. So we need to find what is the 15 part that is father age. So we can cancel this will be three times. So x is equals to 45. So 45 will be the age of the father. So age of the father is 45. Age of the mother is 42 and age of the daughter is nine. So now according to the question our target is to find what is the difference. So difference between father and a daughter. So father and a daughter. So if we find a difference answer will be 36 years. So 36 years will be the age difference of a father and the daughter. Right? So easy question and you can solve this question in case if they're asking the prelims exam. Do not think how to solve it. Just remember the point if a same word same two person right concept is repeated twice in a two different line try to frame a equation and then solve a question first solve the equation so that you will get any one person age finding the next person age is also easy and then we can find all the remaining percentage based on the question. So remember this clue and make a note of it and if you see these kind of questions in your exams try to solve it first. Next question. So the age of a father before 18 years is 2 years more than 140%age of the present age of the son. So the ratio of age of father before 8 years to the present age of son is 2 is to1. Find the average of present age of father and son. Okay. So friends here our target is to find what is the average present age of father and son. And the first point they're talking about comparison and the second point they have given a direct ratio value which is 2 is to1. So father and the son where the ratio has been given 2 is to1. But read the question carefully. The father age 8 years ago right 8 years to the present age of the son is 2 is to1. That means this age two part is the father age which is 8 years ago and this is the present age of the son. So what we can do here is so let's take the present age of the father. So present age of the father will be 2x + 8. So friends understood or not because this two part is 8 years ago the father age. So bringing the past age to the present. So 2x + 8 resultant will be the present age of the father. So similarly where the son present age has been directly given. So present age of the son which is x. So this is the ratio value what they have given in the question. So now let me move to the first point of the question. The age of the father before 18 years. So present age of the father is 2x + 8. So now what they are saying is age of the father 18 years ago. That means 2x + 8 minus of 18. So age of the father 18 years ago is 2 years is 2 years right more than so 2 years more than 140%age of the percentage of the sun. So father age 18 years ago which is equals to 2 years more than 140 percentage which is 140 by 100 of the age of the present age of the sun. We have already considered the present age of the sun as x. So now I think we need to solve this to find the value of x. So we can cancel 0 0 here. So this will be 7 and this will be five. So here 2x - of 10 - of 2 is equals to 7x 5x. So 8 - 18 will be - 10. So while bring this two towards left hand side it becomes -2. So this will be 2x - of 12 is equ= to 7 by 5 of x. So I think we can take LCM here or multiply here. So which will be 10 x. So - of 60 is equals to 7 x. So 10 x and 7 x resultant will be 3x= to 60. So x is equals to 20. So finally we got the value x= to 20. That means the son present age. So present age of the son is 20. And what about the present age of the father? So 20 into 240. 40 + 8 will be 48. So 48 will be the present age of the father and 20 will be the present age of the son. So total will be 68. So 34 I think we need to find an average here. So present age average will be 34. So which will be the answer for this question right? So this part alone is important in the question. So make sure to solve many question based upon framing an equation like this. many many questions and when you look at all the previous year questions of IBBS exams or any bank exams like SBA clerk you can able to see this pattern questions usually you can see on the prelims exam like framing an equation or else framing two equation solving two equation to get values right like previous two question what we did and this is one single equation to solve it right so answer for this question is 34 years next question So 3 years ago, so the ratio of age of A to B was 3 to 4. So the present age of C is 33.33%age more than that of A. And the sum of the percentage of B and C together is 71 years. Find the difference between the percentage of A and B. So friends, here they are talking about three person A, B and C. But what we need to find here is we need to find what is the difference between the present age of A and B and there is a point here you can able to see 33.33 just now on the starting of the first I think first question of this video I've told it always if it is 33.33 66.66 66 there are some percentage value you can repeatedly see on problems on ages so take it as 1x3 so 33.33 should be consider it as 1x3 convert into fraction right so now let's solve this question so what they are saying is 3 years ago the ratio of ages of a to b is 3 is to 4 3 years ago so present age will be a will be 3x + 3 will be the present age of a and the present age of b will be 4x that means 4x + 3 because they have given 3 years ago. So we can say that + 3 + 3 resultant will be the present age of B and present age of A. So now what is the next point? The present age of C is 33.33%age more than that of A. So present age of C is 33.33%age more. That means what? Right? Always remember that if it is 23%age more we we take it as 123 percentage 40%age less we take it as 60%age because 100 is the base value right based upon this 100 if it is more we will add if it is less we will subtract here you can see they have given a word 33% more than that of a that means 133% of a so a's present age will be 3x + 3 so this will be the age present age of the person C and if it is 33.33% we know when you convert the value into fraction which is 1x3 now we take it as 133.33% how will you write it right 100 plus 33.33% yes so now this can be written as 100 will be 1 33.33 will be 1x3 so resultant will be 4x3 so this total 133.33 can be written - 4x3 into 3x + 3. So friends understood or not how I wrote it, right? So if it is only 33.33, right? We we take it as 1x3. But here it is 133.33%. So this can be written as 100 + 33 when you take a percentage outside. So this becomes 1 + 33.33. So 133.33 will be 1x3. So 4x3. So total 133.33% will be 4x3. So I have written 133.33 as 4x3 year into 3x + 3. So this will be the a's present age, b's present age and c present age. So now according to the question the present age of b and c together. So 4x + 3 plus 4x 3 into 3x + 3 is equals to the present age of b and c which is 71 years. So now it is easy to find what is the value of x year. If we solve it, we can easily get the value of x. So 4x + 3. So plus when you multiply this resultant will be 4x. 4x this will be like 4 is equ= to 71. So 4x 4x will be 8 x. So 4 + 3 will be 7 which is 64. So x is equals to 8. So finally we got the value that is x is equals to 8. So if we got the value of x, finding all the person is easy. Just substitute x here instead of here we in the first equation we will get what is the present age of a. So substitute x here we will get the percentage of b and we will get the percentage of c. So according to the question our target is to find what is the difference between a and b. Okay. So we need to find what is their difference. Just you can directly calculate the difference 3x 4x will be x which is equals to 8. So answer for this question is 8 years. So again the final answer part will always be easy. You can just like that go with mind calculation. So the first part is also easy just assuming what what age the persons are whether from the past to the present or from the future to the present we can frame that the the center part of the solution which is framing a equation. So that's what you need to practice more. So this is the area where you need to practice more and nowadays in the recent year exams where in the topic problems on ages the most of the numbers will be given in terms of percentages right so make sure to solve more and more number of question that is based on a percentage value right and then framing a equation and then framing a single equation so practice more number of questions and tomorrow I will be giving you test on the same topic problems on ages do not forget to take the test right so if you watch the video you will learn more concepts and go to my YouTube channel you will find many videos on problems on ages just watch all the videos and come and write the test only then you will get the practice without practice you can't able to clear the exam so watch learn be strong on the basic foundations and then start writing the test you will surely crack the exam so friends thank you so much for watching this video and if you really like it. Share the video to your friends, those who are preparing for the competitive exams. So, thank you so much.",unknown

And third important our first quantitative aptitude book. So just type interested and send to this WhatsApp number. Most probably we will release my first aptitude book this year. So after releasing the book we will notify you. Do not forget to purchase the book which will be very very important for this year and upcoming all the competitive exams. So friends, now let me move on to the special video for this year IBBS RRBPO and RRB clerk. So friends, now let me move on to the first video that is on the topic ratio and proportion for this year IBBS, RRBPO and RRB clerk. So here in this video I will be solving some of the important question for your exam and remember that I'm not going to teach you the basic level question. So if you don't know the basics kindly go to my YouTube channel. I have posted a separate video on ratio proportion starting from lesson number one. So these are the basics videos for your ratio proportion topic. So first learn the basics be strong on the basics and then come and watch this video because here I'm going to teach you the question level that are up for your IBBS RBPO and RRB clerk. So I'm not at all going to teach you the basics. So kindly learn the basics first and then come and watch this video. Right? And important thing do not forget to take the test tomorrow as I have mentioned in the first of this video. Right? study plan and then test. So do not forget to take the test. So so that you will get a practice that medium level question you will get a practice with the time management. So do not forget to write the test tomorrow. So now let me move on to the questions on the topic ratio and proportion. Here is the first question. So in a examination of a bank the number of passed candidates were five times the number of failed candidates. If there has been 40 less candidate appeared and 20 more candidates failed then the ratio of pass to fail candidate is 3 is to1. Then find the total number of candidates failed initially. So after reading this question I can able to understand one simple concept here. The question is based on past and the failed candidate. So if it is past and the failed candidates we have to know three things. the total number of candidate appeared and total number of past candidates and total number of failed candidates. So if we know all the three things solving the question is easy. So here our target is to find the failed candidates. So the first thing what we need to find here is total candidate, past candidate and fail candidate and then we can find the ratio value. Understood or not? Right? First understand the concept and think what we need to find and then proceed to solve the question. So first you can able to see let the failed candidate was not given in the question as well as what they are saying is the number of past candidates was five times the failed candidates they are comparing the past candidates with the failed candidates. So what we can do here is let's take the failed candidates as x and what about the past candidate will be 5x right five times yes or no right the number of past candidate was five times the failed candidates so let's take the past candidates as 5x and the failed candidates will be x so now according to the question you can able to see and and we can easily find the total candidate also why because if failed is x and pasted is 5x then we can Say the total candidates will be 5x + x which will be 6x. So 6x will be the total candidates and the past candidates and the failed candidates every value we found out right. So next thing they have given some other points here. The next point is if there are been 40 less candidate appeared. So what is the meaning of it 40 less candidates appeared. So from the total candidate now the 40 candidates less were appeared. So now we can say that appeared for the exams from the total candidate there were 40 less. So only I've subtracted here. What is the next point they are saying is if if there have been 40 less candidate appeared and 20 more candidates had failed. So now we already know that the failed candidate is X. So now according to the point what they are saying is 20 more candidates are failed. So the failed candidates those who appeared will be X + 20. So these are the failed candidates. So these are the total candidates appeared 6 minus 40. What is the next point they are saying is the ratio of pass to failed candidates becomes 3 is to1. So the ratio of past and the ratio of failed is 3 is to1. So now according to the question we know what is the failed candidate x + 20. Whether we know what is the past candidates. No we know that past candidate is 5x. So now according to the question what they have said is the the ratio of pass to fail candidate ratio is 3 is to1 so 3 is to1 failed candidate is one ratio passed candidate is three ratio but we don't know how much student have passed in the exam so how will you find it so just see here the total candidate who are appeared for the exams just think how we can find the past candidate from the total if you subtract the failed candidate the resultant will be the past candidate Right. So now according to the question we already know that the total appeared and the total number of who have less candidate from the total this much of candidate are not appeared for the exams. So the total appeared will be 6x - 40. Yes. So total minus of the failed candidates. So failed candidate is how much? X + 20. Right? So these are the total minus of the failed candidate. What about the resultant will be the past candidate. So 6x - x will be 5x. So -40 - 20 will be -60. So 5x - 60 out of total appeared. So this will be the past candidate. So now we got all the datas. So now according to the question the 3 is to1 ratio. So 3 is to1 ratio what they have given is for past and for the failed. We know fail is x + 20. So past just know we found 5x - 40. So 5x - of 60 divided by x + 20 is equals to 1x 3 is to 1 ratio. So 3x 1. So now cross multiply it. So 5x - 60 is equ= to 3x + 60. So 60 + 60 will be 120. So this will be 5x minus of 3x will be 2x. So 2x is equals to 120. So x is equals to 60. So finally we got the value of x is equals to 60. So now just check what we need to find here. So now what we need to find is find the total number of candidate failed initially. So initially is this much of candidates who are failed. So answer for this question is 60. Right? So friends understood or not they are not talking about after how much students appeared and then how much students failed. They are just asking initially. Initially we have assumed X is the total number of candidates who are failed. So friends sorry. So so now we found what is the total number of candidates who got failed in the examination. So friends understood or not? So there are the question looks very simple. Sorry friends. So I hope the question looks very simple but the thing is you have to understand the concept right. So read the question carefully. So first always decide what we need to find here in the question. So we know the failed we know the pass and we know the total but in the point what they are saying is the second point is the important in the question. If there had been 40 less candidate appeared actual appeared is 6x total. So now what they said is 40 candidates appeared less. That means the total now becomes 6x minus 40 and 20 more failed. Already we have fixed the failed candidate as X. But now what they are saying is 20 more candidates failed X + 20. So this is initial and this is the data what they have given in the question. So total minus failed candidate resultant will be the past candidate which is new. Right? So based upon this point we found the ratio 3 is to1 is already given in the question. So we applied the logic ratio logic here in order to find the value of x. So now they're asking what is the total number of failed candidate initially. So total number of failed candidate initially is 60. So friends understanding the question is important right? So solving will be very easy. So first you have to read the question. What we need to find here initially think about it and then solve the question you will feel really easy. Right? So this will be the answer for question number one. Second question. So the total population of a town A is 2x5th of the total population of town B and the ratio of total population of town A and C is 4 is to 7. If the total population of town A and C together is 150 more than that of town B then find the total population of town C. So after reading this question first thing what I strike in the mind is there are three town A, B and C. So whether they have given what is the total population or not. But what we need to find here is we need to know what is the total population of town A, town B and town C. If I find all the three values solving this question is easy. So first our target is always to find the total population of town A, town B and town C. And then based upon the question we can find all the remaining values. So now let me move on to the first point. So what they have said is the population of town A is 2x5th of the population of town B. So town A and town B they have comparing some population and second point the ratio of total population of town A and C is 4 is to 7. So they have given one ratio value that is A is to C which is 4 is to 7. So now we can easily take the total population of town A will be 4X and the total population of town C will be 7X. Yes or no? because the value what they have given is directly given in the question. So total population of town A will be 4X. Total population of town C will be 7X. So now the first point what they have mentioned is the total population of town A. So the total population of town A is 2x 5th of the total population of town B. So now we already know what is town A population. Town A population is how much? 4X. So 4x is equals to 2x 5 into town B total population. So once you cancel this this becomes town B population will be 10 X. So 10X is town B population. Town A population is 4X. Town C population is 7X. So now the first thing what I told you in the question is to find town A, town B, town C total population is we have found it. So town A, town C and town B. So now I think finding all the remaining value in the question will be easy. Why? Because they have given one point here. If the total population of town A and C is 150 more than that of town B that means the difference between A and C and B will be 150. So what they have given in the question is A and C difference of B is equals to 150. So friends understood or not whether it's more or whether it is less the meaning is the difference between what the data what they have given is 150 right so if I have 10 rupees and you have 20 rupees then what the question says is I have 10 rupees less than you that means the difference between both the amount what we have is difference is 10. So similarly what they have given is the total population of town A and C together is 150 more than that of town B. That means the difference between A and C when compared to B is 150. So that's what I've written here. So we already know that A and C A and C is how much? 7 + 11 7 + 4 which is 11 X difference of town B. So town B will be 10 X is equals to 150. So X is equals to 150. So finally we got the value of X is equals to 150. So let's see what we need to find here in the question. So our target is to find what is the total population of town C. So town C total population we already know that the total population of town C is 7 X and we know the value of X is equals to 150. So 1 5 0 is so 7 7 5 are 353 1050. So 1050 is the total population of town C. So similarly in case if they're asking what is the total population of town A or town B just substitute the value of X right so always remember that understanding the question takes time nowadays the recent year bank exams the level of the question is not at all easy it's like medium level so you have to practice this kind of question so that you can able to easily crack the exam that's why I'm repeatedly saying it do not forget to take the test that is most important here Right? So this will be the answer for question number two. So third question. So the ratio of expenditure to savings of Rajes is 2 is to 1 and 25%age of income of Nalu is equals to 40%age of income of Rajes. If the expenditure of Nalu is double the expenditure of Rajes, then the savings of Nalu is what percentage the savings of Rajes? So friends after reading this question I can able to understand one simple concept. There are two person one is Rajes and Nalu. So we need to find what is the person Rajes income and savings. Similarly the Nalu income and savings because our target is to find the savings of Nalu is what percentage the savings of Rajes. So we need to find the savings of both the person. So if we find that solving the question is easy. So now according to the question where the Rajes salary was not given here as well as the income of Nalu is also not given here but the major person here is the Rajes. Why? Because they have given the ratio of expenditure to the savings of Rajes is 2 is to1. So for the person Rajes they have given expenditure as well as savings. So now what I can do is I can fix the person Rajes monthly income or salary right. So which which will be 100x let's fix like this. So the income of Rajes will be 100x. So now according to the question what they are saying is now like next let we find what is the income of Nalu. So 25%age income of Nalu right. So 25%age the income of Nalu. We don't know what is the income of Nalu but 25%age of income of Nalu which is equals to 40%age the income of Rajes. So friends understood or not? This is the point what they have given in the question. Second point, so 25%age of income of Nalu which will be equal to 40%age the income of Rajes. So 40%age income of Rajes is equals to 20%age income of Nalu. So by using this point we can easily find what is the income of Nalu right? So we can cancel percentage percentage here. So similarly we can cancel this one times. So this will be four times. So 4 fours are 6 160. So income of nalu will be 160x. So income of nalu is 160x and income of rajes will be 11x. So now we found the income of both the person. So next target we need to find the savings and here they have given one important point expenditure. So everyone knows it. So income minus of expenditure is equals to savings. So now according to the question the expenditure and the savings are in a ratio 2 is to1 that is for the person Rajes. So now the finding expenditure is easy here. What is the expenditure for the person Rajes? So is income is how much 100x and the expenditure ratio what they have given is 2 divided by total three. Yes or no? Right. So the expenditure and savings ratio what they have given is 2 is to1 and income of Rajes is 100x 100x into the expenditure two part the total will be three part. So now once you cancel this 200x divided by three which is called as an expenditure. So expenditure of Rajes and what about the savings ratio? So savings ratio of Rajes what they have given us two same 2 is to1 ratio and we know the savings is one part. So we can say that the savings of Rajes will be 100x into 1 divided by 3. So which is 100x divided by 3. So 100x divided by 3 will be the savings of Rajes and expenditure of Rajes will be 200 minus X and the income of Rajes will be 100X. So now Nalu income is 160X. What about the next point they have given in the question is if the expenditure of the Nalu is double the expenditure of the Rajes. So expenditure of Nalu is double the expenditure of Rajes. And already we know that Rajes expenditure is 200x divided by 3. So now according to the question Nalu expenditure is twice which means into 2. So Nalu expenditure will be 200 into 2 which is 400x / 3. So 400x divided by 3 will be the nalu expenditure and nalu income is 160x. So how will you find the savings of nalu? Just now I have told you right income minus of expenditure resultant will be savings. So income is 160x minus of expenditure 400x divided by 3 resultant will be the savings of nalu. So once you multiply the 0 181 480 480x - 400x total divided by 3. So 80x divided by 3. So which will be the savings of nalu. So now we found the savings of nalu which is 80x / 3 and we know the savings of rajes which is 100x divided by 3. So now finding the answer is very simple right. So because we need to find the savings of Nalu is what percentage savings of Rajes just X by Y. So substitute and find the answer right. So savings of Nalu. Savings of Nalu will be 80 X divided by 3 divided by so Rajes savings which is 100 X divided by 3 into 100. So we can cancel 3 and 3 X and X 100 and 100. So answer will be 80%. So answer for this question that is third question which is 80%age right. So friends solving the question is very simple and for understanding I have written all the things step by step but in your exams you should not write all the values like this just calculate in the mind if the Rajes total income is 100x it's is expenditure ratio will be just calculate in the mind 100 into 2 divided by 3. So 200 by 3 and what about the savings 100 into 1 divided by 3 100 by 3. So directly try to write all the steps right. So don't write all these steps. It's unnecessary thing. You can just calculate in the mind itself. Just to understand how I'm solving this question. I'm writing all these steps while practicing while writing the test. Kindly do not write all these steps. It's completely time waste. Try to calculate some of the values in the mind. only then you can able to solve the question little bit faster right so answer for this question is 80% question number four so the income of gokiller is 25% less than the street less than that of shri right so and the expenditure of gokiller is 12.5%age more than that of the savings of shri and gokila is 6,000 and 3,000 respectively find the expenditure of the gokill So here it is similar to the previous question right but the concept is different because here they are talking about two person one is gokiller and second person is three and both the person they have given some values that is you see 25%age less than they have given a income so first point they are comparing both the person income and the second point they are comparing both the person expenditure as well as savings value is also given we already know one simple logic income minus of expenditure is equals to savings. So here according to the question all the values are directly given just see what they saying is the income of gokila. So let's fix gokila and shri right. So the income let's let's talk about the income ratio. So income ratio what they are saying is income of gokila is 25% less than shri. So now what we can do is we can take 100 as shri. What about gokila? 25%age less which will be 75. So now we can say that the income ratio will be 3 is to 4 yes or no because 25%age less. So 100 minus 25 resultant will be 75. So 75%age will be the gokill income and the shri income will be 100. So after cancelelling it so now we got the ratio 3 is to4. So this will be the income ratio. So now let me move on to the second point what they talking about the expenditure. So now according to the question what is the expenditure they're talking about is 12.5%age more than that of Shri right. So now the expenditure ratio of Gokilla and Shri which is 12.5%age more than Shri. So let's take Shri as 100. So what about gokila 100 + 12.5 which is 112.5% because that's the point they have given 12.5% more. So once you cancel this divide by uh 10 remove the decimal point divide by 10 multiply by 10 here this becomes 1,000 this becomes 1125. So this will be 8 times and 9 times right. So 9 is to 8. So 9 is to 8 will be the ratio of expenditure and they have given the value of the savings which is 6,000 and 3,000 respectively. Savings value is directly given and just now I have told you income minus expenditure. So income let's take the gula income as 3x what about our expenditure which is 9x. So income minus of expenditure which is equals to savings. So savings value what they have given in the question which is 6,000. For the second person, Gokila is 6,000 and sorry, Shri will be 6,000. Gokila will be 3,000. So this will be Gokila which is 3,000. So this will be the first point and similarly we can move to the second point. Second point is Shri. So Shri income will be 4x expenditure will be 8 Y which is equals to their savings. So savings will be 6,000. This will be point number two. Now I I hope everyone can solve this easily. just multiply and try to cancel out any of the value and our target is to find x and y. So now according to the question find the expenditure of goila. So our target is to find the expenditure that means we have to find the y value. Yes. So once you find the y value we can find easily find what is the goila or the three expenditure. So now we have to cancel x. If if we have to cancel x just multiply the first equation by four and second equation by three. So once you multiply the second equation by 4 which is 12x - of 36 y is equals to 12,000. So similarly second equation by 3. So 12x - 24 y is equals to 18,000. Yes. Now we can cancel it. So minus plus minus cancel this. So now this becomes 36 and 24 which will be 12 y. So minus of 12 y is equals to 12,000 - 18,000 will be minus of 6,000. So we can cancel this and this. So y will be 5,000. Yes. So now we got the value of y. So once we get got the value of y solving the question is easy. Why? Because our target is to find what is the value of the expenditure of goila. So goila expenditure is how much? 9 and y. So y is how much? 500. So once you multiply these two value resultant will be the expenditure of kilula right. So friends all I think I have taught you this lesson separately in ratio proportion income minus expenditure that is most important right. So income minus expenditure is equals to savings. I have separately thought this concept because ratio proportion this concept income and expenditure plays a major role. So do not forget to learn the basics of income expenditure. If some some in some question for some person the income will not be given. So for that we have to assume it as 100x. So once you fix the income as 100x solving the question is easy. Do not fix as 1,000 or 500. So that becomes the calculation part will be more. So try to fix it as 100x and solve the question. Next question. So the ratio of total number of male and female in a company is 4 is to 5. If 18 employees resigned from the company and 12 new male employees and 10 new female employees join the company so that the ratio becomes 14 is to 15. So find the initial number of employees in the company. So when just listen here I think after reading this question I can able to understand one concept they're talking about the total number of employees in a company where male and female has been given 4 is to 5 from the total where 18 employees resigned 18 is they have given total we don't know how much male and how much female so but total 18 employees left the company and then 12 men joined and then 10 new women joined and the ratio becomes 14 is to 15 right and then By based upon this data our target is to find what is the total number of employees in the company initially. That means the ratio value what they have given is 4 is to 5. So 4x will be male and 5x will be female. Yes or no? Because they have given the direct value. Male is to female ratio which is 4 is to 5. So now let's fix the male will be 4x and what about the female? Female will be 5x. So now according to the question where 18 employees resigned the company, right? So we don't know how much inside this 18 how much male and how much female they have given total 18 employees resigned the company. So let's find out of this 18 how much female and how much male. So now what we can do here is we already know that 4x will be the total number of employees of male employees right so total number of male employees is 4x out of this 18 employees got resigned right and out of this 18 we don't know how much male and how much female so let's find how much male here so 4x is the total male minus of 18 into so male will be four total will be five so friends understood or not so four will be male 5 + 4 9 will be total. So now addition how many new male employees join the company? So 12 new male employees join the company. So divided by similarly write for the female. So 5x will be the total number of female employees. So minus of 18 will be the total number of employees who resign the company. 18 into 5 by 9. We don't know out of this total we have to find how many female. We know male and female is four is to 5. So 5 divided by 9 into 18 resultant will be out of this 18 how many female employees in the company. So now how many female employees newly joined? So total 10. So now because of this the ratio becomes 14 is to 15 that is 14 by 15. So friends understood or not how I wrote in a single equation. If you write this you can also find separately. If you if you feel like this is confusing part you can able to find this separately out of this total 18 how many male and how many female. So 18 into 4 by 9. So 18 into 5 by 9 is you can calculate it separately but make sure to calculate the values faster. So once you write it in a single step solving will be very simple right we can cancel this will be 2 * so 4 into 2 will be 8. So minus of 8 + 12 will be four. You can write it on a single step itself or no. So that's the reason I'm saying it's your wish completely right. So this will be 9 into 28 5 into 2 will be 10. So - 10 + 10 will be 0. Resultant will be 5x is equals to 14 / 15. So we can cancel this also. 1 5 are 5 5 3's are 15. So multiply this. So this will be 12 x and this will be 12 is equals to 1. So 14x. So once you bring this 2x x= to 6. So finally we got the answer the value that is x is equals to six. So now according to the question what we need to find here is find the initial number of employees in the company. That means the total employees. So initially we know the male will be 4x female female will be 5x. So 5x + 4x is 9x. So 9x is the total number of employees initially and we got x is equals to 6 here. So 9 and 6 are 54. So 54 is the total employees in the company. Right? So this is the way we have to find the answer for this question. You can calculate the value separately. But make sure to write everything in a single step so that you can save the time in your exams. That's the reason I'm saying it's it's completely upon your wish. If you are speed and calculation, you can calculate separately also. But the concept is most important. Why we are separating and why we are adding that is most important here. Next question. So in a company ratio of male to female employee is 7 is to3 and the monthly salary of male employee is 60%age of the total number of employees and monthly salary of female employee is 90%age of male employee. So if the total salary of male and the female employee is 5 lakh 52 lakh 38,000 yes 38,000 then find the number of employees in the company. So friends our target after reading this question I can able to see it's based upon the employees male and the female employees and our target is to find what is the total number of employees in the company. So they have given the salary of the employee these are the datas they have given. So when listen here in the first point itself they have given two value male is to female ratio is see the ratio of male and female employee is 7 is to3. So they have given the value directly that is male is to female is equals to 7 is to 3. So let's easily we can assume that the male total number of male employees will be 7x and total number of female employees will be 3x. I at last I will say many students where usually they will make a mistake in this question. I will say at the last rate because I've seen okay let's talk about that later on. So now according to the question they have given the total number of male and total number of female ratio which is 7 is to 3. So we have assumed it as 7x and 3x. Next point and the monthly salary of male employee is 60%age of total number of employees. See male employee salary. So male employee salary will be 60%age of total number of employees. Right? So we already know that 7 x and 3x so male and female so 7 x + 3x will be 10 x. So 10 x will be the total number of employees and 60%age is the men's salary alone is 60%age of total number of employees. Right? So when you calculate 60%age of 10 so we can cancel percentage and two 0. So resultant will be 6x. So 6x will be the total number of salary of the person men's right men male employee in a company. So now let me move on to the third point female employees. So 90% see and the monthly salary of a female employee is 90%age salary of a male employee. So 90%age of male employee right. So female salary is 90%age of male employees. See whether it's a male employee or male employee salary is salary salary of male employee. We found the salary of male employee is 6x. So multiply 6x here. Do not write 7x here. Why? Because usually students make a mistake at this point. They think the total number of male employees. No, they are not talking about the male employee. 90%age salary of male employee that is important here. So do not write 7x write 6x what we calculated in the previous iteration. Right? So 90 percentage of 6x. So 9 6 are 54. So 54 by 10 which is 5.4. So 5.4x. So 5.4x will be the salary of the female. And the male salary is 6x. So now according to the question the total number of employee salary has been given something around 52 lakh something right. How will you find it? We know the total number of male is how much? 7x. And we know the value 6x will be the salary of the male. So 7 x + 6x so plus female. So total number of female is 3x into and the salary of the female will be 5.4x is equals to some amount they have given here. Let let let me find this value initially and then we can find out what is the value they have given at the last 52 lakh 38,000 just a moment. 52 lakh okay so 52 lakh 38,000 52 lakh 38,000 whether it's 50 just a moment I can check the question okay okay okay 52 lakh okay so let let's let's find the answer so 42x right so 42 x² + 4 3's are 12 remainder will be 1 151 16 so 16.2x 2x² is equals to 52 lakh 38,000. Right? So once you add this 2 so 6 + 8 4 + 1 will be 5. So 58.2x² is equals to 52 lakh 38,000. Okay. So again 582x² is equals to 52 38 0 0. Right? And what I did is I have just removed the decimal point here divided by 10 and multiplied in the right hand side add another zero. So now we need to cancel and we need to find the answer. Just listen carefully. Here the last number is two. Here the last number is 8. So the multiples of two which comes the last number 8 is 9. 9 into 2 is 18. So let's let's find whether we can multiply this by 9. So 9 into 2 will be 18 1. So 73 7 9 5 are 45. So 45 52. So we can say that this complete term we can cancel it on 9. So x² is equals to 1 2 3 4 0. So x is equals to 3 1 2 0. So finally we found the value of x which is 300. So once we find the value of x finding all the remaining value will be simple. So according to the question what is our target? We need to find the number of employees in the company. That means we need to find the total employees. So 7 x and 3x will be 10 x which will be the total number of employee and x we found which is 300. So answer for this question is 3,000. So 3,000 will be the total number of employees in a company. Yes. So I have seen many students usually uh they fix a value in a different way. Usually I've seen students will be solving ratio and proportion question in a different different way. For example, uh two question back I have fixed the total number of male as 100 x right but some students what they usually do is they fix it as 10 x and some students without x they fix as 500 a random number kindly don't do that do not fix any random number for example instead of 7 you can fix it as 7x but don't fix it as 700 and solve a question so friends understood or not it is 7 multip multiple it will be three multiple that is the meaning of it right so male and female ratio will be 7 is to 3 whatever the number be when once you cancel it it becomes 7 is to 3 that's what ratio actually value says but while fixing male take it as 7x right but do not take it a random number as 700 and 300 don't do it I've seen many students what they usually do they take male as 700 and female as 300 and they try to start solving a question at some point you will struggle to find the answer. So kindly don't do it. Have some certain values. If they have given a value in terms of ratio, fix as it is. If the value was not given in the question, fix it as 100x and then solve a question. Right? In a percentage topic, we usually fix any for example monthly salary. In percentage topic, I'm saying quantitative aptitude percentage topic. In the in the topic, mostly we fix 100%age as the base value. In ratio proportion try to fix it as 100x as a base value and then try to solve a question. Do not fix any random number. If you fix random number you will get the answer but at some point you have to assume some cases inside the equation and then we have to solve it. So if you are brilliant on it you can go with that method or else better do not fix any random number. If they have given 7 is to 3 take it as 7x and 3x. If they have given the ratio 4 is to 1, take it as 4x and x. That's the right way you will solve the question so that you will get the answer correctly. Right? So now answer for this question is 3,000. Next question. So a man ordered four pair of black socks and some pair of brown socks. So the pair of black socks is double that of brown pair. While preparing the bill, the clerk interchanged the number of black and brown pair by the mistake which is increased by 50%age. So the ratio of number of black and a brown pair of socks is originally ordered was right. So very important question this concept right the concept that used to solve in this question you can able to see more on some data interpretation for solving tough level data inter I've seen a cookies based question which was asked in 2019 or 20 I don't know exactly but it was on some uh exam it was DI that was applied in the same logic right so there are two cookies one is chocolate cookies and another is strawberry Strawberry cookies. So what usually they do is they interchange the bill and then some value will be given. So we have to actually change the complete DA into a correct bill and then we have to solve a question. Similar concept, right? So first let's understand the simple logic here what they are saying. A man ordered four pair of black socks. So totally there are two socks. One is a black and second is a brown. Right? So now let's take what is the original amount and then we can say because of interchanging the bill right interchanging the socks bill let's take what is the new bill that came right so now just listen carefully a man ordered four pair of black socks so he ordered four pair of black socks right and some pair of brown socks so here the black socks value has been directly given but brown socks value was not directly given let let me take it as brown socks as x and the black socks will be four. According to the question, the price of pair of black socks is double that of brown. So in case if the brown rupee is 1 rupee, for example, a pair of brown socks is 1 rupee, then black socks will be two. Yes. So this will be the pair of socks and this will be the price. So now we can easily find the pair into price. So for example, if I purchase four pair, so each pair is 2 rupee. So 4 into 2 will be 8. But we don't know what about the brown how many brown socks the person has bought. So x into 1 will be x. So what is this x + 8? So x + 8 will be actually the original bill. Yes or no? So this will be the original bill has to be generated. But because of a mistake what the person has did is while preparing the bill the clerk interchange the number of black and brown socks. Right? So now what we can do is this is actually the original bill and now interchanged bill that means a new bill right so here black is four brown is x because of interchanged so the person will assume x as black and the four as brown so now let me talk about the price will not interchange knows the price so for the black and brown the price will be same the price remains constant only thing is he interchange the black and brown right socks alone so now let's multiply This will be 2x and this will be four. So 2x + 4 is what? New bill. Because of interchanging the black and the brown socks, the new bill will be 2x4. Old bill is what? X + 8. So now because of interchanging how much price has been increased increased by the bill which is 50%. Just see the new bill price right is just equals to 1.5 times the old bill. Yes or no? So means understood or not how I wrote this 1.5 the old bill because they have clearly mentioned that the new bill is equals to old bill compared to old bill it is 50%age more that means 150%. So 150%age of the old bill which will be resultant to the new bill. So now we already know all the value substitute here and find out the answer. So 150 is if if it is 50%age increase 150 by 100 when you cancel it on five table resultant will be 3x2. So multiply by 3x2 and find out the answer. Right? So oldable 3x2. So which is 3 into 8 + x. So this will be 2 * 2x + 4. So 4x + 8 is equ= to 24 + 3x. So we can cancel 4x and 3x will be x. So 24 - 8. So 24 - 8 will be 16. So finally we got the value of x is equals to 16. So now according to the question our target is to find the ratio of number of black and a brown pair of socks in in the original order. Original order means this is the original order. Right? So now we know the black what he ordered is four. What about the brown socks? X we found out 16. So four and 16. So four and 16 will be the ratio. Once you cancel it which will be 1 is to 4. So 1 is to 4 is the answer for this question. So friends most most important concept right the question concept that we applied here to solve the question the concept is more important because recent year in many data interpretation that is based on ratio proportion like mistaken value has been taken those kind of concept question we have to solve like this so even if you don't know how to solve the question or you are struggling you are making mistakes somewhere else while solving it. That is not at all a problem that you will get after solving five or 10 question automatically you will get that you won't make a mistake. But if you don't know the concept you can't able to solve the question. So try to understand the concept clearcut concept is important only then you can able to solve the tough level question like mains exams right. So try to understand this concept and if you are a separate note for if you are preparing for this year exam if you are a separate note make sure to note out this question and uh this concept or more important for the exam right so answer for this question the ratio which is 1 is to4 next question so A B and C are the partners of a company so during a particular year A received one/ird of the profit B received 1/4 of the profit and C rece received the remaining 5,000 how much did A receive? So you can able to see these kind of questions more on prelims level exam right like the share share based question even in partnership topic you can able to see such a questions right so what they saying is there are three partners A B and C in a business so during a particular year A receives one/ird of the profit actually the profit was not given so let's let's assume it as X so X will be the profit right out of this profit how much A receives A receives one/ird of the profit so A is equals to xx3. So similarly the second person B receives 1/4 of the profit. So B is equals to XX4. And what about the person C? So person C receives rupees 5,000. Yes. And look at the word carefully before this 5,000 remaining rupees 5,000. That is important here. If they have given directly like C receives 5,000 that is different but here they have given C receives profit remaining 5,000 that means from the total right from the total that is X total profit X minus of A and minus of B resultant is equal to C. Friends understood this law or not right because from the total profit where A is getting some profit B is getting some profit. The remaining profit that was given to C. So that C amount is 5,000. So this amount will be equals to 5,000. Right? So now let's solve this. X X3 minus of XX 4 is equals to 5,000. So we can say 4 3's are 12. So 12x - 4x - 3x / 12 is equals to 5,000. So this will be 4 and 3 will be 7. So 3 5x. So 5x / 12 is equals to 5,000. So we can cancel it which will be 1,000. 1,000 into 12 will be 12,000. So 12,000 is the value of x. That means the total profit. So total profit of the business which is 12,000. So now according to the question, how much did a receives? So a how much did receive were x by 3. Already we got x is equals to 12. 12k which is 12,000. 12,000 divided by 3 will be 4,000. So similarly we can find for B as well as we can find for C. So all the three person we can easily find out right. So finding out is easy right? But the this concept right the concept you can able to see more on profit sorry partnership as well as in many prelims exam based you can question you can able to see these kind of question. So which is the answer for this question right. So friends here in this video I have solved many different concept question on the topic ratio and proportion. So do not forget to practice the test right in the same aptitude reasoning test package I have given a test on ratio proportion particularly for IBS RBPO and RRB clerk. So do not forget to take the test right and then uh once after releasing the book I will notify you and do not forget to buy the book also which is more and more helpful for your upcoming exams. So friends thank you so much for watching this video. See you on the next video. Bye.",unknown
APRfbJ0ihVI,"First of all, thanks for being here in my YouTube channel. So friends, I hope you have seen the thumbnail of the video. So first time a steady plan for this year IBBS RRBPO and for RRB clerk. So actually I was planning to go with two different steady plan. So one plan is for RRB PO and clerk and another plan that will be starting in the month of August end that is for IBS PO and IBS clerk. So why? Because when we look at all the previous year question papers 3 to four years the IBBS RRB PO clerk standard is little bit uh like average level but when we look into IBS clerk and IBBS PO so every year they are increasing the quality of the question. So we have to study IBBS clerk and IBBS PO differently and RRBPO and RRB clerk differently. So here is the steady plan. I will tell you how to download the steady plan and where is the test series and by using a coupon code you can just buy it for only 99 rupees and then my first quantitative aptitude book right so thank you so much again after releasing I will tell you definitely so it's in the printing process right now so the final stage okay so so let me talk about the steady plan so here is the steady plan I have targeted for the 3 months starting from this month 27th So I will be starting with the first topic of ratio and proportion and where I will be teaching for exactly what level that was required for RRBPO and RRB clerk. For that same level I will be teaching you each and every topic on quantitative aptitude as well as in reasoning. So after teaching every topic on the next day you will have a test on the same topic. So the test will be on aptitude and reasoning test package. I hope most of the students have already bought it. So you don't want to buy any other test on my platform. So if you already bought the test series of aptitude and reasoning inside that from 27th you can able to see a new tab called IBBS 2025 26. So inside that I will be giving you all the test. So do not buy any other test if you already bought aptitude and reasoning. If you have planned to buy just use the coupon code first buy so that you can able to purchase the test only for 99 rupees. Both aptitude and reasoning combined package you can buy it only for 99. So do not forget to use the code right. So this is the plan what I actually plan to go with this year IBBS PO and the clerk. So similarly next next topic after teaching one topic on next day itself you will have a test on the same topic what I thought yesterday right and from the next month I will be giving you the full length prelims practice it so where you can able see able to see totally I plan for 10 test so each test with a different level so first five test will be of easy level and then little bit of medium level and then hard level so that if you practice all the three different kinds of fulllength prelims practice it that will be helpful for your exams right so that's the reason so in the chart you can able to see a star-l like image that was mentioned on some of the dates so on all those dates you will get a prelims full length prelims test right so and then uh if you click for example in the PDF file if you click on any of the topic for example if you click the ratio proportion topic it will be redirected to the ratio proportion playlist what I have already posted on my channel for example if If you find difficult to search the lessons on my YouTube channel, it this PDF file will be definitely useful. For example, if you click on the simple interest, it will be redirected to the playlist of the simple interest what I have already posted on my channel. So that before watching all the videos where you can able to see the list of videos that was already posted on my channel. So once you revise it and then definitely those videos that I'm planning for the IBBSPO and RBP on the clock will be very helpful right and then the test already inside the aptitude test package you will have all the topic list right for example uh time and work time and distance simple interest component interest so inside that I have given four or five test so already all the test will be inside aptitude and reasoning test package so now inside the same test package I will be giving you a test for RBPU and RRB clerk. Why? Because you need the question exactly what level the exams were asking because I have seen most of the students still studying a very easy level question and they are not targeting that medium level and hard level. So what I planned is to go with lot of medium level question so that if you are preparing for RBP and clerk or IBBSP and clerk definitely these videos the what I'm going to post and the test series what I have given on this platform will be definitely useful. So that is my plan for this year IBBS RBP and RRB clerk. So you can download the PDF study planner on the description page. So once after downloading it start following all the videos and start writing the test on the next day that is most important do not dump all the test at the last so you can't able to uh practice like that. So every day start you are practicing and I think you have 2 3 days of gap so that on the time study English study other sessions right just you are going to watch my videos only for 1 hour one and a half hours after that you have lot of time so you start preparing English or start watching aptitude videos on some other YouTube channels right but you have to be like 5 to 6 hours daily spend for this year bank exam surely you can able to crack it right and then my first quantitative ive aptitude book. So it's in the final stage. So and many students were asking about it. In case if you are interested, right? So just do one thing. I will give you my WhatsApp number. Just say only interested. Just type interested and send. So you you will be notified once after releasing our first aptitude book and the pre-registered students you can buy the aptitude test with very very low cost. Actually I I have planned to uh launch the book at very low cost first time because it's my first book and I put much hard work here like three to four years of hard work. So how the book should be and where the formula should be and what kind of questions that exactly students need to practice before going for the exam and I have like sit and analyze the complete each and every topic every exams. So it takes much time. So I just prepared that complete book. Everything is completed. I think most probably within 2 weeks or uh 10 days I will be uh launching my book. So in case if you want to buy it with uh uh offer pre-registered offer do not forget to say interested send to this WhatsApp number once after releasing my first book you guys will be notified first students those who WhatsApp us right. So where you can able to buy with minimum cost very very low cost the book will be right. So friends, thank you so much for watching this video and follow the study plan. Start your preparation. Do not wait for the exams because already the exam calendar was released. IBBS PO and the clerk will be in the month of I think December. And uh this exam RRB, PO and RRB clerk will be on 27th July. So everything was already released on IBS calendar itself. So start your preparation surely you can able to crack the exam, right? So friends, thank you so much for watching this video and do not forget to WhatsApp us, right? So thank you so much.",unknown
dwGq9Dqp9yI,"So friends, first of all, thanks for being here in my YouTube channel. So this video will be regarding IBBS exam 2025 exam this year. So I hope you have seen the notification. Notification was released in the month of Jan itself. So usually you have to start your preparation only from this month that is mainly the current affairs. So usually if you are preparing for IBS clerk or IBBS PO so the exams will be on uh October or November month September October like that but the mains will be on the December and January. So most probably they cover 6 months current affairs that is from the month of March. So this is the right time where you can start your preparation for the current affairs. So from this month start preparing current affairs daily. So do not learn the current affairs at the end. You can't able to prepare like that. So I've seen many students preparing by using a capsule only 1 month before the exam. So don't do it. Nowadays it is not possible. So make sure to start your preparation on the current affairs from this month itself. Right? And I'm really sorry for not posting the videos for uh 2 weeks because I was little bit quite little bit busy on my first aptitude book quantitative aptitude book that will be released soon. So I think expecting on next month the first or second week. So probably I will be uh launching the first book on the month of April. So thank you so much all for your great support. So now entering into the video for this year IBBS exam. So friends remember that every year the exam level is keep on increasing right the level of the exam. So if you are preparing for IBS clerk or any bank exam this year, make sure to learn the fundamentals basic fundamentals strong and then go stepby-step process and learn tough level questions more and if you if you want to learn more level of tough level questions then go for some CAT level exam question papers previous year CAT exam question papers, UPSC exam question papers. So refer all those exam question papers so that you can get an idea how the mains level question papers will be and for the prelims exam my channel is more than enough because I have covered all the quantitative aptitude topics starting from lesson number one. So complete concept lessons are there in each and every topic on quantitative aptitude as well as in reasoning and I have a separate series for the mains. So I have started from the previous year the mains data interpretation mains seating level arrangement and then recently I have started a series on mains topic wise series starting from problems on ages four video simple interest component interest four video so those videos will be for the mains exam if you are preparing for even cat or preparing for any bank level mains exam you can utilize the video right and then uh the most rated test series or feel free to learn that Aptitude and reasoning test. So do not forget to purchase the test. I will give you one code which you can buy the test that is on both aptitude and reasoning for this year only for 99. So we have given this coupon code for 10,000 students. So 10,000 students can use the coupon code only. You can get the both aptitude and reasoning for 99 rupees. So do not forget to use this code anytime. But we have targeted 10,000 students only 99 rupees right one year validity you can write all the test inside the test package multiple times and y number of times till the exam right so so friends ne next important thing what I need to uh say is uh many students usually ask me like how the speed comes I have prepared I'm like prepared all the quantitative aptitude topic but I'm not getting that speed. So friends listen here if you take SBI or IBS exam most probably the preliminence exam question papers nowadays it is not so difficult as well as not so easy it is like medium level question for a medium level question it is enough to solve one question within 1 minute 15 seconds or 1 minute you don't want to crack just like that in 30 seconds that is not possible but you can surely crack the question within one or one and a half minute so take your time right don't be too fast to solve a question those things are not needed nowadays prelims exam accuracy is more important than time management right you have to so not time management I'm I'm saying like the fast the way that you are solving a question faster I have seen many students target that they have to solve a question within 30 seconds 40 seconds so that they make a mistake so I usually say this to many of the students accuracy should be your first target Right? The question even if you are taking 45 seconds or 1 minute that is not a problem but accuracy is more than important than time management. Right? Because I've seen many students usually they want to solve a question within 30 seconds but they make a mistake after solving a question in 30 seconds. They found that they they have done some mistakes in it. So it takes another 30 seconds to solve a question. But students those who manage the time properly they won't use any shortcut they won't any they won't use any faster techniques a normal traditional method a students can able to solve within 45 seconds so target like that so keep on solve daily basis medium level question do not target very easy level question for the prelims exam target medium level question and for the mains exam time management or not at all needed right for The mains exam the only thing what you need is the concept you have to understand the question and you have to solve the question right that's it so for the mains time management speed nothing is important for the prelims again accuracy is more important than the speed keep that in mind right so friends and I I I was like planning to post videos for this year bank exam more and then I will be targeting SSC CGL this year and then my first book will be launched on the next month. So once I after publishing my book I will surely uh notify you and I will notify in the mobile application too. So uh and finally all the best start your preparation do not wait for the exam like don't prepare one or two months before the exam start now itself daily basis start the current affairs preparation and daily basis start learning aptitude and every day at least practice 10 or 20 questions. Right? so that you can surely crack the bank exam and main important thing do not forget to purchase the test only for 10,000 students you can use this coupon code I've given the coupon code here use this coupon code for first 10,000 students you can get both aptitude and reasoning only for 99 right so after 10,000 students kindly please don't ask me because this is like every year we usually do this so this is the thing what I need to say in this video and from this week I will be start posting the videos for IBBS 2025. So friends, thank you so much and those who are going for SBI mains and SBIP PO mains, all the best. Do well, right? So friends, thank you so much uh and love you a lot. Thank you. Fight.",unknown
3XT6WRqLjig,"so friends this series is specially made for the bank exam aspirants those who are going for the mains exam like SBO Mains ibbs Mains RBA Mains so for those students as well as for students those who are preparing for the cat exams so this series is specially made for you and second importantly after watching this video do not forget to take the test so test is more and more important so on the website orals on the mobile application you can able to see inside quantitative aptitude So Below the data interpretation Mains level so now you can able to see quantitative aptitude Mains so there inside it after posting every topic we will give you a test at the end of the video every video I will be telling you how the test works and how many questions I have given the test so based upon that the test will be added on the package so do not forget to write the test after watching the video so now let me move on to the Mains level series on quantitative aptitude so friends now let me move on to the eth video on aptitude Mains level series that is on the topic simple interest and compound interest and this will be the last video on the topic simple interest and compound interest so every topic I'm just covering four videos and four video with homework as well as test right don't forget to write the test as I've told in the front of this video right I've told you where the test is and how to write the test so always after watching the video don't forget to write the test that is most important here so now getting into this simple interest and compound interest so uh I have solved all the different kind of question that was asked in the various competitive exam that is on the mains exam so here also I will be solving some of the questions for the mains level and remember one thing there are two important formula which you can able to see on most of the mains competitive uh exam papers that is simple interest difference simple interest compound interest difference for 2 years simple interest compound interest difference for 3 years that formula P R square by 100 square so learn that formula and then we have two two formulas on simple interest as well as in compound interest right so now let me move on to questions here on the topic simple and compound interest so here is the first question so the ratio of difference between simple and compound interest for 2 years and same for the 3 years at R percentage per anom is 4 is to3 if after 2 years the interest received from the certain sum was Rus 5 percentage that is a rate of interest per anom compound interest for 2 years is 3,740 then find the sum so friend listen carefully if you can't able to understand the question here read the question again first try to understand the concept our Target is to find the sum that means sum means principal our Target is to find the principal and they have given one value that is 3,740 is the compound interest which was calculated annually in the rate of interest that is Rus 5 percentage so by using rate of interest Rus 5 percentage and the years is also given 2 years and the compound interest is also given by using all the value our Target is to find the principal but without knowing the rate of interest you can't able to find the principal here directly so first what we need to do is we need to find the rate of of Interest first and then after finding the rate of interest we have to substitute in the compound interest formula in order to get the principle so always remember that in the question if they have given the difference value I think previous video it's also we have solved one question that is based on two-ear difference threee difference so if the question is based on two-ear difference and threee difference most probably you can by by just applying both the formulas you can able to find the rate of interest because you can't able to find the principle at both the cases we are going to cancel the principle but at both the cases even if it is 2 years or 3 years difference you can able to find the rate of interest easily so here you can able to see initially they have given the ratio that is 4 is to13 so ratio has been given that is 4 is to13 for 2 years and the difference is four difference for 2 years as well as for 3 years is 4 is to3 that means we can write this as so 2ear difference divided by 3E difference is equal to 4 is 13 that can be written as 4 ID 13 so now we know the formula for 2 year that is P R square divided by 100 square so difference between simple and compound interest for 2 years so divided by difference between simple and compound interest for 3 years so P r² into 300 + r ided 100 CU so here we have 100 square here it is 100 Cub PR Square PR square is common but here we have addition Ally 300 + r so which is equals to 4x13 so mostly right if the if the difference has been given in terms of a ratio we can able to find the rate of interest why because in both the cases you can able to see the principal will be canc we can cancel the principle easily right so only letter that is reminding is R which means the rate of interest so now we can also cancel this right we have 1 by 100 squ remaining so once it goes to the numerator which is Cub / by 300 + r so which is equals to 4 / 13 so now we can cancel this also so which will be only 100 so 1,300 is equals to so 4 into 300 will be 1,200 + 4 R so 1,300 1,200 resultant will be 100 is equal to 4 R so R is equals to 25 which means the rate of interest is 25% so now uh we know the rate of interest by using the First Data what they have given in the question we found the rate of interest so once the rate of interest after finding rate of interest finding all the remaining value in the question is easy why because they have told that the rate of interest will be Rus 5 percentage so we already got R is equal to 25 so now r - 5 per that means is equals to 20% so now we got the rate of interest as 20% so rate of interest is 20% in the question they have given the compound interest which have calculated annually which is 3,740 so they have given the compound interest 3,740 and they have given the rate of interest and for how many years if after 2 years so this amount in the compound interest they have received after 2 years so time duration is also given 2 years so now the only thing is our Target is to find what is the sum that means me our Target is to find the principle so we know the compound interest formula P into 1 + r by 100 power n minus of 1 every time don't write this right so you have to directly apply all these in the formula just to understand I'm writing it so this should be written as 3740 is equals to principal what we need to find 1 + r by 100 so 1 + 20 by 100 so which means 20 by 100 we can cancel it 5 so 5 into 1 will be 5 5 + 1 will be 6 so this can be written as 6X 5 the whole s minus of 1 so 3740 is equals to principal and this will be 36 this will be 25 right so 36 by 25 minus of 1 right so principal so 3740 is equals to principal so 36 - 25 will be 11 so by 25 so principle is equals to 37 4 into 25 / by 11 so is equals to I think we can multiply this directly 3 * which is 33 so remaining will be 4 44 4 * 340 so 340 into 25 I think uh 0 85 0 0 right so answer for this question is 85 0 0 0 right which is that we need to find the principle here right Testament find the sum yes find the sum that means the principle our Target is to find the principle so answer for this question is 8,500 so friends understood or not right so the important part here sorry friends the important part here in this question is the difference formula right we have solved many question that is based on in the previous video don't I hope I hope you watch the previous video so previous video also is based on a difference difference between two year versus 3 years so here also they have given the difference but they have given the value in terms of ratio so we apply the ratio a is to B will be a by B so I have applied it and we found the rate of interest so always remember that point when you divide the difference formula of 2 years and three years you will not get the principal you will always get the rate of interest right so after finding the rate of interest we applied in the value what they have given in order to find the principle so this will be the answer for this question second question so a decided to invest an amount of 28,000 in two different scheme so scheme a and scheme B partially so scheme a gives 24% rate of interest per anom for 3 years and scheme B is 20% rate of interest which is compounded annually for 2 years if the total interest received was 15,964 solved many different question like this even in the compound interest Mains level Series so one amount total will be given that amount will be splitted into two different scheme and the amount what the invest amount what they have invested in scheme a and scheme B will not be mentioned in the question so we have to assume some amount that was invested in a and remaining amount will be invested in B and we apply the formula in order to find the principle so similarly here also we are going to do the same but one important thing in this question be careful on the calculation part why because the question solving method everything will be easier because most of the values are directly given but the only problem here is in the question is the calculation part because you have to frame a equation and then we have to add simple interest for 3 years and compound interest for 2 years in order to find the principle that part alone is most important because I've seen many students making a mistake only on that region right so now according to the question they have given the amount which is 28,000 that was invested on two different scheme that is on scheme a and scheme B and scheme a is the simple interest and scheme B is the compound interest and scheme a they have invested for 3 years and the compound interest they have invested for 2 years and now the value what they have given here is 28,000 is the total amount that was invested on scheme a and scheme B so some amount we let let's assume that X is the amount that was invested on scheme a so remaining amount will be X that is 28,000 minus of X will be the remaining amount which will be invested on scheme B some students will take X year and 28 Minus X year for the easy calculation that is completely upon your wish you can take either way but the final answerers should be correct that is the important part here so now let's find what is the simple interest for 3 years we know the formula simple interest is equals to p and R by 100 so now the principle we don't we don't know the principle but we have assumed it as X so invested amount as X number of years is three rate of interest what they have directly given in the question which is 24 percentage by 100 so I think we can cancel this on 12 two two table which is 50 so further yes if you we can further cancel it so if I cancel it this will be 25 if I cancel this will be 6 so now I think so 6 into 3 will be 24 18 6 4 are 24 I think further we can't able to cancel any number here right okay so let's keep the value as it is which means 18x by 25 so now this will be the simple interest for 3 years so similarly we can apply the compound interest value so p into 1 + r by 100 power n minus of 1 right so principal which is 28,000 minus of X and then 1 + r by 100 which is 20 by 100 and the compound interest they have taken for 2 years so 2 - 1 so friends remember one thing right if you are like practicing more number of questions right I hope you do it so when you practice more number of questions on the compound interest you don't want to write the step again and again every time why because if you know that the rate of interest is 20 directly write 11 by 25 because we write 20 by 100 and then we cancel it which is 1 by 5 so 5 into 1 will be 5 5 + 1 will be 6 6x 5 the whole Square 6 Square will be 36 5 Square will be 25 so 36 by 25 minus of 1 which will be 11 by 25 we are going to get the same value in all the question if the rate of interest is 20 so don't waste your time in the exams if you find the rate of interest as 20 write the principle which is 28,000 minus of X into 11 by 25 so friends understood or not where you can save more time on the exam instead of writing again and again every step if it is 20 write 11 by 25 similarly if it is 25 1X 4 which is 5x 4 25 by 16 if you practice more number of questions you will get that right just buy out only few numbers don't buy out for every number just for few numbers because 20 25 and then 10 so these are the numbers will be repeatedly asked in your competitive exams so try to buy out for some of the important numbers alone so now let's cancel it so or or else let's take this as the compound interest for 2 years we can we can stop here itself why because I got the base number 25 here also the base number 25 I think uh taking an LCM will be easy right so now according to the question the simple interest for three and the compound interest for two which is 15,900 yes 960 sorry 960 so which will be the value so now we know the simple interest which is 18x ided by 25 and then the compound interest value 28,000 minus of X into 11 by 25 is equal to 15,9 160 so now we got the base value LCM 25 so the remaining value will be so 18x so plus 28,000 into 11 yesus of 11 x is equal to 15960 into 25 so now 18 x 11 x so 18 x 11 x will be 7 x so 7 x is equals to 15960 into 25 so minus of 28,000 into 11 no other way I think we have to multiply it or else we can take 1 Z outside or else we can take 28 outside 25 outside because once you take 25 outside we can write this as that's also seem to be lengthy way okay no other way we can go with the multiplication right so we have 0 0 0 here 28 into 11 so which will be 38 308 right okay so now going with this number zero so 25 1596 so 1596 into 2 + 5 okay so 96 into 2 so we got 25 again 399 yes we are getting everything a zero here 159 300 yes we we are getting 20 0 so which is 399 minus 308 so once you subtract and we have to divide it by 7 so once you subtract it which will be uh 91,000 yes yes 91,000 so 91,000 ided by 7 1 * 7 remaining will be 2 13 times so answer will be X is equals to 13,000 so friends finally we got the value of x which is 13,000 000 so now according to the question our Target is to find what is the amount which was invested on scheme B so we already know that X is 13,000 scheme a the person what they have invested is 13 so we know the total amount is 28 so remaining will be 15,000 so 13,000 is the amount invested on scheme a so remaining is the 15,000 that is the amount which was invested on scheme B right very easy so these are the things that we need to be very careful on this question this part Cal calculation part and then this calculation part and then final calculation part right so always remember that to make the base number same because if the base number is different for example is this 25 and if it is example I'm saying if it is 12 so at this case you will feel difficult to solve this question why because you can't able to directly take LCM here here it is 12 here it is 25 so because of a same number this question is easy if the if the numbers are different taking and LCM will be difficult so at this scenario what I suggest here is to multiply this value instead of writing this we can directly write this as 72x yes so friend understood or not 24 into 3 24 into 3 will be 72 72 by 100 will be 0.72 X so we instead of writing this you can write this as 0.72 X because we will not get LCM here we will get direct integer number so we can substitute here instead of this value 0.72 so similarly instead of writing this 11 by 12 you can divide and find the answer and write something like 01 or9 something and then you will get the answer easily instead of taking LCM converting into a bigger number you can divide here to get on or one or two digit and then you can subtract it easily so that's the way we have to solve the question so try to solve many question that is based on 2 years 3 years difference based formula and then question that is based on uh there will be some amount will be invested on two different schemes or else some amount will be different on three different schemes so practice like that practice more number of question so that the calculation part seems to be easy so friends answer for this question is 15,000 third question so a borrows an amount of rupees 40,000 from a company at 20% rate of interest per anom compound interest which has been compounded annually so at the end of the year that is first year a person borrowed rupees 5,000 at the end of the second year again he borrowed 1250 at the end of the third year he paid rupees 2,500 interesting question just see he have taken initially some amount after first year uh he is not paying the loan amount what he is doing is he is again borrowing some amount from the company and in the second year also so again he is borrowing some amount to the company but in the third year he paid some amount to the company right and in the fourth year yes in the fourth year he paid all all the loan right and then our Target is to find find the amount paid by at the end of the fourth year so we need to find what is the total amount uh the person has paid at the end of the fourth year I think uh we can go with the traditional method itself step by step itself because all the value has been directly given in the question question so now what we can do here is according to the question they have given the principal principal is how much 40,000 so principal value they have directly given in the question rate of interest is also given which is 25% both the values are directly given here even they have given the number of years also first year second year third year fourth year so we can go with the step by-step process so now according to the question we know the overall amount will be P into 1+ R by 100 power n so which will be the compound interest now according to the question what they are saying is at the end of the first year the total amount let's take first year the person has borrowed 40,000 and what is the rate of interest which is 25 percentage let's see first here what is the total amount the person has so we can say the principal will be 40,000 right so into so just now I have told you right in the previous question if you substitute Ral to 25 resultant will be 1X 4 right so 1X 4 into 1 that means 5 4 into 1 will be 1 5 5 ID 4 power n so 5 by 4 so which is 25 five which is like 125 by 100 right 125 by 100 will be 5 by 4 so this can be written as 5x 4 so friends understood or not every time don't write like that try to BU out some of the Expressions which will be easy so this will be 5x 4 so again we can cancel it resultant will be 50,000 so 50,000 is what actually 50,000 is the total amount that was received to the person the loan what they have taken is 40,000 and the interest which is like 10,000 extra so that first year the person has to pay 50,000 but now what the person is doing here according to the question on the second year the person is borrowing some amount again from the company so what is the amount that the person has been borrowed here you can able to see 5,000 at the end of the first year he again borrowed 5,000 that means from 50,000 what the loan has to be paid so now the person is again taking 5,000 borrowing that means again taking loan from the bank which is 5,000 again which will be 55,000 so now for this 55,000 let's calculate on the second year what should be the total amount the person has to pay in order to fulfill the loan right so now 5x4 again by 4 is this value will not going to change why because this value will be common the rate of interest for every year has been not given they have given the common rate of interest which is 25 percentage for every year so that won't change so now we have to cancel it and we need to find the value yes we can so I think we can cancel it 1 4 are 4 so remaining will be 1 that is 15 4 3 is are 12 so remaining will be 3 that is 30 so 6 83 are okay we can go with 7 4 are 28 again remaining will be 220 5 4 are 20 0 so now 0 5 5 is are 25 remaining will be 2 35 35 + 2 will be 37 so remaining will be 3 15 18 1 6 8 750 so 68750 is what this has to be paid to the bank the total amount what the person borrowed now on the second year in or he he has to pay this much of amount to fulfill the loan to complete the loan which is 68750 so now on the second time right so this will be the first year and this will be the because initial year right and this first year he is borrowing 5,000 and on the second year from 68750 again the person what he is doing is he is borrowing some amount which is 1250 is he is borrowing on second year 1250 that means additional amount he is adding to the loan which is called as a borrowing from the bank right so now we can say that if we get 1520 addition which will be 70,000 is so now on the second year which is total will be 177,000 70,000 so now for the 177,000 we have to calculate the interest so which will be 5 by by 4 so we can calculate it so this will be 1 4 are 4 remaining will be 3 that is 30 7 4S are 28 remaining will be 2 again 5 2 5 4 are 20 0 0 so we can multiply it 0 0 5 5 are 25 remaining will be 2 35 37 remaining will be 3 which is 87,500 so finally again on the second year the total that the person has to pay is 87,500 now coming to the third year which is most important part in the question so in this 87,500 on the third year what the person has been doing here is he is paying 2500 rupees what does it means in both the cases we have added why because in both the cases the person has borrowed some money from the company again and again every year but when it comes to the third year the person is not borrowing any money from the company but what he is doing is he is paying some amount to the bank that means you have to subtract 25 year resultant will be 85,000 so friends understood or not so this will be the most most important part in the question do not add 2,500 to this number why because on the third year in this two year the person borrow some money again from the bank but on the third year he is paying some amount to the bank that means you have to subtract from here which is 85,000 so 85,000 again the rate of interest own change which will be 5x4 so now once you calculate this this will be the final amount what the person has to pay to the bank on the final year because our Target in the question is to check what what is the amount that paid by end of the fourth year so fourth year here what is the amount the person has paid so now let's calculate it so I think this will be 1 4 are 4 2 4 are 8 so again 1 4 are 4 remaining will be 1 4 2 are 8 so remaining will be 2 5 4 are 20 so 0er here so this will be zero 5 5 are 25 remaining will be 2 10 and 12 remaining will be 1 5 1 will be 6 52 are 10 so 10,600 sorry 1 lakh 1 lakh 6,250 1 lakh 6,250 so this will be the amount on the third year because in the third year we know that the total amount that was received and this money has to be paid on the fourth year so friends this will be the answer for this question so be very careful to solve this question and be very very careful go with the normal traditional method do not go with the formula method here formula means writing in a single step that that will that that might get a chance of making a mistakes more so try to understand it first year what the person is doing right this is not actually the first year this is the amount and this will be the second and this will be the third and this will be the final so friends understood or not and then after one year right and then after one year he is adding that means he is borrowing some amount so this act as the first year and this act as the second year and this act as the third year third year after after third year he is paying some amount on the fourth year what will be the final thing so be careful right and borrow borrow pay right if it is borrow borrow add the value to the loan what he already got if he pay something from the loan amount he is paying something to the bank that means you have to subtract the amount that resultant amount you have to calculate it for the next year right so this will be the answer for this question friends so finally I will be giving you some question as a test do not forget to take the test again and again I'm saying test is most important in the test itself I I will give you the solution also so that you can practice uh the you can after practicing you can see the solution clearly so practice more right only if you practice more number of question for mains you can able to crack the exam or else it is not at all possible so friends thank you so much so next topic on quantitative aptitude we can see from the tomorrow right every topic I will be posting four four videos so thank you so much so much for watching it and if you really like it share the video to your friends those who are preparing for the competitive exams so thank you so much bye",unknown
c2y0sULhQRg,"so friends this series is specially made for the bank exam aspirants those who are going for the mains exam like SBO Mains ibbs Mains RBA Mains so for those students as well as for students those who are preparing for the cat exams so this series is specially made for you and second importantly after watching this video do not forget to take the test so test is more and more important so on the website orals on the mobile application you can able to see inside quantitative aptitude So Below the data interpretation Mains level so now you can able to see quantitative aptitude Mains so there inside it after posting every topic we will give you a test at the end of the video every video I will be telling you how the test works and how many questions I have given the test so based upon that the test will be added on the package so do not forget to write the test after watching the video so now let me move on to the Mains level series on quantitative aptitude so friends now let me move on to the sth video on quantitative aptitude Mains level series that is on the topic simple interest and compound interest so already we have seen different kinds of model right starting from simple interest Concepts so I have told you there are very less formula on the topic simple interest compound interest form we have just two formula in simple interest two formula in compound interest and the difference formula so difference formula for 2 year and difference formula for 3 year and one important thing that I hope everyone knows it the formula that we used on a compound interest that is p into right so P into 1 + r by 100 power n so this is the formula that we use in the compound interest right so this formula we also use in another topic that is on the topic percentage population increase so in the concept of population increase right we use the same formula and similarly population decrease that is in a reverse order for example if in 2020 the population of a city is 1 lakh if the population what is the population in 2015 in case every year the population is getting decreased by 5% so they are going in a reverse order right so here if they ask a question from 2015 to 2020 we have to use the formula from 2020 to 2050 it's a reverse order so we use the same formula but only difference is 1 + r by 100 power n so we divide the principle 1+ R by 100 but here we multiply it so these two formula it's a compound interest formula but we use this formula on the population increase as well as population decrease and this formula we also use in another concept that is installment mobile phones or a bike so we pay the down payment and then the remaining amount has to be paid on the monthly Emi so installment basis so if it is an installment basis that to in a concept of a compound interest we apply this formula to find the installment how much installment has to be paid on the account right so these are the formulas are very little formula on the topic simple interest compound interest but the concepts and the Logics are more right because different different Logics questions will be there but we have to understand it and we have to solve the question so now we will be solving some of the questions here that is based on installment as well as question that is based on uh framing a equation on simple interest component that is most important right we have solved some question on the previous video itself again we let me move on to some of the difficult level questions here so now don't forget after watching this video do not forget to take the test test is most important because additional two question I have given on a test so once you practice that you will get an idea how the quantitative aptitude Mains level questions will be so now let me move on to the question of simple interest and compound interest on video number seven so here is the first question so the cost price price of the mobile is rupees 18,000 and Arun paid rupes 7,080 as a down payment and the remaining amount will be paid in the three equal installment at 20% perom rate of interest on compound interest right if it is a simple interest the question has to be solved in a differently but here it's a compound interest to find the installment amount for each year so first understanding this question is very easy so here uh the cost price of the mobile phone has been given which is $8 ,000 so just be careful while applying the values on a formula why because this is the principle right so this is the principle of a mobile so mobile phone that cost1 18,000 so now the person Arun paid how much 7,000 how much he paid 7,080 yes so 7,080 is the amount that is down payment he had paid initially and then the remaining amount has to be paid on the installment basis and our Target is to find what is the installment amount for every year that he has to pay to the uh loan right so he is taking a loan actually that is based on a compound interest so now just just listen the question carefully what are all the other values what they have given in the question so when you look at the other value the remaining amount will be paid on the equal installment so all the three installment is equal and that is in the rate of percentage 20 percentage perom so 20 percentage perom is the rate of interest just listen here when you subtract these two values this will be uh 10, right 920 yes uh 10,920 so 7 7 s 10,920 so 10,920 is the remaining amount after the uh down payment this is the remaining amount that the person has to be paid in the three installment basis and for every installment the rate of interest is how much 20% so just now I have told you while starting of this video and in the first first video itself I have told you right the installment formula is the same formula what we use in the compound interest so P into 1 + r by 100 power n that is the formula that we also apply on the population increase population decrease just now I have told you if it is an installment basis P divided by that is the difference right so P divided by so P divided by 1 + r by 100 power n so here alone be careful because he is going to make this payment $10,000 920 in three installment bases so this will be the first installment third year plus the second installment 1 + r by 100 second year and again P divided by 1 + r by 100 first year so first year second year third year so these are the three installment bases that the person has to be paid and we already know that all the three installment is an equal installment and what is the amount that need to pay in the remaining that is 10,920 so this 10,920 has to be paid in the three installment bases right and each installment is 20 percentage perom and the all the three installment will be equal so all the values they have directly given in the question so just listen carefully whether we know the principle no we don't know the principle because we can't able to apply the principle directly the principle is the installment amount this principle act as the installment amount do not substitute principal as 18,000 here because this is the initial cost cost price of that mobile phone so that principal you should not apply here your principal act as the installment amount so let's take the principle that is the installment amount as X so 10,000 920 is equals to X will be the installment amount so 1 + 20 by 100 so power cube right so similarly X will be the installment amount 1 + 20 s so Third x / 1 + 20 by 100 power 1 so now so once you cancel this this will be 5 * that is 1 by 5 5 + 5 into 1 will be 5 5 + 1 will be 6 so 6 ided by 5 so this can be written as 6X 5 the whole Cube so X ID by whole squ X ided by 6X 5 right so now 6 Cub will be 216 so 5 Square will be 125 bring this to the numerator so this becomes 125x ided by 216 so + 5 S so 25x / 36 so + 5x / 6 now when you take LCM as 216 so this will be 125x so this will be 150 x and this will be 36 180x so once you add all the value so 5 so 5 + 2 will be 7 14 1 15 remaining will be 1 so 1 2 3 4 4 55x divided by 216 and here is the remaining amount that is 10,920 so now we need to cancel this and we need to figure out the value that's it because our Target is to find what is the installment amount for each year that is mean that means we need because all the three installment is same so it is better to find one x value that is enough so if you find what is the value of x that will be the installment amount that the person has to pay in the every year so we can cancel the value so 455 so this will be 4 2 are 8 2 * 4 * is equals to x / 216 so X is equal to 216 into 24 so 6 4 are 24 remaining will be 2 so 4 6 8 12 1 3 4 so this will be 48 5184 so 5184 is the installment amount that the person has to be paid on the every year in order to pay the total amount of 10,920 so this will be the answer for the question so learn this part alone which is more important because even the EXP experts will make a mistake here because instead of substituting p as X they will substitute this 18,000 and they keep this value as X kindly don't do it this is not the installment amount this will be the installment amount for every year that installment value is unknown we don't know the installment amount so we keep the principle that is installment as X and this act as the remaining amount what the person has to pay except the down payment because initially you have did some down payment here so down payment is 780 so 780 is the down payment so after subtracting the total cost price and the down payment the remaining payment should be paid on the installment basis so be careful because I'm why I'm repeatedly saying this these are the concepts will be more and more important on the main level exams many Mains level exams you can able to see difference based question on simple interest compound interest was asked and then these kinds of installment based question so practice more and more number of question like this so that you will feel easy and many data interpretation the chart based simple interest compound interest also based upon this concept right so this will be the answer will 5184 so 5184 is the installment has to be paid on every year it is the answer for this question question number two so Arun invest the same amount in scheme a and scheme B for 2 years and the same rate of interest per anom so the interest amount given by scheme a which is in the simple interest and scheme B which is in the compound interest that is 4,500 and 45 4905 which is the compound interest and simple interest value has been given so our Target here is to find what is the invested amount because it's not about scheme a or scheme B because the person is investing the same amount on both the scheme so that amount was not given here so many value is not given amount is not given as well as the rate of interest is also not given only value what they have given in the question is the number of years so the years is for two years and the interest value has been given scheme a is the simple interest and scheme B is the compound interest so friends be careful on these type of question because if both the values are a compound interest we can divide equation one and equation two if both the values are a simple interest we can equate it but if one scheme is a simple interest and another scheme is a compound interest you can't able to divide it in this cases what we need to do here is first equate right both the equation frame equation one and equation two on both the schemes after framing both the equation try to apply value what we found on equation one to equation 2 or equation two to equation one so that we can able to find any one of the value why because here the principle is same rate of interest is same everything is same so we just want to frame an equation perfectly and then I will tell you how to solve this question and and it's very important question understand that how we are solving these type of questions so first we what they have given is the first scheme a so let's take scheme a is the simple interest scheme so in this simple interest scheme the simple interest value is directly given in the question which is 4,500 so 4,500 is the simple interest so we know what is the simple interest formula so P NR by 100 so simple interest to what they have given in the question is 4,500 so now we know that in the question the number of years is two so we can instead of n we can directly substitute two here 1 2 are two so this becomes 50 times so principal is not given in the question rate of interest is not given in the question so other than that they have given only one value which is number of years so I substituted here so resultant will be 450 into 50 that's it so other than this we can't able to simplify anything right if you if you can you you can simplify you can WR only the principle divided by R but according to me we can we can't able to simplify further let's keep this as equation one so now similarly they have given the second scheme that is scheme B which is in the term of compound interest so this compound interest value for 2 years is also given in the question which is 4905 so 4905 is the compound interest So based upon the compound interest formula let's frame on another equation so what is the compound interest formula so p into 1 + r by 100 solve very slowly right so that we won't make any mistake because of if you're going for a Mains exam time doesn't matter so we have to solve it in a perfect way so this will be the compound interest formula so in this compound interest formula again the principle is not given what about the rate of interest rate of interest is also not given but the number of years is 2 minus of p is equal to 4905 so now this can be written as p P into 1 + r see R by 100 so this can be written as 100 + r so this part can be written as 100 + r the whole Square ided by 100 square minus of p is = to 4905 so friend understood or not so now let's take LCM as 100 square here if I take LCM as 100 square so P into so 100 + r the whole Square so minus of so m mly 100 square here which will be 10,000 10,000 p is equals to 4905 into 10,000 right so when what I did is I have taken LCM as 100 square here so now what we can do is we can simplify this equation because it's in the form of a + b the whole Square so a square which will be 1,000 + b² that is r² + 2 R that is 200 into r so here we have the remaining value which is um minus of 10,000 p is equals to 4905 into 10,000 so now we can multiply P inside so once you multiply P inside here we will get plus 10,000 p and already here we have minus 10,000 P so we can cancel this - 10,000 p and plus 10,000 P so remaining value will be p r² + 200 R is equals to 4905 into 10,000 so now here P r² 200 R I think we can take uh let's see p r squ okay just a moment we have to multiply P here I think we can take p r common once you take p r common here so here we have only R and then here we have 20 is equals to 495 into 10,000 so friends finally this this will be the second equation because we can't able to further simplify it so what we did is we have multiplied P inside all the three terms sorry here I forgot to multiply P At Last I have multiplied P here in both the expression we have P R and P R so I have taken p r outside so remaining equation if you can you can further simplify it or else you can keep the equation as it is so now this is the point where we have to think and solve the question if it is based on one simple interest another scheme on a compound interest in initially I've told you right you have to substitute try to substitute the first equation value on a second equation or else the second equation value on the first equation so just see here we got PR R is equal to 4,500 into 50 so we already know that in both the scheme the rate of interest is same principle is also same so instead of PR R here we can substitute the value that is 4,500 into 50 that is r + 200 is equal to 49 05 into 10,000 so friends understood or not what I did is I have substituted the equation one value in equation 2 instead of p r so now let's try to cancel it 3 0 so we can cancel 1 2 3 0 and now 450 5 5 are 25 2 5 4 are 20 22 so this will be r + 200 is equals to 49 05 0 so now we can cancel it so this be comes 250 450 so 450 will be 2 times so remaining will be 40 again 41 * 8 so 218 so R isal to 218 minus of 200 which will be R is equal to 18% so this is not the final answer why because we found what is the rate of interest here but now according to the question our Target is is to find what is the invested amount because both the invested amount is same so you can substitute R here instead of any one of the equation so if you instead of R if you substitute here resultant will be the Principal that is the amount what they have invested in the part right so 18 instead of R substitute 18 and try to cancel the value so resultant value will be 12,500 something that will be the principal amount right that will be the invested amount because the question is based on investment amount so friends this is the important question where we can able to see this question on again many data interpretation that is based on I've seen 2017 or 18 the question that is based on one column that is completely based on scheme a completely based on the simple interest scheme and there is another column which is completely based on a compound interest scheme so the value will not be given in the da all the values that they will be giving like principle is same in both the scheme rate of interest is same in the both the schemes similarly they will be giving you only the number of years or else interest value will be given at sometimes rate of interest will be given number of years will not be given so you have to think and solve right in some cases if both the simple interest or compound interest schemes both the schemes are as same interest then we can divide and we can find out the answer if it is different you can't able to divide it you can't able to directly divide these two because it's a simple interest and it's a compound interest but the principle is same rate of interest is same so we try to substitute the value so practice more number of questions automatically you will get that idea right so this will be the answer for second question which is 12,500 so once you substitute it you will get answer as 12,500 so here is the third question so the difference between the simple interest and the compound interest for 2 years of a certain amount is 31.25% of the difference between the simple interest and the compound interest for 3 years on the same amount if the interest amount for the same sum in 2 year of the compound interest is 9240 find the initial investment okay so what they saying is if the interest amount for the same sum in two years of a compound interest see the compound interest for two year has been given which is 9240 that is the one value what they have given in a question 9240 is what the compound interest that was received after 2 years on the same sum that is the previous value sum so applied here for 2 years and the resultant compound interest what the person received is 9240 so by using this value our Target is to find what is the initial investment initial investment is nothing but the principle so what is the principle that the person invested we need to find here but at the starting of the question you can able to see the first three lines are the most important part here because it is based on 2 years difference 3 years difference formula just read the question carefully the difference between simple interest and compound interest for 2 year of a certain sum so we know that 2year difference formula on a certain sum we don't know what is the principle or nothing but we know the difference formula for 2 year but read the question carefully the difference between the simple interest and compound interest for two year on a certain amount so two year on a certain amount is that is equals to 31.25% of threeyear difference formula so friends understood this or not this is the most important step on this question try to understand this what they are saying read the question again so difference between the simple interest and compound interest for two year of a certain amount so difference between on a certain amount is this value is equals to 31.25% off they have mentioned the word of off of the difference between so off of the difference between the third year that is difference between simple and compound interest for 3 years so now what we can do is so this will be 2 year divided by 3 year is equals to 3125 divided by 1 2 3 4 0 instead of uh percentage 100 so two decimal point divided by another 100 so now we know the difference formula it's it's not the two year it's a difference two year right difference of simple interest compound interest two year difference of simple interest compound interest for 3 year so now the difference between the simple interest and compound interest for 2 year for formula that is p r² by 100 square we already know this formula right so we can substitute here that is p r² / 100 squ this formula will be the difference between the simple interest and compound interest for 2 years so similarly we know the another formula that is p r² into 300 + r divided 100 Cub so this will be the formula that we use for a difference between simple and compound interest for 3 years so is equals to so 312 5 ided by 10,000 so now we can cancel it so I think we can cancel this PR Square PR Square here so we have 100 square and we can cancel 200 so remaining 100 will be there so once it goes to the numerator or else we can reciprocal the value so if I reciprocal the value then this can be written as so this will be like 10,000 divided by 3125 right so now when you have the this value to the numerator so this will be 100 so 300 divided by 100 so 300 + r so divided by 100 I just reciprocal the value right so now what we can do is so this will be 3125 I think this will be 3 3 * 3 3 is are 9 5 3 are 15 1 so this will be 3.2 times so once you multiply this so 300 + r is equals to 32 0 right so R is equals to 20% so friends understood or not what I did so if you can't able to understand how I write this no no issues just bring the 100 to the numerator so 100 divided by 300 + r so here we have 3125 ided by 1000 you can cancel here itself but what I did is I just reciprocal the number for the easy calculation you can do like that also you can keep the number normally and also you will finally you will get the same answer as R is equal to 20% so now this is not the final answer because we got the rate of interest as 20% but still we have to find what is the invested amount so we know the invested amount is easy to find why because they have given one value that the compound interest is 924 so 924 is the compound interest that was received by the person for 2 years on the same same sum so everything is same so we know the value that is p into 1 + r by 100 power n minus of P this will be 9240 and the number of n will be two years they have given in the question right so two years of a compound interest so number of years will be two and what about the rate of interest just now we found the rate of interest is 20% so substitute all the values here so we will get so 1 + 20 by 100 so power 2 minus of 1 is equal = to 9240 so P into this will be 5 * 5 + 1 6 by 5 so 6X 5 the whole s- of 1 is = 9240 so p is equal to 36 minus of 25 ided by 25 is = 9240 so this will be p is equal I'm sorry friends so p is equals to so this will be 11 / by 25 is equals to 9240 so principal I think we can cancel it this will be 8 * 88 so remaining will be 4 44 so this will be 4 * 40 so 840 into 25 so principal will be 0 21,000 right so 21,000 will be the principal amount what the person invested here so which will be the answer for the question because our Target is to find what is the initial investment and the same sum has been given that means the principal is everything same here also here also in both the cases it is same so we can say that the principal will be 21,000 right so very interesting question and this part alone is important so how we applied here to find out the answer right so friends now I have given two question as a homework uh that is in the test series I have given the test so so go and write the test same solve the same question additionally two question I have given in a different logic right so write the test I have given the solution also so write the test only then you can able to understand that what are all the mistakes that you are doing so once you understand the mistakes keep on while if you keep on solving many test then surely you will crack whatever the mains exam will be and how the exam T will be so you can easily clear the exam but it requires a lot of practice so friends thank you so much for watching this video and if you really like it share this video to your friends those who are preparing for the mains level exam so thank you so much for watching this bye",unknown
lnFSiA6hYj4,"so friends this series is specially made for the bank exam aspirants those who are going for the mains exam like SBO Mains ibbs Mains RBA Mains so for those students as well as for students those who are preparing for the cat exams so this series is specially made for you and second importantly after watching this video do not forget to take the test so test is more and more important so on the website orals on the mobile application you can able to see inside quantitative aptitude So Below the data interpretation Mains level so now you can able to see quantitative aptitude Mains so there inside it after posting every topic we will give you a test at the end of the video every video I will be telling you how the test works and how many questions I have given the test so based upon that the test will be added on the package so do not forget to write the test after watching the video so now let me move on to the Mains level series on quantitative aptitude first of all thanks for being here in my YouTube channel so here is the sixth video on Mains level quantitative aptitude Series so here we are going to discuss about the topic simple interest and compound interest so previous video we have solved some question on simple interest compound interest and then I have given a test so similarly in this video also we are going to see simple interest another set of question on the topic simple interest and compound interest and again after watching this video do not forget to take the similar level Mains level question on the quantitative aptitude test package right so if you take simple interest compound interest previous video itself I have told you we have only limited number of formulas so simple interest we have two formula compound interest we have two formula Additionally you have to learn two formulas that is one is for installment so if it is a question that is based on an installment concept we have to learn one formula and at last the difference formula so difference for 2 years and difference for 3 years you can solve the question also without using a formula right without bi adding a formula you can go with the normal traditional method itself but it takes more time when compared to formula method right that's what simple interest compon interest does not contains a huge formulas we have only limited number of formula so it is better to learn the difference formula for simple interest for 2 years and difference formula of simple interest and compound interest for 3 years right so based upon those formula in case if you have question I can solve in this video so now let me move on to some of the important question on simple interest compound interest on this main Series so question number one so the difference between simple interest and compound interest for two years for a certain amount is rupees 360 and the difference between simple interest and compound interest for 3 years for the same sum and the same rate of interest per anom is 1,33 find the principal amount so just now I have told you there are questions that you can able to see more on more that is based on difference based question right so here you can able to see the difference for simple interest and compound interest for two years has been given similarly the difference between simple interest and compound interest for three years has been given so based upon that our Target is to find what is the principal amount but in both the cases the principal is same as well as the rate of interest is same so everything is same so B based upon those formula what we already buy it we have to apply all the value and we need to simplify it to find what is the principal amount so first you guys already know it what is the formula while teaching simple interest compound interest itself I have explained this formula so difference for two year so difference for two year P r² divided 100 squ so this is the formula for 2 years so difference between simple and compound interest for 3 year is similarly P r² right the numerator will be same divided by here we have 100 square because of two years because of 3 years we are writing this as 100 Cub do not buy add this learn like this right 100 square for 2 year 100 Cube for 3 year additionally add 300+ R that's it right everything is same so don't sit and buy it like that so better learn like this will be the easy way so first PR Square PR square is common because of two here we have to write 100 square because of three here we have to write 100 Cube additionally we have to write 300 + r that's it so so same formula can be written in different different way it's your wish but finally the formula will be 3 years 2 years this formula right so now according to the question what they are saying is the difference between simple interest and compound interest for two years so this value what they have given is difference between simple interest and compound interest for 2 years which is 360 so 360 Let's assume this as equation number one so similarly they have given the simple interest compound interest difference for three years so we know the formula for 3 years P r² 300 + r / by 100 Cub is equals to the difference so 3 years what they have given a difference is 1 1 3 1 1 3 4 yes 1 1 3 4 so this will be the equation number two so finally we got two equation so now we need to first we need to find any one value either we can equate this to find the principle directly or either we can equate this to find the rate of interest first and then we can solve the question so what I'm going to do is I'm just going to divide 1 / 2 right I'm going to divide both the equation so while dividing this we got 360 ided by 1 1 34 so friends understood so now while dividing these two values so P r² divided by 100 squ multiplication because once you divide this this goes to the numerator this comes to the denominator right so once this goes to the numerator so this will be 100 Cub divided by so P r² into 300 + r slowly solve this question we can cancel P R square P Square here so similarly we are here we have 100 Cube and here we have 100 square so in numerator we will be having one 100 in the denominator we will be having 300 + r so is equals to 360 by 1134 so I think we can we can cancel it on two table if I cancel it on two table 18 2 are 36 180 so cancel this on two table just a moment 180 so cancel this on two table so 5 2 are 10 remaining will be 1 6 2 are 12 remaining will be 1 7 2 are 14 so I think uh now we can six 5 2 are 10 1 6 2 are 12 1 7 2 are 14 again I think we can cancel this on okay again we can go with the three table right 6 3 are 18 30 so go with three table 1 3 is are three so remaining will be 2 8 3 are 24 remaining will be 2 9 3 are 27 so again we can go with two table so this will be 20 times so this will be 63 right so so finally we got 20 divided by 63 so friends understood or not so now we can cancel 0 0 here so this will be 630 is equals to 300 this will be 600 + 2 R so 600 630 2 R is equal to 30 so R is equals to 15 so finally what we got here is the rate of interest sometimes in some question the rate of interest will be given at some point we have to solve the question in a different way so usually we have learned this method right in many of the simple interest compound interest formula if 2 years value three years value has been given what we used to do is we find the difference or else we divide first equation by second equation to find the rate of interest so similarly we know the difference for 2 years 3 years because of principle is same rate of interest is same we are dividing both the values so once you divide both the value we got the rate of interest so now according to the question our Target is to find what is what we need to find here is the principle amount so it is very simple substitute R is equals to 50% here in order to find what is the principle either one of the equation so if I substitute principle into 15 into 15 divided by 100 into 100 is equals to 360 so now you can solve this in order to find what is the principle right so 15 125 30 16,000 right so we will get 16,000 so 16,000 000 will be the principal amount so when this is the way we have to solve the question that is based on a difference of 2 years and 3 years so try to buy out this formula in case if you I hope you already learned this formula in case this is the first time if you learning the formula kindly learn this and buy add this because most of the cases this formula will be helpful instead of going with the traditional method you can directly go with the formula method so this formula will definitely helpful to solve most of the difficult question that is based on both simple and compound interest right so this will be the answer for this question second question if the total amount after 3 years and the interest amount after 5 years for the certain sum of rate of interest per anom for the certain sum at the same rate of interest per anom of a simple interest is rupees 2,560 and 12,600 respectively so find the total amount after 4 years so I think uh it's it's a kind of a different question because our Target is to find what is the total amount after 4 years so we need to find what is the overall amount that that means we need to find the value of a after 4 years and the complete question is based on a concept of simple interest right but look at the values carefully they have given two value 21560 and 12,600 so what does the value is if the total amount after 3 years so what they have given us they have given the total amount that is after 3 years which is 2,560 so this value is the total value total amount after 3 years and the second value what they have given us 12,600 so 12,600 is what the interest amount after 5 years so 12,600 just look at both the values this is the overall amount value and this is the interest amount after 5 years So based upon this and they have given the principal as well as the same rate of interest so same rate of interest and the principal value is also both the values are not given so they have given the interest for 5 years and the overall amount for 3 years so now what we can do here is just just listen the values carefully so 3 years 21560 for a simple interest we know the overall value formula a is equals to P plus interest that is p n r divided by 100 yes so now what we can do here is we know the a amount that is for 3 years which is 21,5 160 is equals to so let let's take the p as it is right because the principle what they have mentioned here is so the total after 3 years yes they have given the three years so n we can consider it as three so p + P into so into 3 into R / 100 so now we can either further simplify it or else we can write this we can assume this directly as equation one so principle so 3 p r divided by 100 is equals to 21560 so let's take this as equation number one in case if we required we can simplify this or else we can keep equation number one as it is so now equation number two so we know the interest amount for 5 years so interest formula PNR by 100 so PNR by 100 which is the interest formula simple interest formula is equals to 12,600 and the interest what they have given is for 5 years so instead of n we can substitute five so 5 P can cancel this on 1 5 are five right so we can cancel this on 20 times so so now once you bring p r is equals to 12 0 0 0 so 122 so this will be 252 so 252 so 252 s so now 252,000 what we got is the value for PR right so PR alone the value what we got here is 252,000 so now what we can do is instead of PR we can substitute this value 252,000 so friends understood or not because second they have given the interest so first they have given the overall amount so by canceling the value we got PR value alone which is 252,000 so once you substitute 252,000 here so this equation will be p + 3 into 252,000 we can cancel two 0 and we can cancel two 0 so the remaining value what we have is 3 into 2520 is equals to 21, 560 so now principal is equals to 21560 minus of so 0 6 151 7560 which will be principal is equals to 14,000 something right so we got we already know that principal which is 21,500 so minus of 7560 which will be 14,000 so 14,000 is the this is the overall amount so this is the principal which is 14,000 so now we got the principal as well as the overall amount for 3 years so now it is easy to find out what is the interest for one year so if you subtract 14,000 21,600 that will be 7,560 and what is a target here our Target is to find the total amount for 4 years right first we can find for one year because if you subtract this 14,000 and 21,500 resultant will be 7560 right when you divide this by three so this becomes 3 2 are 6 1 5 3 is are 15 2 0 so this will be 2520 will be the interest amount for one year so now according to the question our Target is to find what is the overall amount total amount after 4 years so that means the overall amount what we need to find is the principal as well as interest so now the interest is 2520 which we have calculated only for one year but according to the question our Target is to find what is for 4 years so 0o 4 2 are 8 remaining 5 4 are 20 remaining will be 2 4 2 are 8 which is 10 so 10,800 so 10,800 is the interest and 4 ,000 is the principal what we what we already found so finally we can say that answer for this question is 2480 so 2480 will be the overall amount after 4 years right so friends a very very interesting question the concept plays a major role here right if you like first time learning all these kindly take a note of it because previous question we have learned how to divide the difference formula and here we have learned how to substitute the value of P are in the first equation because the first value what they have given is the overall amount second value what they have given is the interest amount that is for 5 years and this is for 3 years so first we have written the 3 years formula that is overall amount formula and then for N I have substituted three second only the interest formula for p and N I have substituted 5 years after finding p r we can directly substitute in this equation for PR in order to find what is the value of the principal value because we don't know what is the princip we know the overall amount we know the interest so we found the principal is 14,000 so when you subtract overall amount and principal resultant will be the interest for 3 years so this will be the interest for three year so divide by 3 one year interest is 2520 so this will be the onee interest so one year interest but our Target to find foure overall amount once you multiply this by four we got the four years simple interest so four years simple interest as well as the principal 14,000 result will be 2480 so 2480 will be the overall amount for this question after 4 years third question so sueta invested a certain amount in scheme a which gives 12% rate of interest for 4 years and the remaining amount was invested in scheme B which gives 8% rate of interest for 5 years if both the schemes gives the equal interest and total amount in both the scheme is2 ,900 just listen the question carefully so the person s first initially a certain amount in scheme a and then the remaining amount in scheme B and what they have mentioning here is at some point if both the scheme gives the equal interest and the total amount equal the interest is same so that means the simple interest one as well as the simple interest two is same so what we can surely do here is we can equate it first data we can find what is the simple interest second data we can find the second simple interest and we can equate it in order to find either the principal or rate of interest whatever be and they have given the total amount invested in both the scheme is 20,900 so what we can do here is one way right the total has been given 20,900 so uh let's consider the first person invested 20,000 in scheme here the remaining amount in scheme be so either way uh we can solve it in two different ways but I think the easy way to solve this question is we can assume this scheme a the amount what they have invested is X scheme B will be y why because in both the scheme the person s what they have invested is not given but the total amount has been given the total amount invested in both the scheme is 20,900 so once you take this as X we can take this as 20,900 minus x one way of solving a question or else we can take the principal amount what the person invested in first scheme as X and the principal amount what the invested in the second scheme S as why so now we know the formula PNR by 100 which is the interest formula so similarly here also it's a simple interest so PNR by 100 and the principal is X and the number of years according to the question First Data what they have given is four years and the second is 5 years so four rate of rate of interest is divided by 100 and the rate of interest what they have given for the first is 12 percentage and we know both the simple interest one and simple interest two are equal so we can say simple interest two is why because the principle is different so number of years is 5 years and the rate of interest which is 8 percentage divided by 100 so we can cancel 100 and 100 here so 1 14 is are 4 2 4 are 8 1 2 are 2 6 2 are 12 so 6X is equal to 5 y so this can be written as X by Y is equal to 5x 6 that means the investment ratio so by using the data that is simple interest and compound interest is same we didn't find out the principle we have found what is the investment amount ratio which is 5 is 6 so X is to Y will be 5 is to 6 that means the person's with invested in scheme a five part and scheme b six part and we already know that the total part what the invested in both the scheme is 21,000 right no 20,900 so 20,900 is the total amount so it is easy to find what is the investment done on scheme a because 5 divided by total which is 11 into 20,900 so we can cancel this 1 * 9 * 0 0 so 0 0 45 4 so 95 so 95 is what the person what the Thea what they have invested on the first scheme so similarly the remaining amount will be on the second scheme so now we found out of this 20,900 so sua invested 9,500 in scheme a and the remaining amount will be on scheme B so now what is the question here is we need to find anyone right find the interest amount received from any of these schemes that means we either we can find a or b any one of the schemes right so interest amount so we know the interest formula is PNR by 100 so principal this 9,500 because both the interest are same right so either if you find interest for this or interest for this we will get the same value that that's why they have given a clue that both the interest is same so we can substitute in any one of the value right so 9,500 into 4 into 12 ided by 100 so we can cancel 0 0 here so once you multiply this will be 48 into 95 so 4 9 5 are 8 5 are 40 4 6 40 4560 so 4560 will be the interest that is received on the scheme a so similarly when you substitute here also the interest will be same so when this is the way we have to solve a question that is based on some different sort of questions you can able to see more and more on simple interest and then many of the competitive exams the simple interest compound interest main level I say any of the competive tough level competive exams simple interest compound interest has been asked in the form of table chart in data interpretation so they will give you they won't give you the principle amount so they have just given principal as Dash first scheme so second scheme principal will be Dash and in the what they say is they give a clue simple interest and compound interest and this much years will be equal So based upon that we have to find all the table value and then we have to solve the question that we have seen on 2017 or 2018 SBA poo Mains I think so we have seen a question which is related to simple interest and compound interest and many years simple interest compound interest for on most of the competitive exams they have given more and more importance to this topic in the tough level competitive exam so learn this topic give more and more importance to simple interest compound interest if you are preparing for a bank exams right so so friends now uh we have solved three question so now go to the test package you will see five question as a test right so previous video also after posting a video I've given two question test and now three question the same three question what we solved here plus add add two question I have given a test write the test I have given the solution also you can able to understand it write the test so similarly after posting every video the test will be given do not forget to take the test on time right so friends thank you so much for watching this video so still two or three videos are there on the topic simple interest compound interest we can solve it more number of questions so friends thank you so much for watching this video and if you really like it share the video to your friends those are preparing for the competitive exams so thank you than you so much bye",unknown
ak6DMQKzs4I,out of a sum of rupees 850 a part was lent at 6 percentage simple interest and another part at 12% simple interest if the interest on the first part after 2 years is equal to the second part after 4 years so the clue is directly given in the question because here you can able to see the interest first part after 2 years is equal to the interest of the second part after 4 years so here you can able to see both the interest are getting equal so first is simple interest for 2 years is equals to the second simple interest for 4 years but here according to the question the total sum is how much 840 and the part was lent out that means from Total 850 two part was lent out so let's assume that the first part as X so second part will be the remaining 850 minus X so that's it solving a question is now very simple so simple interest formula we know that P and R divided by 100 so second simple interest P and R divided by 100 so first principle we can take it as s x number of years so number of years is two so what about the rate of interest so rate of interest is 6 divided by 100 so similarly the second will be 850 minus X number of years will be 4 and the rate of interest will be 12 divided by 100 so we can cancel 100 and 100 here so similarly we can cancel 6 2 are 12 we can directly cancel 12 here so now we have X is equals to so 850 into 4 minus of 4X so when you bring this 4X towards left hand side which is 5X so 5x is = to 850 into 4 so once you cancel this 1 5 are 5 remaining will be 3 7 5 are 35 170 into 4 so X is equal to 680 so we can say that the value of x is equals to 680 and according to the question our Target is to find what is the second part so X which is called as the first part the second part will be 850 - 680 will be 170 so 170 will be the second part 680 will be the first part,unknown
cESxOsTUo5k,"a invested rupees 2,000 in simple interest at the rate of R percentage perom for 5 years so B invested the same amount that means both the person are investing the same amount so here R percentage here r + 5 percentage so here it's for 5 years here it's for 6 years so the total interest obtained by A and B together is 3,900 find the value of R so our Target is to find the interest here both the principal amount is same interest is different one is R second is r + 5 and here in the question we have a clue the total interest was 3,900 so which means simple interest 1 plus simple interest 2 is equals to 3,900 so PNR by 100 is the formula so principal is the common what both the people invested so 2,000 divided by 100 n and R so number of years so here number of years is five rate of interest is R so here number of years is six rate of interest is r + 5 so once you calculate and we can find what is the value of R easily so 2 0 2 0 here so this becomes 20 so this will be 5 R 6 r + 30 is equal to 39 0 0 so this will be 11 R which is 220 R and this will be 3 2 are 6 600 is equal to 3,900 so 220 R is equals to 3,300 yes because when you subtract this so resultant we can cancel 0 0 here so cancel it on so R is equal to 1 * 22 5 * so R is equal to 15 percentage so answer for this question is 15 percentage",unknown

mktMjwxyZcs,"so friends this series is specially made for the bank exam aspirants those who are going for the mains exam like SBO Mains ibbs Mains RBA Mains so for those students as well as for students those who are preparing for the cat exams so this series is specially made for you and second importantly after watching this video do not forget to take the test so test is more and more important so on the website orals on the mobile application you can able to see inside quantitative aptitude So Below the data interpretation Mains level so now you can able to see quantitative aptitude Mains so there inside it after posting every topic we will give you a test at the end of the video every video I will be telling you how the test works and how many questions I have given the test so based upon that the test will be added on the package so do not forget to write the test after watching the video so now let me move on to the Mains level series on quantitative aptitude first of all thanks for being here in my YouTube channel so here is the fifth video and the second topic on quantitative aptitude that is simple interest and compound interest on Mains level Series so first four videos we have seen one topic that is problems on ages and where we have solved all the different kinds of mains level question as well as I have given the test so now here is the fifth video starting the next topic on quantitative aptitude that is simple interest and compound interest so if you are preparing for especially if you are preparing for any Bank exams like ibbs Po Mains or SBA po Mains RB po Mains whatever the mains be give more and more importance to this topic alone simple interest and compound interest why because when we take the previous year question papers of various Bank exams especially Mains question papers you can able to see more number of simple interest compound interest question were asked on every exam even some of the exams you can able to see data interpretation that is based on simple and compound interest right so give more importance and remember one thing here for the mains level question percentage method or a traditional method it's not at all helpful only the formula method understanding the question applying the values what all they have given in a question in a proper way in the for formula helps you to find the answer shortcuts will not at all help you to solve in the mains level exam question right so uh before solving a question on Mains level that is for simple interest compound interest I hope you know all the basic formulas right simple interest formula and overall amount on simple interest and what is compound interest how the compound interest is calculated and what are all the different formulas that we have in a component I hope everyone knows it I don't want to waste your time by explaining all these but remember one thing there are additionally some of the formulas are there in simple interest and compound interest one is a difference formula so for 2 years simple interest to compound interest different formula will be difference right difference formula for both simple interest and compound interest for 2 years as well as for 3 years difference between simple interest and compound interest we have two formulas that is p r² by 100 p r CU 300 + r so while solving a question I will tell you I I hope you already know it so those two formulas are important in simple interest and compound interest and another important formula is the installment formula right because uh installment based questions like a person purchase a bike initially by paying a 30 30,000 down payment and the remaining amount he has to pay in the installment so that installment based questions we we can solve that question Alone by a normal traditional method or else by a formula method but for solving that question by formula for installment basis we have a separate formula so if you want to learn that formula yes you can or else better you can learn the normal compound interest formula and you can solve the question that is that is upon your wish right and then uh if you take simple interest compound interest concept there is one concept which is called as population based for example a city has one lakh people and in 2020 the city has been increased by 25% in population and what about the population in 2030 if the population is keep on raising this much so those kind of questions can be solved by using a compound interest formula if it is a population increase so we use a formula P into 1 + r by 100 power n if it is a population decrease or if you are going in a reverse order for example uh from 2030 if you are if we need to find what is the population on 2020 then we go with the formula P ided by 1 R by 100 power n so I have posted a separate video on it on percentage topic or in a compound interest Topic in my channel itself I have posted it right so how to find the population increase population decrease uh things I think in a percentage topic I have posted it so these are the important concepts are there in a simple interest and compound interest so major you have to learn all the four formulas basic formula right simple interest formula overall amount compound interest formula compound interest overall amount and the second set of formula is the difference formula so difference formula for two years simple interest compound interest one formula different difference for 3 years we have another set of formula right other than that if you want you can learn the installment formula so installment concept formula is there only one formula that we have P / 1 + r by 100 power n So based upon the number of years we apply the values and we found out the formulas right so that is the last formula right when you take a concept a basic concept question or else question that is related to an installment or else the question that is related to the population right so these are the most most important Concepts that you can repeatedly able to see on the most of the mains exams right and then uh the the most thing is in the simple interest compound interest in case if the principal value is not given most of the questions you can able to see some some value will be given the principal amount what the person has been invested in a bank that will be given in the question but most of the cases if the value was not given assume that I am investing some amount in a bank that some amount will not be given anywhere else in the main questions Mains level questions where you can able to see when when you start solving a question you can able to find it so if the principal amount was not given in the question uh you can take it either as 100 or you can take it as th000 base value I'm saying base value because the amount what the person invested was not given so at that scenario what you can do is you can take it a base value as 100 or th000 that will be always a better choice to solve the question do not take the base value as 200 500 like that because you will make a mistake while finding a percentage value so always take a base number 100x so 100x is the base number let's assume that I'm investing 100x in a bank and then you start solving a question or else you can take it as thousand X so that you can get without any single digit you will get three digit two digit number so that you can find the answer easily that is another way of solving a question but at any point do not take a base value like 50 150 200 500 like that take it 100 or th000 right so and then other than that I think you know everything let's let's uh solve the question so so that you can understand why I'm saying all these stuff initially because you just want to know how the questions will be just like that going to solve a question will not helpful right so first understand what what all the different sort of questions are previously asked in the mains exam that's what I'm saying now right so these are the things are asked in the previous uh Bank Mains exams as well as when you take upsc uh question papers the principal amount will not be given many years I have seen upsc question paper simple interest compound interest the principle will not be given so we have to assume it as X and then we have to solve the question so that's more important right so now let me move on to the mains level question on the fifth video that is on the topic simple interest and compound interest so here is the first question so the average investment of 15,000 is invested by Raj in two scheme A and B and the ratio of Interest per anom of the scheme A and B are 15 percentage and 20% respectively so the scheme a is in the simple interest and scheme B is in the compound interest at the end of 2 years he got the total interest amount of rupees 11,240 find the investment in scheme B so once look at the question carefully understanding the question is very easy not like problems on ages because problems on ages like we understand the question itself it takes more than 30 seconds to understand it properly but here you can able to see the question is very easy to understand so there is a person Raj who invested the average investment is 15,000 so if he invested in two scheme so that means 15,000 is the average so the total investment will be 30,000 right so 30,000 is the total investment he done on two scheme that is scheme a and scheme B so now what they are saying is scheme a is simple interest and the scheme B is in the compound interest right so and then what are all the remaining values they have given us so the simple interest that is scheme a the rate of interest is 15% so that value is also given here so 15 percentage so similarly compound interest rate of interest is 20% perom so these are the values they have directly given in the question and then they have given after 2 years that means after 2 years the common right for the simple interest they have calculated for two years compound interest also they have calculated for 2 years so after 2 years the interest that was received in scheme B and the interest that was received in scheme A and B so total is equal to how much 11,240 so that value Val is also directly given so now our Target is to find what is the amount that was invested in scheme B so this is our Target to find so just listen carefully the principal amount in both the cases was not given but here they have given the total investment is how much 30,000 so if the total investment is 30,000 then what we can do here is we let's let's assume that the person Raj has invested x amount in scheme a and then the remaining amount which is 30,000 minus of X that will be the remaining amount that will be he will be investing on the second scheme B so we have learned all those techniques on simple interest compound interest itself if the total is given he is investing in two scheme then first scheme is X now second scheme will be remaining amount 30,000 minus X so now what we can do is we can go with the normal method don't try to use any shortcuts or nothing like that so here let's find what is the simple interest that he got for 2 years so what is the formula that we have so simple interest is equals to PNR by 100 so what is the principal x what about n number of years that is two so rate of interest is 15 so divided by 100 so it's we can still we can reduce it 1 2 are 2 this will be 50 times cancel it on five table so this will be 10 times this will be three times so we can say that the simple interest after 2 years he will be receiving 3x by 10 so now let me move on to the second scheme which is in compound interest so what is the compound interest formula so compound interest will be P into 1 + r by 100 power n minus of 1 so this will be the compound interest formula so principle will be 30,000 minus of X 30,000 right okay so 30,000 minus of X and this will be 1 + R by 100 which means 20 by 100 and this is also for 2 years so minus of 1 so this will be uh 30 K minus of X so now I think we can cancel it 20 we can cancel this on five times so 5 into 1 will be 5 5 + 1 will be 6 so 6 divided 5 we have to square it so 6 Square will be 36 so 5 Square will be 25 so minus of 1 so again this can be written as 30,000 minus of x so this will be 11 / 25 so 11 ID by 25 this will be the compound interest that was received by the person Raj in scheme B after 2 years if you if you want we can further simplify it for example uh if you multiply 30,000 into yes we can simplify here also so uh 25 so this will be 12 times so 1,120 0 into to 11- of 11x / 25 so now this will be 132 0 0 so minus of 11x ided by 25 will be the compound interest for 2 years right and this will be the simple interest for 2 years either you can keep you can stop here and you can uh go with the substitution or else you can simplify it right either way so now according to the question what they have mentioned here is so simple interest after 2 years and compound interest after 2 years which will be 11,240 S so 11,240 will be the total total interest that was received after 2 years so now according to the question our Target is to find what is the amount that was invested in scheme B once you find the value of x solving the question is easy here so 3x ided by 10 so compound interest will be 1320 so minus of 11x / 20 5 is equal to 11,240 so now we can uh bring this towards right hand side so this will be like 3x so we can take LCM as 50 first let's take LCM 50 here so once you take LCM as 50 so this will be like 5 * so 15 x and this will be like 2 * 22x so is equals to so we can cancel the values here so into 5050 so now because this will also be in minus and this will also be in minus so we can cancel both the values right so 15 x 22x so 5 7 x so this will be 7 x is equals to 0 1 1960 is that the value what we are getting here 7x = to 1 1960 so X is equal 2 so 7 2 are 14 uh remaining will be 556 8 7 are 56 so 280 so still we need to multiply this by 50 right sorry I didn't multiply this by 50 so 0 0 5 are 40 4 14,000 so finally we can say that X is equals to 14,000 that means the total amount that the person invested on scheme a will be 14,000 so what about scheme B scheme B will be the remaining amount which is 16,000 so that will be the answer for this question so friends understood or not it's not like many students will ask me can can I use any other way to solve this question no even though you use different methods but most probably 99% of the questions on the mains that is based on simple interest and compound interest we use a normal formula method right only then we can able to solve the question so be very careful multiplication part addition part because if you make any one small mistake here and the complete answer might be wrong right so that's what I'm saying each and every step is important multiplication is important and then uh equating or either some question we have to equate it for example we take it as equation one and equation 2 and we have to solve both the equation so on all those cases solving simple interest compound interest understanding the question everything is easy but the only problem here is multiplication part calculation part will be more so be careful on that so that you will get surely you will get the correct answer at the end so friends finally answer for the first question is 16,000 so here is the second question so ABA invested a certain amount at 15% rate of interest per anom in simple interest and a certain amount invested at 10 percentage per anom at again in a simple interest so at the end of two years the total interest that was received is 5,400 and if the rate of interest is interchanged the total interest is increased by 200 so find the total investment so when just see here there is a person ABA she has has invested some amount but that amount was not given so that's the reason I've taken this question because initially I've told you right so either the principle will be given in the question or sometimes the principal value itself will not be given in the question so in the previous question you can able to see the principle value was not directly given but they have given the total investment is 30,000 so that by using the value we have assumed the first investment as X and the second investment as 30,000 minus X but here when you look at the question carefully the person abin she has invested some amount but that investment amount itself is not given in the question so in in those cases for example like question like this where the amount what they have invested itself is not given so at that point so consider some base value take it as 100x as the first investment because the exact value we don't know what is the person invested so what we can do is the first investment let's consider it as 100x and the second investment let's consider it as 100 y so friends understood or not so this is the way take a a base value and then try to solve the question at any point do not take it as 50x or do not take it as 200 500 like that right easy if you take 100 or th000 so that you will get an answer easily so now according to the question what they are saying is the person ABIA invested a certain amount at 15 percentage rate of interest at simple interest and similarly second rate of simple interest at the end of two 2 years the total amount received was 5,400 that means simple interest 1 2 years simple interest two for 2 years the total amount what the person received is 5,400 so it is easy because both are simple interest formula so we can say that PNR by 100 so principal first investment which is 100 x y number of years is two what about the rate of interest is 15 percentage so divided by 100 so similarly the second of simple interest because first and second investment both the investment was not given so we have invested we have assumed the first investment as 100 100x and the second invested as 100 y so similarly the principle 100 Y into for 2 years and the rate of interest is how much 10% divided by 100 so interest simple interest for 2 years simple interest for 2 years so resultant will be 5,400 so now we can simplify it so I think we can directly cancel 100 100 here similarly we can cancel 100 here so that's the reason I have said this right so once you take 100 as a base value you can easily simplify the question so now 15 into 2 is 30X so + 20 Y is equal to 5,400 so again we can cancel all the0 so 2y is equal to so now we can assume this as equation one so now what they have given another point in the question is and if the rate of interest is interchanged for example instead of 15 you have to take it as 10 and instead of 10 you have to take it as 15 in case if the rate of interest is interchanged but the investment value is same if the rate of interest alone is interchanged then the interest after 2 years it has been increased by 200 that means the interest after 2 years will be 5,600 because it has been increased by 200 so when you add 200 here it will be 5,600 so again same logic so X for 2 years but the rate of interest alone we have to apply 10 so divided by 100 so similarly the second 100 Y into 2 years into so instead of 10 you have to substitute 15 so divided by 100 so cancel it cancel it so now this will be 20x and this will be 30 Y is equals to 5,600 cancel 0 0 0 here so 2x + 3 Y is = to 560 so this will be equation two so now if you solve both the equation it is easy to find any one of the value so what is our Target our Target is to find the total investment so total investment finding is very easy because we once you find the value of X and Y that will be the total investment right I'm sorry sorry friends so now let's multiply this by two so once you multiply mly this by 2 so this becomes 6X 4 Y is equals to 1080 so similarly multiply this by 3 so 6X and this will be 9 Y is equals to so when once you multiply by 3 6 3 is are 18 remaining will be 115 116 1680 so minus- minus we can cancel it this will be 5 Y and this will be minus we can cancel both the minus value so this will be 600 so Y is equal to 120 so substitute y equal to 120 here so once finally we got the value of x as well as we got the value of y our Target is to find the total investment so substitute X is equal to 100 here 10,000 substitute y equal to 120 year 12,000 22,000 so 22,000 will be the answer for this question right so friends in this video I have solved only two question just I want to explain you majorly because these are the concepts are more important right because many students don't know they assume this as Principle as it is they take it as p and they take it as p and then try to solve the question you will not get the final answer because if both the investment we don't know whether it is same or whether it is different so in those cases we can't able to consider it as p and p so that's the reason we have to assume some of the value in the previous question we can't able to assume it because the total value has been given like 30,000 so from that we assumed as X 30,000 minus X but here the value investment itself was not given so in those cases we have to take a base number like this to solve a question easily so friends now in aptitude session the same Mains level session you can able to see five questions I have given as a test so two question what I solved here plus addition three question I have given as a test so go and take the test solution is also I have given right so you can able to understand the solution easily write the test be very slow understand the concept even if you can't able to solve the test question just you have a solution everything was has been given on the test itself so try to analyze what all the mistakes you have done why you can't able to understand the question so so that next next thing you can easily improvise and you can solve the question easily at any point do not fed up like uh if you can't able to solve the question I've have seen many students they can't able to understand some difficult question so they fed up and they won't prepare for the exams kindly prepare it because everything is a Basics if you are strong on the basics everything is possible even the question is very difficult it is possible to solve and do not expect shortcut for the main level question so friends thank you so much for watching this video and I'm really sorry for this throat air and there issue so thank you so much for watching this video and if you really like it share this video to your friends those are preparing for the main exam and do not forget to take the test by today so thank you so much bye",unknown
KK25-lf_a3A,"so VI invest rupees 15,000 as a fixed deposit at the bank at the rate of 10% perom simple interest so due to some pressure needs he withdraw the entire money after 5 years so the bank allow him a lower rate of interest so if he get 8,250 less than what he actually get at the end of 10 years so that means he actually invested a 15,000 amount for 10 years in a fixed deposit but due to some reason he withdraw the money in 5 years itself so because of withdrawing the money because of not taking the money after 10 years you have taken the money before 5 years so that the bankers reduced the interest which is 8250 less than actually what he got after 10 years so from this we can get a clue that so simple interest one difference of simple interest 2 will be 8250 so friends understood or not so simple interest what he should actually get in 10 years but because of he withdraw in 5 years he is getting 8,250 less that means the difference between both the simple interest will be 825 so now every value we have in a question so principal which is 15,000 we can take 15,000 common so divided by 100 common so here 10 years and what is the rate of interest actually is 10 percentage right so minus of second he withdraw the amount in 5 year but rate of interest is unknown so 8250 so here we can cancel two 0 1 150 so when you bring this 150 again we can cancel 0 and 0 here so now so this can be written as 15 again we can bring the 15 here this will be uh 100 minus of 5 R is equal to 825 / 15 so we can write like this so that so th000 when you bring this towards left hand side so 100 minus of 825 / by 15 is equal to 5 R so this will be 1,500 minus of 825 divid 15 isal to 5 R so 5 R is equals to When You Subtract this 500 275 so into 5 which is 9 percentage so we can say that the rate of interest here is 9%",unknown
IbtaciLUudg,two equal sum of money was invested one at 9x2 per perom and other at 4 percentage perom at the end of 7 years so the simple interest received from the former exceeds the received from the later by 31.50 so the each sum was so after reading this question you can able to see two equal sum of money that means the principle on both the cases were same so first you can see 9x2 percentage per the first interest second interest is 4 percentage perom and year is also given that is 7 years so here you can able to see one important word exceeds that means when compared to the first simple interest the second simple interest exceeds 32 31.50 that means the difference between I've told this many times if I have 10 Rupees you have 20 rupees then we can say that you have 10 Rupees exceeds than me that means more than me so here you can able to see the both the simple interest difference is 13 31.50 so now solving the question is very easy so PNR by 100 difference nothing but subtraction PNR by 100 is equals to 31.50 so here we know that the principle is same so 100 we can take outside similarly n will be number of years number of years is also same so we can say take seven outside so rate of interest so first rate of interest is 9x2 percentage so 9x2 we can take it as 4.5 minus of second rate of interest is 4 is equals to 31.50 so 7 p is equals to so here you can see 4.5 minus of 4 will be 0.5 so 0.5 is equal to 3150 0 so while we multiplying into by 100 right so when you multiply this by 100 so this becomes 3150 so here so principal is equals to 3150 divided by 7 into. 5 so 7 into .5 3.5 so when you multiply this this will be 900 so we can say that the answer for this question our Target is to find each sum was that means the principal amount so the principal amount here is 900,unknown
4Ye6amxHsBs,so friends this series is specially made for the bank exam aspirants those who are going for the mains exam like SBO Mains ibbs Mains RBA Mains so for those students as well as for students those who are preparing for the cat exams so this series is specially made for you and second importantly after watching this video do not forget to take the test so test is more and more important so on the website orals on the mobile application you can able to see inside quantitative aptitude So Below the data interpretation Mains level so now you can able to see quantitative aptitude Mains so there inside it after posting every topic we will give you a test at the end of the video every video I will be telling you how the test works and how many questions I have given the test so based upon that the test will be added on the package so do not forget to write the test after watching the video so now let me move on to the Mains level series on quantitative aptitude first of all thanks for being here in my YouTube channel so friends here is the fourth video on problems on ages that is on quantitative aptitude main series and this will be the last video for the topic problems on ages so totally we have seen four videos and similarly the next video will be on time and work so I will be posting four videos on time and work for main Series so similarly I will be continuing all the remaining quantitative aptitude topics right so now let me move I hope you have taken the test so kindly watch the video number one first and then write the test video number two and then write the test so similarly after watching every Mains video after watching the video do not forget to take the test after uh after posting a video I'm updating the test so every new test will be added after uploading a video so do not forget to take the test on the aptitude reasoning session so now let me move on to the next set of question on Main series on this video so first question so the ratio between the present age of daughter and a son is 4 is to 5 and the present age of father is 32 years more than the age of the daughter so the age of the father 4 years more than the mother so the ratio between the present age of mother and the age of the son after 9 years is 4 is to three so the difference between the average age of father and mother and average age of son and daughter so when you see here uh again I think there is no direct clue has been given in the question everything is based on a ratio value and 9 years 12 years 32 years Etc so first let's understand what we need to find here so totally there are four person so father mother son and a daughter so we need to find average for father and mother and average for son and daughter and we need to find the difference here so this is our Target final Target so here when we look at the first point of the question so similarly we can try to frame a equation or else based upon the question we can solve it slowly and we can find one person age right x value by because ratio has been given if ratio value has been given we can easily equate any two person ages and we can find what is the value of x so once you find the value of x we can able to find one person age if you find one person age in the question so finding the remaining all the 4 person will be easy so let's target how to find one value that is X so what is the first point here so ratio between the present age of daughter and the Sun is 4 is5 so daughter and the Sun the age ratio has been given which is 4 is to 5 so let's assume that 4X and 5x right is the age of daughter and a son so now this has been the presentent age right that's important so present age of daughter and a son has been given first point so what about the second point so present age of Father 32 years more than the age of a daughter just see present age of a father so present age of a father is 32 years more than the age of a daughter we already fixed the daughter age as 4X so father present age will be 4x + 32 right so P represents the present age while practicing practice like this why because problems on ages question mostly we will make a mistake one because of present past and a future after finding a value you should fix that this is present age or a future age or a past age right so once you fix that value correctly solving equating question will be very easy so now third point so this will be the present age of the father so now age of a father is 4 years more than the age of a mother so just here age of a father is 4 year more than the age of a mother so mother age or father age what we can do is Father age is 4 years more than the age of the mother that means mother age plus 4 will be the age of the father and we already know that father age will be 4x + 32 so substitute here so 4x + 32 is equal to Mother + 4 so mother is equal to 4x + 28 so this will be the age of the mother so now we found age of The Mother We found the age of the father and the daughter age and the son age so every value we found now our Target only target is to find the value of x year so now what is the next similarly what are the remaining points they have given ratio between the perent AG of mother and the son after 9 years where the ratio is 4 is to3 so just look at the point carefully ratio between they have given a ratio 4 is3 so that ratio 4 is to3 is what percentage of the mother so percentage of the mother is how much 4x + 28 perc age of a mother to the sun age after 9 years Sun age is how much 5x after 9 years that means 5x + 9 is equals to the ratio what they have given is 4 is 3 that means 4 / 3 so now after solving this we will get definitely we will get what is the value of x so once you find the value of X substitute any of the area we can exactly find what is the age of the person so now let's simplify it so 12 x + 8 3 is are 24 2 684 is equals to so 20 x + 36 so now this will be 8 x 48 right so 8 6 are 48 so X is equal to 6 so finally we got the value of x is equals to 6 just know I've told you if you find one value then finding all the remaining value is easy why because we got X is equals to 6 that means what is the daughter age here so 4X 6 4 are 24 so 24 is the daughter age what about son 5x so 6 5 are 30 so 30 will be the son age 24 will be the daughter age what about the father age so substitute 6 here so 6 4 are 24 so 24 + 32 so 24 + 32 resultant will be 76 76 will be the age of the father so now what is the age of the mother here 6 4 are 24 so 24 + 28 which will be 52 so 52 will be the age of the mother so finally we found all the person present age so now what is our Target our Target is to find what is the present just a moment yes average present age of father and a mother so father and a mother average present age is so 76 52 so this will be 6 + 2 will be 8 so this will be 128 which is 54 right so 54 will be the average age of father and a mother so similarly we need to find for son and daughter so son and daughter son is how much here 2430 which is 54 uh divide by 2 that is 27 so 27 will be the age average age of son and daughter average age of father and mother is 54 so now we need to find what is the difference here so difference between both the values so difference between both the values is 27 right is 27 so answer for this question is 27 I think it's a easy level question so try to understand that so these are the points are more important right how to find the percentage of all the person that is the only area usually students used to make a mistake because once you find that present age for all the person definitely we can equate at any point so once you equate it because the ratio value has been directly given so remember one thing the clues will be there in the question on average if an average value has been given in the question that will be the main clue or else if the percentage value has been given that can be one clue or else any ratio value if they have given that can be the clue so by using these three important points in the question you can easily frame and equate the equation so now finally 27 is the answer for the first questions so here is the second question so the ratio between the age of P 1 year ago and the Q is 4 is to 5 so and the age of S 5 years ago is 75% more than the age of R after 5 years so the ratio of the present age of Q and R is 2 is to 1 so the sum of the present age of P and S together is 65 years find the average age of P and R together see our Target here is to find what is the average age of P and R so but when you look at the question carefully totally how many persons are there there are four person so P Q R and S and there are two important Point once you read the question carefully you can able to see there are two important Point here one is they have given one person age is 75 more than the other person so by using that you can easily write one ratio value because once you consider one person age as 100 percentage another person age will be 175 so by using that value you can easily find what is the ratio of Ages of both the person one thing and second importantly you can able to see the sum of the present age of P and S together is 65 so they have given the sum addition of two person ages total is equals to 65 I think by using a percentage value as well as by using the previous point from from the last you can see the one one line before it you can able to see there are some of the percentage of P and S so I think we can easily frame one equation there and by using a percentage value we can frame one equation I think we can solve the question easily so now getting into the first line of the question so the ratio between the age of P 1 year ago and Q is 4 is to 5 so they have given two perc rage that is p is to Q which is 4 is to 5 so they have given the age as 4 is to 5 so now let's consider the P age as 4X and the Q age as 5x so now b careful this is not the present age of both the person because what they have said in the question is the ratio between the age of P one year ago so P one year ago that means they're talking about the past so past ratio age has been given so now we can say that the P present ratio age will be 4x + 1 so friends understood or not so they have given one year ago that means they have talking about the past age so bring the age P to the present so 4x + 1 that will be the present age of p and what about the Q Q has been directly given so Q present age will be 5x understood or not so now we bought both the person age of p and Q to the present year so next point of the question so age of S 5 years ago is 75% more than the age of r that is five after 5 years for 5 years ago and after 5 years for two person has been given one is for S and the second is for R so just look at the question carefully S and R where s is 75% more so once you consider the r as 100 percentage then s will be 175% right so once you cancel this on 25 table so this will be four times this will be seven times so now we can take the age of s as 7 y so 7 y will be the age of s our age as 4 y so friends understood or not and be careful here so this 7 Y and 4 Y is not their present age why because they have mentioned that age of is 5 years ago so age of is 5 years ago so bring them to the present so age of present age of s will be 7 y + 5 so now this will be the present age of s so similarly present age of R so this value what they have given is for 5 years after after 5 years these two person percentage value has been given so this r value what they are telling is for after 5 years so bring the our age to the present so minus of 5 that means 4 y minus of 5 so now we bought the present age of S and R and we bought the present age of p and Q so I think here you can able to see both the values are X both the values are y somewhere we can equate and we can find what is the value of X and Y okay let me move on to the remaining points here still many points are there in the question so just see the next point the ratio of the present age of Q and R is 2 is to 1 so they have given the ratio of Q and R so Q is how much 5x R is how much 4 y minus of 5 so what is the ratio what they have given us 2 is 1 that is 2 by 1 so now we can simplify it this will be 5x so this will be 8 y so 5 into 2 will be 10 so this can be written as 5x - of 8 Y is = minus of 10 so now let's let's we consider this as equation number one so similarly we can move on to the next equation equation is what and just now I have told you right that point is most important sum of the present age of P and S together is 65 so P and S together right so P and S together sum of their ages so P and S together sum of their ages is equals to how much 65 so p is how much here 4x + 1 and S is how much here 7 y + 5 is equal to 65 so now 4X and 7 y so 4x + 7 y + 6 is = to 65 so 4x + 7 Y is = to 59 so finally we got the second equation that is 4x + 7 Y is = 59 so now it is easy to solve both the equation and to get the value of X and Y because just now I've told you while reading the question itself there are there are two Clues which is included in the question one clue is the percentage value and the second clue this value P and S because these are the direct statement right so these are not the direct statements but when you look at this point the total age of P and S is 65 it's a direct point so once you read the question properly and if you practice more you can surely get the Direct Value which point they have given a Direct Value so here they have given a direct sentence so by using that we have framed one equation so here they have given one percentage value by using that V framed another equation so now our Target to solve this question that is we need to solve the equation that's it so what we can do is we can multiply this by four and we can can multiply this by five in order to cancel the value right so once you multiply the first equation so let's multiply the first equation by 4 so 5 4 are 20 x so 20 x 32 Y is = to- of 40 so multiply the second equation by 5 so this will be 20 x multiply by 5 7 5 are 35 so + 35 Y is equals to multiply by 5 this will be 9 5 are 45 mining will be 4 so 5 4S are 5 5 are 25 25 + 4 will be 29 so now minus minus minus and we can cancel both the value so resultant will be minus of 67 is equals to minus of again here also we have minus right so this will be 335 so Y is equals to I think uh 7 6 5 are 30 so I think uh we can say that Y is equals to 5 right 7 5 are 35 remaining will be 3 6 5 are 30 30 + 3 so Y is equal 5 so friends finally we got the value of y equal to 5 so substitute y on any of the equation to get these two person ages and similarly substitute value of y in any one equation here we will get what is the value of x so Y is equals to 5 right so we can substitute any one of the equations so we can substitute here so once you substitute Y is equal to 5 so this will be 5x - of 40 is = to- of 10 so 5x is = 30 so X is equal to 8 so finally we got both the person ages that is X is equal to 6 and Y is equal to 5 so now according to the question what is our Target is we need to find the average age of P and R together right so P and R is enough so p is 4x + 1 and R is how much 4 y - 5 so 4 x + 1 that means X is equal to 6 here so 6 4 are 24 24 + 1 will be 25 so plus r so r y is equal to 5 so 5 4 are 20 20 - 5 will be 15 so this will be 15 so 40 so 40 / 2 which is 20 so finally we can say that answer for the question the average which is 20 years so this will be the answer for this question right so very interesting that's what I have said it for the past three videos and even in this video I'm saying we have Pro problems on ages we don't have any formulas right none of the formulas are there to solve the question by using a formula so and most importantly the logic if you understand the logic of the question solving any difficult level question is easy on the topic problems on ages just you have to understand whatever the age has been given make sure to bring all the person age to the present that will be the basic thing in all the question bring all the person ages to the present and then look at the question carefully what are all the clues they have given in the question by using the clue how we can equate it so once you equate the question or equate the two uh uh values what they have given in the question or either in a value of x or X and Y so just when you equate it you will definitely get one value so after find finding one value one person exact person ages finding all the remaining will be easy so practice more number of question and here I have solved two question so now I will give you three question as a test so totally I have given four test on the problems on ages right so first four test and from next video we be on time and work so I planned for time and work for video so time and work similarly I will be teaching you like this Mains level question and then I will be giving you a test also so do not forget to take the test so friends thank you so much for watching this video and practice more practice like this be very slow and steady while practicing because speed is not at all important here you have to understand each and every value what they have given in the question and then solving a question and getting the final answer is the most important Target in the mains exam so so be very slow practice very slow definitely you can able to crack any of the mains competitive exams even though the exam is very difficult surely you can able to crack it when you practice like this so friends thank you so much for watching this video and if you really like it share the video to your friends those who are preparing for the competitive exams so thank you so much bye,unknown
Cm5pGCfySVE,"Mohan lent some money at 9% simple interest and an equal amount of money at 10 percentage simple interest for 2 years if the interest was rupees 760 what was the amount that was lent in h case so here after reading this question you can able to find one important word equal amount that means the person moan lent some money so this money is same in both the cases so we can take the principal common on both the cases and after 2 years you can see after 2 years the total interest was 760 that means the simple interest 1 plus simple interest 2 is equals to 760 and we know the simple interest formula PNR / 100 so plus PNR / 100 is equal to 760 and we know that the principle will same in both the cases so we can take P outside so divided by 100 outside as well as N means number of years so number of years according to the question they have mentioned for two right so 2 years so rate of interest is N9 similarly second 2 years and the rate of interest is 10 is equals to 760 so P ided by 100 so this will be 18 + 20 is equals to 760 so P / by 100 into 38 is equal to 760 so we can cancel uh 38 one time so this will be 2 * 20 so principal is equals to 2,000 so finally we can say that the person moan lent 2,000 as the initial amount in both the cases it is same because they have given the word that is equal amount so we can say that in each case the amount that was lent is 2,000",unknown
uXue_uQAVX4,so friends this series is specially made for the bank exam aspirants those who are going for the mains exam like SBO Mains ibbs Mains RBA Mains so for those students as well as for students those who are preparing for the cat exams so this series is specially made for you and second importantly after watching this video do not forget to take the test so test is more and more important so on the website or else on the mobile application you can able to see inside quantitative aptitude So Below the data interpretation Mains level so now you can able to see quantitative aptitude Mains so there inside it after posting every topic we will give you a test at the end of the video every video I will be telling you how the test works and how many questions I have given the test so based upon that the test will be added on the package so do not forget to write the test after watching the video so now let me move on to the mains level series on quantitative aptitude first of all thanks for being here in my YouTube channel so friends here is the third video on quantitative aptitude main series that is on the topic problems on ages so already we have seen two videos I hope you have already watched the two video and every video after teaching some question I have given two question as a test so I hope you have taken the test so similar leer also we will be solving a Mains level problems on ages question and then after two or three question after solving this video I will be giving you some question as a test don't forget to write the test right so getting into the first question on video number three so the present age of gkes is double the age of penes after 3 years and the age of pranes after 2 years are the same as the age of Priya 2 years ago so the ratio between the age of Priya after 2 years and the age of Deepa 2 years ago is 2 is to3 and the average age of them is same as the age of gkes before 12 years so find the present age of cukes so friend after reading this question so similarly none of the point was directly given what is a target here our Target is to find what is the present age of the gkes so we need to find what is the present AG of gkes so after reading this question I can able to see there are totally four person one is gkes Priya Deepa and prai I think totally there are four person so always remember that while solving a Mains level question mostly on the topic problems on ages two Clues will be there one either the clue is in the format of percentage for example one person age is 50 percentage more than the second person so those sentence will definitely have some clue inside it and second is the average so first video also we have solved a question on average second video also we have solved a question on average based to concept always remember that here also I think just look at the last two point of the question what they have given us so and the average age of them is same as the GES so average age of them is same as the Kish that means totally there are four persons so we need to find the four person average which is equals to gkes age 12 years ago so I think that will be the clue most of the question that average point will be the clue okay so first what we can do is totally there are four person right so penish so penish uh and then there are Priya right and then Deepa and at last is Guk so totally there are four person so let's assume this as a b c d so that for an easy calculation we can assume all the person ages as AB B CD so now getting to the first point of the question so the present age of gkes is double the age of pra so the present age of gkes so present age of gkes is d right is double the age of The Prana so PR we have taken it as a and what they have given us after 3 years so here gkes AG is D pra age after 3 years that is a + 3 what they have given is it's double the age so when compar to PR G's age will be double so we can write this as 2 by 1 so friends understood or not right pra age double is Guk age so we have considered gkes as D PR after 3 years is a plus d so now simplify it so we can write this as D is equal to 2 a + 6 so finally we got the GES present age is equals to 2 a + 6 according to the first point right so second point right so they have directly given the percentage of gcas is double that means the value what we found here the Gage age will be 2 + 6 which will be the present age age of gkes second point so age of PR after 2 years are same as the age of priia 2 years ago so both the person ages are same so when it same is 2 years after 2 years ago so we can say that age of pesh after 2 years so pesh we have considered it as a so a plus 2 years after 2 years is equals to so what they have given us Priya 2 years ago so Priya is how much B so 2 years ago B minus 2 so this can be written as so B is equal to a + 4 so finally we found the person B present age of B that is preer is equals to A + 4 just listen carefully so D value we have written in terms of a b value we have written in terms of a so if we find C value that also if we written in terms of a finding an average is easy because every value is converted into a once you taken an average for that number we will get what is the value of a so once you find any one person Age solving the entire question is easy that's what we are going to do here right what are still some more points are reminding in the question so the ratio between age of priia after 2 years so the age of Priya after 2 years which is B+ 2 right so next Point what they have given us and the age of Deepa 2 years ago Deepa is C so 2 years ago C minus 2 so what ratio they are given is 2 is to 3 that means 2 2 by 3 so now let me equate this so this can be written as 2 b + 6 is = to 2 C minus of 4 so now 2 C is equals to right 2 C is equals to 3 b + 6 + 4 will be 10 so when just just look at the values carefully here we got D value in terms of a just now I have told you B value in terms of a so now if we got C value is also in terms of a finding an answer is easy so how will you convert this value in terms of a instead of B A + 4 substitute here so 2 C just see 2 C is equal to 3 into so instead of B I'm substituting a + 4 so a + 4 + 10 so this can be written as 2 C is equal to so 3 a + 12 + 10 right so 3 into a 3 into 4 12 so here we have 10 so reminding us so 2 C is equals to so 3 a a + 22 so C is equal to 3 a + 22 / 2 that's it so finally we got the C value is also in terms of a so D value in terms of a b value in terms of a a value we can keep as it is and we can start solving a question so now according to the point what they have given us average age of them average age means all the PO all the four person average age so first person a b c d so all the 4 person average is equals to gkes present age 12 years ago so gkes present age will be 2 a + 6 12 years ago that means minus of 12 so friends understood or not what they have given us average age of them so all the four person average age of them is same age of GES is the same age of GES 12 years ago so present age of gkes is 2 2 A + 6 and 12 years ago so minus of 12 right so now substitute the value so instead of a we can keep a as it is instead of B so B already we found a + 4 so substitute a + 4 here and what about C value so C value will be 3 a + 22 / 2 and what about D value 2 a + 6 is equals to so 4 into 2 will be 8 a so this will be minus of 6 so so 6 4 are 24 so friends understood or not right so what we did here is finally we have written all the values in the L average part and then we already know that average of 4 person is divided by two so multiply by four towards right hand side and keep all the remaining numbers here so now let me write this as again we can take LCM as two so a + a will be 2 a here we have 2 a so totally we have 4 a here so 4 a into 2 right because we need to take LCM so 4 a into 2 will be 8 a so here we have 4 and here we have 6 6 + 4 is 10 LCM is 2 which will be 20 so + 3 a + 22 so totally divided by 2 again when you multiply by 2 here 8 into 2 is 16 a minus of 48 so now we have 8 9 10 11 right so 11 a so when you bring this 11 a towards right hand side so so this will be 5 a so now we have 20 year 22 here which is 42 so 42 + 48 so 42 + 48 will be 90 so this will be 90 so here a is equals to 15 are 5 18 so once finally we got the value of a is equals to 18 so just now I have told you once you take an average and if you convert all the values into a same value or a same number find finding one person AG is easy so now we got a is equals to 18 according to the question our Target is to find what is the present age of gkes so substitute here a is equals to 18 so 18 into 2 is 36 + 36 + 6 will be 42 so 42 year is the present age of the GES so which will be the answer for the first question right so friends understood or not very simple question even when you look at the some previous year question papers of SBI po Mains or a cat exam Mains questions you can see the the steps will be more right you can able to see the the complete steps will be 10 or 20 steps to solve a question but writing all the steps converting into a proper equation will be easy Once you know how to write the basic ages of a person so that's enough see I have not used any formulas any new technique nothing all the values were not directly given we frame the equation and only one important thing is finding this part alone so always remember that the clue of the question will be mostly on an average or else on the percentage sentence based upon the sentence we can definitely find any one person age so friends answer for the first question where the present age of gkes is 42 years so here is the second question so the ratio between the present age of A and D is a is to B and the present age of C is 4 years less than that of a so the ratio between the age of a 4 years before and the age of B after 4 years is 1 is to2 and the average age of a b c d is 33 see the average age of all the four of them is 33 years I think this is the clue here in the previous question even though they have given an average but that's not the direct clue but here it's a very direct clue the average age of a b c d that means all the 4 person average has been given so a b c and d divided by 4 is equals to 33 that means sum of all the four person ages will be 1 4 3 is are 12 remaining will be 132 32 years so 132 years will be sum of all the four person ages it's a direct clue what they have given in the question so now still some more points are reminding if the present age of D is 8 years less than the age of B and find the difference between the squares of A and B so friends finally our Target is to find what is their difference between the squares of Ages A and B okay so we have to find what is a and b age and we have to square the number and we need to find the difference so that is our Target here so now again we got this clue and we framed one equation here I think now after finding a value B value value C value D value either in X format or something like that when once you substitute all the values here we will definitely get one person age for sure so now let me move on to the first point so the ratio between the present age of A and D is a is to B okay so what they saying is the ratio between okay A and B they are considering it as small a and small B okay so leave that next point so the ratio between so when just look at the point here third point the ratio between the age of a 4 years before right and the age of B 4 years after 4 years so before 4 years after 4 years ratio what they have given is 1 is to2 so 1 is to2 is the ratio what they have given so that means we can better assume the value as a as X A's age as x b age will be 2x right so now according to the question what they are saying is so this ratio value what they have given us ratio between the age of a 4 years before so that means 4 years before the age of the a is X so now the present age of a so present age of a will be x + 4 that me yes or no so now the second person present age of B so similarly what they have given us the present age of B 2x after 4 years they have given that means you have to subtract four so 2x- of 4 so this will be the present age of B so this will be the present age of a according to the third line of the question so what they have given us ratio between the age of a 4 years before so 4 years before and we bring the present age that is for a and 4 years after B age ratio has been given so present age of B will be 2x - 4 so by using the third point we have found the present age of a and present age of B so I think we can substitute for A and B now C and D is alone missing so what they have still some so many points are there in the question right so what they have given us present age of C is 4 years less than that of a so present age of C is 4 years less than that of a so A's age is how much x + 4 so present age of C is 4 years less that means you have to subtract four that means present age of C will be X so present age of C is X present age of B will be 2x - 4 present age of a will be x + 4 so still we have to find what is the present age of D so what all the mining points what they have given us if the present age of D that point is also given if the present age of D is 8 years less than the present age of B so present age of D is 8 years less than the present age of B so 2x - 4 is the present age of B so what they have given is 8 years less that means 8 years you have to subtract it subtract 8 again so this will be 2x minus of 12 so 2x - of 12 will be the present age of D so now now we got all the four person present age and we know sum of all the four person ages will be 132 so substitute all the values here finally we will get the value of x so once you find the value of x finding a is easy and then we can solve the question easily so now we can substitute all the values here so this will be x + 4 so this will be 2x - 4 and this will be c will be x d will be 2x- of 12 is = to 132 so now 2 x 2 x 4x so this will be X 5x and here also we have X so total will be 6X so - 4 + 4 we can cancel it so similarly here we have - 12 so 6x - 12 is = to 132 so 6X is equal to 144 because when you bring this towards right hand side it becomes + 12 144 so X is equal to so 6 2 are 12 remaining will be 2 24 6 4 are 24 so finally we got the value of x equal to 24 so substitute here so 24 + 4 so 24 + 4 will be 28 so 28 is what the age the present age of the person a so present age of the person a is 28 so what they what we need to find here is our Target to find the A and B that means A and D initially they have given first line itself they have given the ratio between the percentage of A and D is a is to B right so d 2 2 x - 12 substitute X is equal to 24 here so 24 into 2 will be 48 so 48 - 12 resultant will be 36 so 36 28 36 so this will be the value of a small a this will be the value of small B right don't take B value because they are saying the small b as D value right DH so now I think we can cancel this on 7 4 are 28 9 4 are 36 so 7 is to 9 so this will be the value of a and this will be the value of B so finally we found the value of a and b at last this is not the final answer because at last what they are saying is squares of their difference so 7 Square 49 9 Square 81 81 - 49 will be uh 32 32 years so 32 years will be the difference so which will be the answer for this question right so friends again we are solving many question that is based on a concept of average because even when you see some of the difficult level data interpretation like problems on based Age based concept they will be giving you only this value this value will be given in the chart mostly a value B value C value will be missing D value will be given and the average will be given so what we need to do is initially we need to find all the sum of their present age of a family and then after finding it we frame a equation like this to solve the data interpretation which was asked in 2017 I think so sorry so I'm sorry so 2017 I think so in SBA po I don't know exactly which exam it is they have asked one da that is based on problems on ages that to based on an average concept if you if you get a chance look at the question paper right so this will be the answer for the second question third question so the present age of a is 20% more than the present age of c and the age of B 8 years is 80% more than the present age of C so the the percent AG of a as well as B age is compared with the percentage of C but not directly given they have given in terms of percentages when compared to C A is 20% more when compared to C where B is 80% more so those values are given in terms of percentages so second point the ratio between the present age of D and e is 4 is to3 and the present age of C 8 years more than the age of D at the time so the present age of e is half of the age of a at that time find the average age of a c d together so friends our Target is to find the average age of three person that is a c and d together that means we don't they're not talking about B we need to add only the three person ages and we need to find the average of them so now according to the first point of the question where the age of a present age of A and B age that is after 8 years is compared with the age of present age of C that is 80% more so what I can do is so first we can assume a b c here so we can take the C's age as 100 percentage why because they are comparing A and B with the c so we can consider the c age present age this will be the present age present age of C is 100% now what about a so a will be 20% more that means a present age will be 120% right and what about B here according to the question 80% more that means 180% so we can cancel all the percentage zeros here so finally we will get 12 is to 18 is to 10 again we can cancel it on two table so this will be five cancel it on two Table 9 6 so 6 is 9 is 5 is the ages ratio of a b and C friends look at the question carefully so the present age of a that means the present age of a will be 6X so present age of a is 6X and present age of C will be 5x but B perent age is not given right what they saying is the age of B after 8 years so after 8 years ratio has been given so present age of B will be 9 xus of 8 so friends understood or not this will be the present age of a present age of c and this will be the present age of B so present age 9x - 8 6X and 5x so now still more lot more points are there so because we didn't find the exact age of all the person so let's let's read remaining point of the questions the present age of C is 8 years more than the age of D at the time so what they saying is the present age of C right so present age of C is 8 years more than the present age of D at the time so D we don't know what about the age of D plus d + 8 8 years more so present age of C will be 8 years more than the age of the D at that time so age of the D is unknown so we already know that the present age of C is 5X so D will be 5x minus of 8 so this will be the D's present age so a b c d so finally we found all the person ages so one point reminding the ratio between the perent AG of d and e is 4 is to3 so d and e okay so e what they have given us some point have given right the present age of e is half of the age of a so present age of e is half of the age of a so a is how much 6X then e will be how much 3x because half of the age of a will be the present age of e so finally I think we found all the four person present age so now according to the question what they have given us they have given one ratio value so the ratio between the present age of d and e is 4 is3 so d and e the ratio is 4 is3 and we know that the E's present age is how much 3x so e present age will be 3x is equal to 4X 3 but D present age will not be this because 8 years ago what they have given is the D's percentage 5x - 8 according to the question is 5x - 8 will be T's present age so present age this will be the present age this is not the present age we have substituted the C value here so that we bring the age of the person D to the per age that is 5x - 8 perent age of e will be 3x and the ratio what they have given is 4 is 3 so cross multiply it 5 into 3 is 15 x 24 12 x so this will be 3x = 24 x = 8 so finally we got the Val Val of X is equal to 8 so once we got one value finding all the remaining value is easy so why because all the value we have assumed it as X so once you substitute the value of x you will get the exact age of all the person so now according to the question our Target is to find what is the average age of a CD that is this value this value and D value this value right so 86 are so 8 5 are 40 so now 8 substitute 8 here 8 5 are 40 so 40 - 8 so 40 - 8 will be 32 so 4 8 11 120 120 divided by 3 will be 40 years because we need to find an average so divide by 3 so resultant will be 40 years so 40 years will be the average of the 3 person what they have given in the question right so friends be very careful right so because each and every point in the question is important mostly in the mains level question none of the point will be directly given everything will be either in a Twist format like percentage a ratio so be careful while writing the percentage alone because when you consider this 9x has a percentage then the complete question will be wrong so that's the reason read the question very slowly so a percentage is 20 per more than c b 8 years after 8 years they have given this ratio which is 80% more than C so here this value is not the percentage of B 9x - 8 will be the percentage of B so C percentage has been Direct ly given we have considered it so similarly D AG was not given but C percentage is equals to 8 years more than D age at the time that means the percentage so percentage of D is equal to 5x minus of 8 so we found all the remaining person ages in the form of X and then we have found the average right so friends now I will give you two question as a test question so same including this three question also three question including another two question so totally five five question two new question I will give give you as a test solution will also be there you can after writing a test you can see the solution so don't forget to write the test right so test will more and more important I have not given less time on the test five question 45 minutes 40 minutes you have one question you can take more than seven or 8 minutes to solve so practice like this practice very slowly again speed is not at all important in the mains exam only each and every step you need to write correctly that is the most important thing so practice more I will give you I will post you more videos on Main series as well as I will give you more test do not forget to write the test that's what I'm repeatedly saying it only then you will get a practice so friends thank you so much for watching this video and if you really like it share the video to your friends those are preparing for the mains exams so thank you so much bye,unknown
wdWWktG27AI,so what will be the ratio of simple interest earned by the certain amount at the same rate of interest for 6 years and for 9 years so when just listen carefully our Target is to find what is the ratio of simple interest it's a simple there are two simple interest because one they have calculated interest for 6 years and 9 years so we have to find the ratio for simple interest one and simple interest two so now according to the question certain amount that means the principal was not given so let's assume p as the principal rate of interest is also not given but they have given the same rate of interest so let's assume the rate of interest as R so simple interest formula PN R ided 100 so ratio PN r divided by 100 according to the question we can cancel principle and principle rate of interest both are same we can cancel it only the years are different so 6 ID 100 is to 9 / 100 we we can cancel 100 and 100 here so 6 is to 9 still we can cancel it on three table 2 is to 3 so the ratio of simple interest is 2 is to three,unknown
lXeSKA6TKH0,"a sum of rupees 12,500 amounts to 15,500 in 4 years at the rate of interest simple interest find the rate of interest so here our Target is to find the rate of interest at some rate of interest this amount 12,500 becomes 15,500 that means this 15,500 is the overall amount the amount what they have invested is 12,500 in 4 years this amount becomes this much so our Target is to find what will be the rate of interest here so 12,500 becomes 15,500 in 4 years that means the difference 12,500 difference 15,500 will be 3,000 so simple interest for 4 years which is 3,000 right so we know the basic formula simple interest is equals to PNR by 100 so simple interest will be 3,000 principal what they have invested is 12,500 number of years is four rate of interest what we need to find in the question so we can cancel two 0 2 0 here so similarly we can cancel 1 4 are 4 or we can cancel it on two table which becomes 125 * 3 * so this becomes 6 percentage so answer for this question is 6 percentage",unknown
ng5Boiykdjo,so what sum of money will amount to rupees 520 in 5 years and rupees 568 in 7 years at the simple interest see our Target is to find what is the sum of money will amounts to so our Target is to find the principal so what they have given is the total amount right in the total amount a in 5 year is 520 so the total amount in 7 year it becomes 568 so only two data they have given by using the two data our Target is to find what is the principle so just listen carefully in 5 years the total amount is 520 in 7 years the total amount is 568 what is the difference here so difference between 5 and 7 will be 2 year so 2 year the interest difference is 48 rupees so what about one year so one year will be 24 that means in one year the interest alone is 24 rupees because we have calculated the difference that means the interest difference so for 2 year the interest difference is 48 for one year the interest difference is 54 so now only we can find what is the interest for 5 years which is 120 so 120 is the interest for 5 years the overall amount for 5 years is 520 When you subtract the overall amount and interest we will get the principal so 520 minus 120 will be 400 which will be the Principal so basic concept of simple interest right so we have the overall amount we know the difference we know one year interest by using that we found what is 5 years so by using the 5 years we subtracted the overall and the interest amount for five years resultant will be the Principal,unknown
vJswCWf_z3E,so friends this series is specially made for the bank exam aspirants those who are going for the mains exam like SBO Mains ibbs Mains RBA Mains so for those students as well as for students those who are preparing for the cat exams so this series is specially made for you and second importantly after watching this video do not forget to take the test so test is more and more important so on the website orals on the mobile application you can able to see inside quantitative aptitude So Below the data interpretation Mains level so now you can able to see quantitative aptitude Mains so there inside it after posting every topic we will give you a test at the end of the video every video I will be telling you how the test works and how many questions I have given the test so based upon that the test will be added on the package so do not forget to write the test after watching the video so now let me move on to the Mains level series on quantitative aptitude first of all thanks for being here in my YouTube channel so friends here is the second video on quantitative aptitude on the main series that is on the topic problems on ages so do not forget to watch the first video problems on ages I have taught you three question and then two question test so similarly in this video also we will be solving questions on problems on ages At Last I will be giving you two question as a test so kindly if you watch the first video go and watch the first video learn the problems how we are going to solve and what level the questions will be everything and then come and watch this second video so now let me move on to the second set of questions on problems on ages first question so the ratio between the ages of A and B 8 years ends is 13 is to 10 and the ratio between the ages of b and a 8 years ago is 2 is to 3 so the age of a 4 years ago is same as the age of D after 4 years ends the present age of D is 50% more than the present age of C 4 years ago find the average age of a b c d together so while reading a question it feels like little bit confusing because none of the value was directly given 8 years ago 5 years ends so they're talking about one data about past one data about future but what is our final Target our final Target to find the average age of all the four person that means we have to find what is the age of a b c and d and then we have to divide by four that will be the final answer so now getting to the first line so read step by step frame a equation I have told you many times whenever you're are going to equate any equation even in the previous video I've told it right so whenever you're going to equate any equation make sure that both the equations should either past or present or future right make them to bring on the same thing and then solve the question so now according to the first point the ratio between the age of A and B 8 years ends that means they're talking about the future so future ratio has been given right so future ratio what they have given us 13 is to 10 yes so 13 is to 10 that is 8 years ends that means after 8 years they're talking about the future and the second point and this ratio what they have given is for a is to B so now what is the next point and the and the ratio between b and a 8 years ago just listen the word carefully this is also a is to B ratio the second line also what they have given is the ratio of B is to a that is 8 years ago that means so present is not given but they are talking about the past on the second line so a is to B ratio they have given it as B is to a we can take it as a is to B which is 3 is2 so this happens 8 years ago that means they are talking about the past so here they are talking about the past right and here they are talking about the future and both person are not a different person both are same here also a is to B here also a is to B so what you can do here is it is easy to find what is the value of any one person why because if you assume these two person a age future age is 139 X and 10 x you can easily frame a equation to the past and we can find the answer or else you can take it as 3x and 2x and bring to the Future and you can frame the equation it's completely upon your wish either you can go with the reverse or you can go with the forward but you will get surely you will get value of x so what I'm going to do is from the past I'm going from the future I'm going to the past so future age of a is how much 13x right so 13x minus 8 to the present - 8 to the past which becomes this ratio that means 13x minus of 16 divided by second person 10 x minus of 16 so now these two person ages is in the past so past 8 years back what is the ratio 3 is to2 so friends understood or not how I wrote this right so either you wish you can from this point for example if you can assume 3x + 16 2x + 16 is = to 13 to 10 way you can solve the equation so now according to the first two point we are going to solve this and we are going to find what is the value of x here so 13 into 2 will be 26 x so this will be 32 is equal to 30 x minus of sorry yes we can multiply it right so minus of 16 into 3 will be 48 so now 30X 26x so this will be 4X right so 4X is equals to bring this towards left hand side plus 48 so this will be 16 so finally we got X is equal to 4 so now what we got here is the value of x is equals to 4 so once you find one value finding the exact age of all the person is easy why because we know 13 is 2 10 is 8 years back 8 years after so now by using x equal to 4 you can easily find X into 4 that is 10 into 4 will be 40 so 40 is the age of the person B 8 years ends after 8 years so similarly 13 into 4 so 52 so 52 is the age of a that is 8 years after ends so this will be the age of B so now if you need to bring them to the a page to the present you have to subtract it by eight so resultant will be a and b so finally by using the first two lines we have framed and we framed a equation to find the value of x so after finding the value of x we found what is the person age of a and age of B so now getting to the remaining Point still we need to find what is C and D still lot more to find here so now so what we can do here is next point the age of a 4 years ago just listen carefully the age of a 4 years ago is same as the age of D after 4 years ends so what they are saying is age of a so age of a 4 years ago that means they're talking about the past so four years ago is equals to age of D four years ends so friends understood or not age of a 4 years ago is equals to age of D four years ends they're talking about the future here they're talking about the past so minus of four plus of four so now listen one point carefully here the A's age is 52 actually we have to bring the age to the present that means you have to subtract 8 if you subtract 8 from 52 resultant will be 44 so 44 will be the the age of the person a similarly what is the age of the person B is you have to subtract 8 resultant will be 32 so 32 will be age of the person B that is present age of the person B so now according to the question we know value of a is 44 so sub subtract here 44 - 4 is = to D + 4 when you subtract here which becomes 40 so 40 - 4 which is 36 so the age of the person D is 36 so now we found the person D's age A's age and B's age so now our Target is to find the last person that is C's age next Point what they are saying is the present age of D okay the present age of D is 36 is 50% more than the age of C so this age of D is 50% Ag More than the age of C right 4 years ago so 4 years ago means that talking about the past so we already know that the a D's age is 36 C's age 4 years ago so we don't know what about the C's age which is 4 years ago minus of 4 is equals to just read the word carefully 50% more than that means when compare to C where the person D is 50% more that means 150 divided by 100 so now we can cancel 0 0 here and we can cancel it on 5 3 is are 15 5 2 is are 10 so 1 3 is are 3 12 3 is are 36 so now this will be c - 4 is equal to 24 so C is equal to 28 so finally we got the age of all the four person so C is equal to 28 a = to 44 B = to 32 and D equal to 36 so now according to the question we have to add all the value and we need to find the average right so when you add for 28 44 35 years right so 35 years is the average so average of all the 4 person so according to the question find the average of a b c and d together so which will be 35 years so this will be the answer for the first question right so friends understood or not be slow very slow don't be too fast you will make a mistake definitely there is more chance of making a mistake and if you are preparing for and you're are going for any Mains level competitive exams definitely speed is not at all needed right at after solving 7 or 10 minutes even you're taking 10 minutes to solve the question at last you should get the final answer after 10 minutes if you are struggling to get the final answer then while preparing itself you have made some mistake that is not the right way to learn right so learn very slow slowly prelims you can be fast you should not solve like this in the prelims exam you have to solve it little bit fastly but for the mains exam time or nothing is needed so be slow 7 take 7 minutes more than 7 minutes it's okay but you should get the final answer correctly that is most important here right so friends always remember that there will be some clue in the question definitely there will be either any one Clues will be given in the question you have to rightly point out the clue and you have to frame the equation so whenever you frame a equation that what I'm repeatedly saying it whenever you frame a equation make sure both the values should be either past or present or future and then solve the equation you will get definitely one value if you got one value or any one person age finding all the remaining person age will be easy right so that's the thing you should always Target first to find any one person age so now answer for the last first question on this video is 35 years so here is the second question so the ratio between the present age of anel and B is 8 is9 and the present age of s is 12 years younger than annel so the ratio between the present age of San and Davis is 4 is to 5 and the ratio between the age of anel 8 years ago and present age of divis is 8 is to9 the average age of B is and there was together 3 years ago how much more or less than the unel 2 years ends a very interesting question you can see again mainly Mains exam question will be like this you can't able to understand anything but one thing you need to remember is be very slow solve step by step right so uh some students will have a doubt I I hope in the previous question first question I have solved and I found the answer 35 years but remember one thing even while finding I I just found that 35 years in a mind calculation right but when you add all the values what I mentioned here you will not get 35 so remember one thing the C value what I got here is 28 years but the C value what I have written is 4 years back we need to make sure that while even while finding a average also all the four person age should be present so see I have written here as 28 I think so but actually you need to bring them to their age to the present so which which means the c age will be 24 and then add and divide by four you will get answer 35 years I hope some students can have a doubt just just uh I just want to uh teach that year so only I told you always remember that even while finding average also make sure that all the four person age should be either present or past or future one person should not be present and another person age should not be past you can't able to take average like that right so uh it's not a mistake on the previous question you have to understand right so that's the thing I just want to mention here before solving the second question okay sorry let's move on to this question two so the ratio between average age of Anil and B is 8 is to9 okay so what they have given us first they are talking about there are so many person anel Bey deis and then uh some more persons are there right senin okay so let let's solve the question step by step based upon the question value what they have given so first they are talking about the present age of two person right so present age of Anil and beo so Anil as well as Bey the person age will be 8 is to 9 so that means we can take the percentage of Anil as 8X and Bey as 9x based upon the requirement of the question so second point and the present age of Ain is 12 years younger than Anil that means what is called as anger anger means when compared to anel he was like 12 years you have to subtract from the anels age so here actually cin H so cin H is equals to what they are saying is 12 years younger than anel we already know that Anil percentage we have considered it as 8X so 8X minus of 12 why minus of 12 because s is younger right he's not older if he is older we have to add 12 is younger than anel so we have subtracted by 12 so this will be the present age of sin right and uh this will be the present age of anel and Bey okay so what about the next point the ratio between the present age of San and Davis so what they g s and Davis the ratio has been given which is 4 is to 5 so this will be the present age of San and Davis I don't know whether I'm pronouncing the name correctly or not okay anyway C and D right so C and D present age ratio is 4 is to 5 and we already know that the cin percentage is how much 8x - 12 and here they have given a ratio for cin and Davis is 4 is 5 so this value is also present so now it is easy to write a equation so s four part so s four part is equal to 8x - 12 what about D 5 part is equals to question mark so let's cross multiply it so uh when once you cross multiply this so this will be four of right is equals to 8 5 are 40x so minus of 60 yes or no right so 85 are 40 12 into 5 60 so check whether we can cancel it so D is equals to so this can be written as 10 x so minus of 1 4 are 4 15 so finally the D present age that is deis present age s and deis so deis percentage is 10 x - 15 so sinin percentage will be 8 x - 12 Anil percentage is 8x B percentage is 9x so finally we found all the four person still one more person is there okay so let me talk about later on so now according to the question value we found all the four person perent age next point so and the ratio between the age of anel 8 years ago so anel age is 8x 8 years ago that means 8x - 8 right so 8 years ago go and the present age of divis so present age of divis is how much 10 x - 15 so 10 x - 15 this will be the present age of divice and 8 years ago this is the Pres age of unel so 8 x - 8 10 x - 15 what they have given the ratio which is 8 is to 9 is 8 is to 9 so now it is easy so once they have given this equation it is easy to find one value x value once you find the X we can able to find all the remaining person ages first let we Target and we can find what is the value of x here so 72x minus of 72 is equal to 80x right so minus of 8 5 are 40 which is 120 so now 80x 72x so this will be 8X right so when you bring this 70 120 towards left hand side plus 120 so 20 here we have 28 which is 48 so 8 6 are 48 so finally we got the value of x is equals to 6 so once you got the value of one person finding all the remaining person percentage is easy because we know anal percentage is 8x 8 6 are 48 so this will be the anel's presentent AG what about B 9 6 are 54 so next will be S so Cen is X is equal to 6 so 8 6 are 48 so 48 minus of 12 so this will be 26 right sorry 36 s so next person is how much so this person de so 60 - 15 so this will be 45 right so finally we got all the four percentage so still some more point they have given in the question right so what they have given us the average age of byy sinin and de together 3 years ago so 3 years ago that means you have to find the average age of all the three person that is 3 years ago okay so what we can do is we can first find the average minus of three minus of minus of three because three years ago for each and every person right so now let's we take B so B is how much 54 so 3 years ago that means his age will be 51 so similarly the next person is uh cin so cin per age is how much 36 3 years ago which is 33 so similarly the last person is deis together so deis is how much 45 so 45 3 years ago that will be 42 so divided by 3 so 3 4 5 6 so 4 9 12 126 ID by 3 so which will be 42 so 42 is what so 42 will be average age of all the three person 3 years ago right so next what they are saying is and the and the age of anel 2 years ends Anil is how much year 48 right so anel 2 years ends that means you have to add two to the age so 48 + 2 will be 50 so now 50 is the anal 42 we have to find the difference which means 8 years so answer for the question is 8 years our Target is to find how much more or less that means the age difference so average we found is 42 until 2 years ends this is the present AG so 2 years ends will be 50 so 50 minus 42 resultant will be 8 years so 8 years is the answer for this question right so everything here is just how you understand the question right have you understand the question and and what is the strong Basics what we learned that is most most important here without knowing the basics you can't able to touch this question first thing that's what I'm repeatedly every time I usually say it learn the basics only Basics will help you only if you strong in the basics even without knowing the basics just like that learning a formula you can crack the prelims but Mains not at all right not at all without knowing just knowing all the formulas on quantitative aptitude you can't able to clear it right so only if you know the basics properly you can able to clear the exams right so now this will be the answer for the questions right so friends understood so initially while reading the question I can't able to understand anything really really I can't able to understand anything but when you go step by step process always first after reading a question try to find out any clue I can't able to find any clue here even in the previous question I can't able to find any clue but what we need to find here is important so first we need to find the average of all the three person and then anel so we need to find the difference that means only if you know all the person ages you can able to find this answer so I have read the question step by step for First Step what value they have given Second Step what value they have given solving in a step by step it is easy to find out the answer question number three so the ratio between the age of x 3 years ends and the age of y 6 years ago is 11 is to 7 and the ratio between the age of Y after 5 years and the age of Zed after 3 years is 4 is to3 so the percentage of Y is 90% the percentage of X and the difference between the age of X and Y is same as the age of Z and W so who is older than Z that means the person W is older than Z right so find the Pres age of X and W 2 years ago okay so very interesting question here what is our Target our Target is to find the average age of X and W that is 2 years ago so we have to find what is the age of X and W that is our ultimate goal here after reading this question again none of the value was directly given but one sentence alone feel me like a clue the present age of Y is 9 percentage so it's an exact point they are comparing the data of 2 person that is when compare 2 x where Y is 90% so I think when you use x as 100 percentage then y will be 90 I think we can frame some sort of equation here by using the data okay so so we can solve step by step right read the first sentence of the question frame a equation like that we can proceed on that way so the ratio between the age of X after 3 years that means they're talking about the future and the y 6 years ago they talking about the past let we bring both the person age to the present right and then we can frame a equation just look at the word carefully we know that the ratio was given which is 11 is 7 so 11 is to 7 is the ratio let's assume this as 11x and this will be 7 x right so 7x and 11x because they have given in the term of ratio so now according to the question we know that the ratio between the age of X after 3 years that means they have given the future let bring the xh to the present so when you bring the xh to the present that is 11 xus 3 so this will be the X present age so similarly the second person is y so y present age so 7x and what they talking about this ratio value what they have given is 6 years 6 years ago that means the they are they have given the past bring them to the present that means plus 6 so 7 x + 6 this will be the present age of Y and this will be the present age of X because they have given the past age and one age that was given in the future so we bought both the person age to the present so now present age of X has been ref found and present age of Y is this equation right so now what is the second point they have given us the ratio between the age of Y so ratio between mean age of Y after 5 years the age of X after 3 years we actually don't know what is the age of Z here we know what is X and Y right so here this will be the X percentage okay so better leave that point because we don't know what is the exact value of X and Y and Z somewhere are talking about it leave the point that we move on to the next point so next point is the percentage of Y so percentage of Y is 90% the percentage of X so what does it mean is if when you take X is to Y ratio right if x is 100 percentage then what about y y will be 90% because they have mentioned it you can see the perent AG of Y is 90% the percentage of X when you assume X as 100 y will be 90 and we already know that X is 11 x - 3 so 11 x - 3 is X Y will be 7 x + 6 is y is equal to 10 / 9 we can cancel 0 0 so 10 by 9 so this will be 99 x - of 27 is equal to 70 x + 60 so this will be when you bring 70 towards left hand side this will be 29x is equals to 6 78 87 so this will be like uh three times 6 7 8 so x equals to 3 so finally by using the small clue right so initially I have told you this can be the clue why because they have given one point directly so by using the point we equated both the equation and we found what is the value of x so just now I've told you many times I'm telling this once you find one value x value and you can easily find out all the person percentage so we found X is equals to 3 by using the data we can easily find what is the percentage of X so 11 into is 33 33 - 3 will be 30 so 30 will be the percentage of X so similarly 7 3 are 21 so 21 + 6 will be 27 so 27 is the present age of Y so we found what is the present age of X and present age of Y so now so now according to the question what they said is the second second Point only because of not having a exact value of y we didn't read the second sentence so now look at the second sentence the ratio between y after 5 years just look at the point carefully the ratio between y after 5 years y is how much 27 years after 5 years that means 27 + 5 resultant will be 32 so 32 years what they are saying is after five and the age of Z after 3 years we don't know what is age of Z so age of Z after 3 years is in the ratio 4 is to3 so these two value ratio is 4 is to3 and we know already know that 4 is to3 is y z ratio and Y value we know that which is 32 that means four part is equals to 32 so three part Z is equals to how much that is z + 3 because three part they have given Z + 3 so now we can equate it so this becomes 4 Z + 12 4 into 3 will be 12 is equals to 96 so 4 Z isal to 96 - 12 resultant will be 84 so 4 Z is equal to 84 so Z is equal to 21 so finally we got the value of Z which is 21 so now according to the question we got x value we got y value as well as we got Z value still only one value is REM remaining which is W right so now let's see the what the remaining still we have some more points on the question so what they said is difference between X and Y is same so difference between X and Y so X and why age difference is how much 3 20 30 minus 27 the age difference is 3 so similarly here what they are saying is the difference between Z and W is also same so Z is 21 we don't know what about W but what they saying is the difference is same so difference should also be three because X and Y is three so this difference should also be three but remember one thing so this age can be 24 or 17 but they have given one point w who is older than Z so the person W is not younger who is older so definitely it will be 24 only then we can say the difference between both the value is three you can't write 17 here why because you can't write 18 here why because when you go with 18 then W will be younger than Z according to the question they have mentioned that W older than Z so Z older so that means w should be 24 so finally we got all the value right 24 21 x and y so all the values we got it so now according to the question our Target is to find the average percentage of X and W right that means 2 years ago so we have to subtract two right X is how much X is 30 so you have to subtract 2 30 - 2 which is 28 so similarly next is W right okay so w is how much 24 subtract 2 which is 22 so divided by 2 because we need to find an average so 50 by2 which is 25 years so answer for this question is 25 years again so be careful every time while equating and while finding an even an average see while finding average I have just cross checked one time whether I have taken an average for the present age if this value is for example I'm saying if this is a future value future age has been given the second person age should also be in future so year 28 which is the percent age so w is also percentage so always remember that both the value should be on the same age right so sorry friends so friend remember one thing I have solved this question very very slowly right you you should understand the way what how I am solving the question only because of that I'm just solving each and every step slowly so even if you are first time learning for the mains exam you can understand that how the mains level question is how you should solve it in a step by step and now I have given the same three question as a test remember one thing same three question what I solved in the video plus additional two new question as a test why because here we have solved a question very slowly step by step we have learned learned the sentence step by step we frame the equation and we simplify it but while writing the test don't do do like this be little bit fast right so this is the value what they so we can frame a equation so just solve the question same question fastly so that you will get that speed also right so even if you taking s or 8 minutes to solve a question you can able to solve within 6 minutes when you practice the test so that's the reason I have given already previous video also I have given two new question as a test here also in this video I have given two new question as a test so I have given the solution for this question also like this you can able to understand it right so do not forget to take the test after watching this video take your time after after 1 Hour 2 hours or uh you just take take one day of time tomorrow write the test the same three question with new two new question so that it becomes a great practice for you and every time you can write the test again and again so before going for any Mains exam just spend half an hour on each topic so similarly next T topic I will be posting on the videos so make sure to watch all the mains level series it will be on the playlist even I posted data interpretation also on my channel so start watching it start writing the test so that surely you can able to crack the mains exam right so friends thank you so much for watching this video and if you really like it share the video to your friends those who are preparing for the mains exam so thank you so much bye,unknown
HPQgyWBXtew,"the simple interest on a certain sum for 8 months at 4 percentage per anom is 129 less than the simple interest on a same sum see whenever i' I've told you while teaching simple interest itself whenever you find a word 129 less or 100 more 200 more that means the difference between two simple interest is 129 because one simple interest when compared to another which is 129 less that means the difference between simple interest 1 and simple interest 2 will be 129 so simple interest formula PNR / 100 difference of PNR ided 100 is equals to 129 so here they have invested a certain sum the principal was not given so let's take principal outside common so what about 100 we can take this 100 also common so now NR number of years so here according to the question they have given in terms of 8 months so we have to convert in terms of year 8 by 12 so this can be written as 8 / by 12 what about the rate of interest is 4 difference of similarly number of years is 15 months so 15 ided by 12 right sorry 15 ID by 12 into rate of interest according to the question 5 percentage is equals to 129 so we can take 12 outside so P ided by 120 0 so this will be 32 this will be 75 is equal to 129 so P / 120 into 43 is equal to 129 we can cancel this 3 times so principal is equals to 3,600 according to the question our Target is to find the sum so sum is 3,600 so always remember that whenever you find the word less or more definitely the difference has been given",unknown
XSNfI2EgOKg,so friends this series is specially made for the bank exam aspirants those who are going for the mains exam like SBO Mains ibbs Mains RBA Mains so for those students as well as for students those who are preparing for the cat exams so this series is specially made for you and second importantly after watching this video do not forget to take the test so test is more and more important so on the website orals on the mobile application you can able to see inside quantitative aptitude So Below the data interpretation Mains level so now you can able to see quantitative aptitude Mains so there inside it after posting every topic we will give you a test at the end of the video every video I will be telling you how the test works and how many questions I have given the test so based upon that the test will be added on the package so do not forget to write the test after watching the video so now let me move on to the Mains level series on quantitative aptitude first of all thanks for being here in my YouTube channel so friends here is the first video on the main series on quantitative aptitude that is on the topic problems on ages so here we will be solving a Mains level question so here I'm not going to teach you the basics because I hope you already know the basics of problems on ages what is past future how to frame a equation everything so I don't want to waste your time directly let that we move on to all the question that we are going to solve in this video so before solving difficult level question on the topic problems on ages you have to keep one important point that while equating because most of the problems on ages question like difficult level question you can able to see that will be in the form of framing a equation so we frame a equation and then we equate the equation and then we will get x y z based upon the question while equating the either two person value or two person ages you have to be very careful on that point while equating any two person or the same person be mostly you have to remember one thing both the person age should be either present while equating I'm saying both the person age should be present or future or it should be past at any case do not equate one person present age equal to another person past age you cannot able to equate like that if you equate like that the equation will be completely wrong so if you are going to equate any equation on problems on ages make sure both the person age should be either present or past or future right so that is the most important thing in the difficult level question students used to make a mistake they take the present age of any one person and second person past age and they try to equate it so while equating you will get an equation but the problem is that equation whether you will take it as a past or you will take it as a present so we can't able to identify that so be careful while equating you have to make sure either the same person or different person but the age should be present both the person age should be present or past or future that is most important right so I'm not going to uh deeply on the basics let me move on to all the question on the first video for the mains level series question number one so the ratio between the ages of A and B 4 years later is 5 is to 4 so later means they're talking about the future and the age of C 8 years ago was 20% more than the age of B at that time so the age of D is equals to sum of percentage of c and percentage of B and the sum of present age of A and C is 68 years find the ratio between the age of a 3 years later and age of D 12 years ago right so after reading a question I can a to see totally there are four person A B C D and what is our final Target our final Target to find the ratio of the person a and of the person D at some case either they're talking about a 3 years later and D 12 years ago past and the future our Target is to find the ratio but none of the value was directly given here so be very slow speed or nothing is important here we have to get the final answer correctly that is our Target right so first the ratio between ages of A and B 4 years later is 5 is 4 so they are talking about later that means they're talking about the future so there are two person ages that is a is to B how many years back four years not eight later four years future right which is in the ratio 5 is 4 so let's take the future age of a is equals to 5x right so B is equals to 4X so now what we can do here is we can bring the 4 years later that means the future age was given we can bring to the present so present age of both the person A and B is equal to 5x - 4 B is equal to 4x - 4 so friends understood so this is the first step of the question so initially what I did is I bought 2 person age to the present what about the next point the age of C 8 years ago they're talking about the past right so 8 years ago 20 20 percentage more than the age of B at the time so now what they talking is they are talking about C and B that is C is to B ratio has been given so what they are saying is where the person C 8 years ago was 20% more than b when compared to b c is 20% more so what I can do here is I can take B is to C as if B is 100 what about c c will be 120 because 20% more so we can cancel this this and we can 5 2 is are 10 6 2 is are 12 so finally we got the ratio B is to C is 5 is 6 so now according to the qu question where both the person age was given that is 8 years ago they're talking about the past say so 8 years ago now let we bring both the person age to the present so present age of B and C so first person B present age is 5 Y and their age was 8 years ago this value has been given so Plus 8 so resultant will be the present age of the person B so what about the present age of the person c will be 6 y + 8 so friends finally we got the present age of A and B present age of B and C so by using both the lines that is first two data what they have given in the question we frame the equation and then we bought all the person age to the present so now equating part will be easy that's the reason I always say bring all the person age to the present or bring all the ages to the past or future make it on the same area and then equate it right so now what is the third point the age of D is equals to sum of c and b so sum of c and b right when you add C and B that should be the age of d right so D is equals to sum of c and b okay let me add and we can find the answer what about next Point sum of present age of A and C is 68 years okay okay so sum of a and C so A and C is 68 years right what about a here according to the question 5x - 4 is a what about C 6 y + 8 is equals to what they have given us 68 years so 68 years so 5x + 6 y so this will be + 4 is = to 68 so 5x + 6 Y is = 64 so this act as a first equation right so this will be the first equation according to the question what they have said is sum of the present age of A and C so A and C sum of their present age that is careful right so sum of their present age of a and c will be 68 and just friends listen carefully here based upon the two data what they have given in the question so here we know what is B 4x - 4 present age here also we know B that is present AG just now I have told you right always remember that if you are going to equate any two equation of a same person or a different person keep that in mind both the person age should be in the present so let's take both the person age and we can equate it so 4x - 4 right so what about the second person here is equals to 5 y + 8 so friends understood so 4X minus of 5 Y is = 8 + 4 which is 12 now 4x - of 5 y is equals to 12 so we can assume this as equation 2 because we have already taken this as equation 1 so this will be equation 2 so now we have to solve both the equation to get what is the value of X and Y so what we can do here is first uh we can I think we can take the first equation that is 5x + 6 Y is = to 64 so what about the second equation so 4X minus of 5 Y is equal to 12 so now what I can do here is uh I can okay I can just multiply this by 4 5 so 5 into 4 is 20x this will be 24 Y is equals to 4 4 are 16 remaining will be 1 6 4 are 24 1 25 so similarly multiply this by 5 20x minus of 25 Y is equals to 60 so now minus plus and minus so you can cancel it so 25 this will be 49 y so 49 Y is equals to 1 196 or 194 right so 194 so now we got what is the value of x here so based upon that we need to solve the question right so now after finding the value of y you have to substitute here to find what is the value of x right so the value of y will be 16 9 4 are 36 sorry I'm six here so which will be 36 Y is equal to 4 so substitute Y is equal to 4 in any of the equation so if I substitute Y is equal to 4 here 6 4 are 24 so this becomes 8 5 are 40 so X is equals to 8 so friend finally we got the value of x and the value of y so once you got the value of X and Y we can easily find what is the A's percentage B's percentage C's percentage everything is easy right so that is our Target this part alone is important how I equate both the person equation see this part is most important why because this part area is not given in the question we just solve this area by using the data what we found in the question right so why I equated both the person AG because by using the First Data we know what is the B's percentage by using the second data we know what is B's percentage so in both the data we have B present AG so we can equate both the person age to get one equation so that's what I did here and then we framed the second equation first equation data was already given in the question so we solved both the equation to get what is the value of x and what is the value of y so now according to the question what they were asking us they are asking about the ratio of a and C so now just see substitute the value of x here we will get what is the value of a that is A's per age so so a is equals to when you substitute X is equal to 8 so 8 into 8 5 are 40 so 40 - 4 will be 36 that means A's present age will be 36 so what about B substitute X is equal to 4 sorry X is equal to 8 so 8 4 are 32 32 - 4 will be 28 so B present age will be 28 and what about C we know value of y is equal to 4 so 6 4 are 24 so 24 + 8 will be 32 so CH H will be 32 so finally we got the value of a value of B and the value of C that is all the three person present age so now according to the question so question what they're asking us is find the ratio between the age of a 3 years later so age of a 3 years later that means from 36 3 years later that means you have to add three 36 + 3 will be 39 so a age will be 30 9 so ratio to the age of D 12 years ago that means we have to find the D's age here D percentage is unknown but they have given a point that the age of D is equal to sum of c and b so when you add C and B resultant will be the age of D so when you add 30 50 60 so 60 will be the age of the person D so now while finding the ratio we have to write the age of D 12 years ago that means 60 - 12 so 6 60 - 12 will be 48 so 48 will be the age of the person D so now try to cancel it so this becomes when you cancel this on three table 1 3 is are 3 3 3 is are 9 1 3 is are 3 6 3 is are 18 so finally answer for this question is 13 is to 16 so friends understood or not right so remember one thing right the the question concept is really easy to understand some question we you can't able to even understand what they are saying but here each and every point is not directly given but clearly given right what person age is compared to which person and some of which two person AG is equals to which person so all the data was clearly given so friends always remember that definitely the level of the question will be more than this in your competitive exam recent time but you have to know some of the important Logics to solve the question so this value what we did they have given in the question we framed percentage second data we framed the percentage so now based upon both the datas we know in both the data we have the value of B so I have equated the both the person present age and then I framed one equation and this equation they have already given in the question itself so we framed two equation by solving it we have got X and Y after finding X and Y so we can easily find what is the percentage of all the three person so now according to the question we have found the ratio so which is the answer for the first question so here is the second question so the ratio between the age of a 4 years ago and the age of c 2 years ago is 5 is to3 and the ratio between the age of B and age of D after 6 years is 8 is5 so the present age of a is double the age of D after 3 years and the average age of all of them is 38 years so the percentage of B is what percentage more or less the percentage of C after 4 years okay so very interesting question I think all the ratio value has been directly given right there is no twist in the question you can able to see a and C ratio has been given second point B and D ratio has been given so most of the ratio value has been given but one what is our Target our Target is to find how much the age of a b is more or less than C that is Formula x - y / Y into 100 so basic formula so one important Point here you have to remember that just see the point average age of all of them that means all the four person ages I think totally there are a to d four person so a b c d / by 4 is equals to 38 I think only by using using that small clue we can able to find one person exact age right other than that we can't able to find it because all the values are ratio keep that in mind all the value what they have given in ratio we can't able to find the exact value so if you need to find one person if you find one person age finding all is easy for finding that one person age you have to get that important point average age of all of them I think that is the only clue here now let's start framing the equation no other way so the ratio between a ages of a 4 years ago that means 4 years back so let's let's take the age of the person a as a itself so a minus 4 because 4 years back and the C before 2 years so C Age 2 years back so C minus 2 so what is the ratio what they have given is 5 5 is 3 that means 5 by3 so friends understood or not so a A's Age 4 year back C is Age 2 year back is equals to 5 is to 3 that means 5 by 3 so first let me solve it so this becomes 3 a is equal to 4 3 is are 12 so 5 C minus of 10 so 3 a is equals to so 5 C + 2 so a is equal to 5 C + 2 / 3 so let me take this as equation number one so friends understood what I did either you can find the C value or you can find a value whatever be that is your wish so finally we are going to substitute A + B + C+ d ided by 4 is equal to 38 that's it so next point so next Point what they have given us ratio between the age of B and D after 6 years okay so both the person age after 6 years so B and D so b + 6 after 6 years and D so D + 6 after 6 years what is the ratio they have given is 8 is 5 that means 8 by 5 so what I can do is similarly we can cross multiply it 5 b + 6 5 are 30 is = to 8 D 48 so now 5 b is equal to 8 D 48 - 30 48 - 30 will be 18 so + 18 so B is equal to 8 D + 18 / by 5 so let me take this as equation number two right so 8 D + 18 / 5 is equals to equation number two because here by by using the First Data we we found what is the value of a by solving the second data we found what is the value of B so now our final Target to find the value of C right so that's it so what about C here the present age of a is double the age of D after 3 years present age of a a is double the age of D that means a is a is to d h right so a is to DH will be 2 is to 1 because when compared to D A's age is double that means a is to D is equals to 2 is to 1 right so now what they have given is another important Point what they have given is a is double the age of D after 3 years that means so a divided by after 3 years of DH D + 3 is = 2 by 1 so now let me solve it so this will be a is equal to 2D + 6 this can be taken as equation number three okay so I think uh just just listen carefully friends we got the value of a right we got the value of B but we didn't get the value of C either we can equate here to find the value of C or else I can equate one and three because one equation is a is equal 2 3 equation is a is equals 2 so what I can do is I'm going to equate 1 and 3 what is 1 here 5 C + 2 / 3 what about third equation here 2D + 6 so now by solving this we can find what is the c right so 5 C + 2 is = to 6D + 18 so 5 C is = 6D + 16 so C is equal to 6D + 16 divided by 5 so friends finally I got the equation number four which means the C value so C is equals to 6D + 16 / 5 so finally I got all the person's ages because a value we found B value C value so D we can directly take it as D to find the average of them so according to the question they have given one of the important clue that a plus all the three person average that means divided by 4 is equals to how much they have given which is 38 so now what about a a will be 5 C + 2 / 3 yes just what we can do is I think this this a value is easy we can substitute this a value so when I substitute this a value instead of a which is 2D + 6 so what about B so B will be 8 D + 18 / 5 so what about C 6D + 16 ID 5 right and what about D we can take d as it is 8 4 are 32 12 12 + 3 8 4 are 32 remaining will be 3 12 15 152 right so friends understood or not what I did is right so here we you can able to see all the values what I have written is in the terms of D so when you equate it we can easily easily find what is the D value here just let's equate it because we can take LCM as 5 so 5 into 2 will be 10 D 6 5 are 30 + 8 D + 18 + 6 D + 16 + 5D is equals to 1 5 2 are 10 remaining will be 1 5 5 are 25 1 26 so remaining will be 2 so 5 67 which is 760 so now here we have 6 D 8 D 10 D 5D right so 10 and 8 which is 18d 18 D + D 18 D + 6 D will be 24 D so 24 D + 5 this will be 29 D so total will be 29 right so as 30 18 is 48 so 48 + 16 so 48 right is 48 58 62 When You Subtract this 696 so is equals to 696 so when you subtract 696 here D is equals to 24 so friend finally we got the value of D is equals to 24 just now I have told you right this is the most important clue in the question by using this clue definitely you can able to find one person H so similarly we have found the one person age that is D is equals to 24 so if you find one person age finding all the remaining person is easy because if you substitute D any of the equation what we found we can find what is C so if you substitute D is equals to here then we will get what is the value of B that's it solving a question is really easy so friends while solving this kind of question keep most important point that when you should equate and when you should find the average if you are going to find the average then by using the average clue you are going to find one person exact age so you have to be careful after finding a BC substitute in the average to find 1 person age right so now according to the question the percentage of B is what percentage more or less than the present P of C so B and C we have to find right so first let me Target the B's H so if we need to find the B's age right so substitute D is equals to 24 here to find what is the B's age so B is equals to 8 into 24 + 18 / 5 so this resultant will be the age of of the person d right so this 8 4 are 32 remaining will be 3 16 19 + 8 / 5 so this will be like 19 20 210 right so 210 divided by 5 so once you cancel it 5 4 are 20 so remaining will be 1 5 2 are 10 which is 42 that means the person B age is 42 so B's age will be 42 year so now next we have to find what is the age of the person C after 4 years right so first we have to find what is C's age and then after four years so c age substitute anywh and so you can substitute D here so 24 into 2 so 24 into 2 is 48 so 48 + 6 we will get a sorry what's we have to get CH okay yes we can substitute here so instead of D you can substitute 24 here so 6 into 24 + 16 / 5 so 6 4 are 24 so remaining will be 2 12 14 144 + 16 so this will be 160 right so 4 5 6 160 divided by 5 so if you divide by 5 5 3 are 15 32 so 32 will be the age of the person C so 32 what we got is the age of the person C but while substituting in the formula what they have said is C after 4 years that means you have to add additional four which is 36 so according to the question C 36 what about B 42 so now we have to find x - y / Y into 100 formula substitute x 42 - 36 ID 36 into 100 which will be 16.66% so this will be the answer for the question at any point do not expect shortcut because I have seen students while solving it they ask me Teach Me shortcut teach me not at all right if you're going for the mains exam or if you're going for the cat exam you can't expect the shortcuts you can solve all these qu methods fastly you should not solve the way what I'm doing here right it might take more than 10 or 15 minutes to solve a single question but be fast while solving if if you if I want to if I'm going to solve the same question without teaching I can surely solve it with in s or 8 minutes I can just like that equated it directly here so that fast comes one while you practice more number of question but do not expect shortcut at any scenario if you are preparing for the mains exam try to understand each and every question what is the logic here to solve the question so first question we equate it because the major part is the equation and here is the second question and the second question the major part is the average right the same concept can also be asked in the data inter interpretation whatever be the concepts are more important right so finally friends answer for this question is 16. 66 percentage I'm really sorry for the throat but I think you can I think my voice is little bit audiable right so answer for the question number two is 16.66% so here is the third question so the ratio between the present age of p q and R is 5 is to 6 is to 7 so and the average age of P and S together is 39 years average of Q and T is 34 years and the percentage of U is average percentage of p and Q together if the ratio between the percentage of p and U is 3 is4 find the average age of Stu together so when see here what is a target here everything they're talking about average ratio and here also none of the value was directly given every value has been given in terms of ratio but two data has been given directly one is the average age of P and S and then second point average age of Q and T so those two values are directly given that is average age has been given so our Target is to find what is the average of EST and U the value what they have given is pqr but what we need to find the average of St and U together okay so be very careful right first step by step we can solve the question so first step so initially they have given the percentage of 3 person that is p q and R right so p q and R which is in the ratio 5 is to 6 is 7 so we can say that the average age of P average age of Q will be 5x Q will be 6X R will be 7x so these values are will be the present age of all the three person that is p q and r so now according to the second point average age of P and S together is 39 years so average age that means P and S together 2 person is equals to 39 years so we already know that P percentage is 5X so substitute here so 5x + S is equal to 39 into 2 will be 78 so now what we can do was s is equal to 78 minus of 5x so we found one person present age that is s is equal to 78 - 5x so second data what they have given average age of Q and T So q and T that means two persons so q and T average age which what they have given is 34 years so 34 so we already know that the present age of the second person Q is 6X so 6X + T is equal to 68 so we can say t is equal to 68 minus of 6X so finally what we found is s as well as we have found this T so next point so the present age of U is the average percent age of s and t together so the present age of U right what they are saying is the present age of U is equals to the average age of s and t and we already found both the person s and t value right so we can directly substitute in instead of s 78 - 5 and instead of T 68 - 6 y so that will be the value of the percentage of U so percentage of U will be the average of these two person so 78 minus of 5x so similarly T will be 68 minus of 6X / 2 so this can be written as 8 and 8 will be 16 remaining will be 1 so this will be 14 148 minus of 11x ided by 2 which will be the value of y so finally we got the value of y will be 146 - 11 x by 2 and we got SN T so now what is the next point they have given us if the ratio between the percentage of p and U is 3 is4 so p and U the ratio what they have given is 3 is4 so now I think we know all the value right because we know the percentage of the person p is how much 5x so instead of P we can substitute 5x and instead of U we already got 144 146 - 11x / 12 is = 3 is 4 I think we can equate this in order to find what is the value of x so we can once you divide this 5x so completely divided by 146 - of 11x by 2 is equal to 3x 4 so friends understood or not so we can bring the two to the numerator so which becomes 10 x so the numerator will be 10 x here so now cross multiply it so this becomes 40x is equals to so multiply by 3 so minus of 33x so multiply by 3 6 into 3 will be 18 remainder will be 1 12 1 13 remainder will be 1 so 438 so 40x so when you bring this 33 towards left hand side this will be 73x so 7 3x = to 438 so finally what is our Target our Target is to find the average so all the three person average we need to find so that is not a problem so first let me find what is the value of x and then substitute here so this becomes like 42 43 6 times right so X is equal to 6 so finally we got the value X is equals to 6 so once you found one value finding all the remaining value will be easy just know I have told you right and most of the question we have done it so like uh first we found average we found one value and in previous question we equated and we found the value of X and Y so once you find any one value finding the remaining values will be very very easy so now X is equals to 6 year now according to the question our Target is to find what is the average age of S T and U so what about s so we got x equal to 6 here so 6 5 are 30 that means 78 - 30 which will be 48 so 48 will be the value of s and what about t so 6 into 6 will be 36 so 68 - 36 remaining will be 32 right yes 32 so 32 will be the age of the person T and what about U so substitute 6 this will be 146 minus of 66 / by 2 so this will be like another 66 and we have to add all the three right so we have to add all the three and we have to divide by 2 see 32 48 that will be 80 80 160 4 3 are 12 120 so I think in order to find the average so this will be 120 like that will be 80 40 120 120 divided by 3 will be 40 so finally we can say that the average age of all the three person St will be 40 so which is the answer for this question right so friends so listen here uh we have solved in this video three important question so now go to the aptitude and reasoning test on the test package so totally just remember one thing because you have to know this the students after buying the test they think where is the remaining question so just listen carefully in this video I thought three question so now I have given two question as a test so this is the thing what we seen in the video now and two question as a test so totally once you open the test you can able to see total number of questions will be five so five question so inside the five question the question what I thought now is also there in the test so totally the first video what I posted on problems on ages that is three question I have thought and two question I've have given as test so similarly on the next video another three question I will be teaching and another two new question I will be giving as a test so totally you will get every test five five question so after posting each and every video I will give you a test like this so now after watching this video now you how the level of the question is right so take your time just take half an hour or one hour of time for the preparation start writing the test the same question write the test again so only then you can understand where you are making a mistake and two new question I have given in case I have given the solution also in case if you have any doubt on it kindly let me know I can teach that question also on a separate video right so so practice is more and more important and remember one thing those are preparing for Mains level for any competitive exams remember one thing do not expect shortcut and secondly speed is not at all important even if you take five or 10 minutes to solve one question that is not at all a problem but the problem is after taking 10 minutes if you are not getting an answer then it's like lack of practice if you spend 10 minutes on any one question if you're getting a correct answer that is extremely good because solving one question or two question on quantitative aptitude miscellaneous is not at all easy like cat and Bank SBA po level exams so if you need to solve it now itself practice slowly slowly practice surely you can able to clear the mains exam right so friends thank you so much for watching this video video again do not forget to purchase the test and start writing it and there are data interpretation main level questions are also there so after buying aptitude and reasoning go to the mains level area and start practicing it so friends thank you so much for watching this video see you on the next video on the reminding three question on the problems on ages so thank you so much for watching bye,unknown
okh4hGoaFOY,a certain sum of money becomes three times the value in 20 years at simple interest in how many years does double itself in the same rate of simple interest so just here a similar sort of question what we Sol in the previous two so sum of money becomes three times so the money what they have invested is not given let's assume pre is the amount what they have invested so this amount becomes three times the principal in 20 years so now our Target is to find an how many years it doubles it itself so P has to become two times the principal in how many years but here they talking about the same rate of simple interest so now by using the First Data what they have given we can find the rate of interest here so overall amount formula is equals to principal plus interest overall amount will be three times the principal so principal invested we have assumed as P so interest will be PNR by 100 so now 3p minus P will be 2 p is equals to p number of years is 20 rate of interest r divided by 100 so we can cancel p and p year 1 2 are 2 10 * 1 10 are 10 10 times so rate of interest is equals to 10 percentage so by using the same rate of interest our Target is to find in how many years it doubles itself so s similarly use the same formula a equal to p+ interest overall amount will be 2p amount invested as principle so p n r / 100 so 2 p minus P will be p is equal to P into n into rate of interest which is 10 divided by 100 so we can cancel principal and principal year 10 so number of years is equals to 10 year so in 10 years the same amount becomes double this will be the answer for this question,unknown
qwgPWbgyRs4,a sum of money becomes nine times as much in 20 years in simple interest so a money becomes how many how many times nine times the amount what they have invested is not given so let's assume p is the amount what they have invested so this amount becomes nine times the principal in how many years in 20 years right in a simple interest so our Target is to find what is the 10 times of rate of interest see the amount what they have invested is not given but this amount becomes nine times in 20 years we know the basic formula overall amount is equals to principal plus interest so overall amount it becomes 9 times the principal so principal what they have invested is p what about interest PNR ided by 100 so 9 P minus P will be 8 p is equals to principal number of years is directly given in the question which is 20 into R ided by 100 so we can cancel this p and p here so similarly one time we can cancel this five times so 8 into 5 will be 40 so rate of interest is 40 percentage but this is not the final answer why because our Target is to find what is 10 times the rate of interest so here one times the rate of interest is 40 10 times the rate of interest will be 400 percentage answer for this question is 400 percentage,unknown
XY4k0Qaa_e8,if money double itself in 8 years in simple interest in how many years will it be five times so our Target is to find in how many years the money becomes five times but they have given one data here if money double itself in 8 years but the amount what they have invested is not given so let's assume the amount the principal what they have invested is p so this P amount becomes two times the principal amount in 8 years so now the same principle it becomes five times but in how many years that is our Target to find so just listen carefully we know that the overall amount a is equals to principal plus interest so the overall amount a which is two * the principal so principal what they have invested is p what about i n r ided by 100 so 2 p minus P will be P so principle number of years in 8 years it becomes two times the principal so number of years is equals to eight so rate of interest divided by 100 so we can cancel principal and principal so one time which is 12.5 so rate of interest is equals to 12.5% from the First Data what they have given we found the rate of interest is 12.5 so now according to the question our Target is to find the same principle if it has to become five times in how many years apply the same logic overall amount is equals to principal plus interest so overall amount it has to become 5 * the principal so principal P so plus P NR / 100 so 5 P minus P will be 4 p is equals to principal number of years that is our Target to find rate of interest is 12.5 ided by 100 so we can cancel p and p one time eight times year so n is equals to 32 year so answer for this question is 32 years,unknown
lLTR7V80chM,"first of all thanks for being here in my YouTube channel so friends here in this video we are going to see three important pie chart that is for this year SBA clerk prelims exam so uh remember one thing when you take SBA Clerk and when you look at the previous year question papers so in some batches in 2019 I'm saying in 2019 Before covid Time in some batches in the prelims exam they have asked three data interpretation right so 3da out of 3 da two was a table chart one Pi one table chart and another was a casel question so practice more and more number of Da and always go with mind calculation because you should solve a data interpretation in the prelims exam maximum 3 minutes not more than that when you keep on practicing a daily test I that's the reason I'm giving you daily test practice the daily test and try to solve each and every question within 30 seconds or 45 seconds maximum time I am saying right so if you're preparing for an SBA cler so keep that in mind the most important thing is 80% chance of asking 2 Da in the exam that is I'm the prelims exam I'm saying because when we take all the previous year question papers you can able to see two data interpretation were asked in the prelims exam on SBA Clerk and mostly reason time for the last four four years from 21 21 22 23 in most of of the bank prelims exam we can able to see a question that was a caselet question casel DA they will give you a passage we have to read the passage we have to frame a table chart and then we have to solve a question so uh what I would recommend is not to touch the casel question initially right so try to solve first da and then solve the simplification or approximation equation number series go with miscellaneous question at last if you have 3 minutes or 5 minutes time at that scenario solve the caselet question why because casel question might definitely take you more than four or five minutes because you have to read the question you have to frame a table and then after after framing a table you have to find out all the values in the table if you make any one small mistake a number then the complete table might be wrong so better do not touch the casel question initially at last if you have time solve the casel question and mostly in the uh prelims exam you can able to see one or two da and pie chart will be mostly will be there py chart da because most of the batches in the previous year SBA clerk they have got only pie chart table chart was asked in only few batches and casel question was there always right so keep on practicing that and one important thing if you're going for a prelims exam so lion chart be careful on the lion chart alone if the question if the da that it is based on a line chart there are more and more chance of making a mistake because while finding a value in the line chart is not at all easy for example if it is 30 and if it is this value is 40 so they mention here like this right so they will Mark like this and somewhere they point and draw a line chart here if they have given a line chart be careful with all these lines whether it is 1 or whether it is 2 32 34 36 3840 that means every line is two so first find that and if it is a single value single value line chart do one convert the line chart into a small table and then solve a question because you won't make a mistake every time while reading a question if you check the line chart there are more and more chance of making a mistake while figuring out the values so better if they have asked a casel question solve at the last if the question that is based on a line chart first convert the line chart into a small table chart and then solve the question that will be easy and mostly practice more number of pie chart with what percentage more or less what percentage or only what how much more or less how much exceeds average these type of question and mostly go with mind calculation if you go with mind calculation surely you can able to solve the questions right so here in this video I will be just teaching you only three da important da for SBA cler and next video I will be posting uh videos based on important case Le question everything so again I'm saying write the daily test only daily test will help you the practice so write the daily test surely you can able to get that practice and you can solve the da within 2 and2 minute so now let me move on to the three important da in this video so friends now let me move on to all the data interpretation in this video right for SBA clerk exam so total number of students has been given which is 5,500 so the chart values all the values are in terms of percentages so now let me move on to the first question so find the number of average number of students appeared in shift a b d on the exam so we need to find the average just add all the values and divide by three and go with mostly go with M calculation just see what is a a is 20 percentage so B is how much 16 percentage D is how much 12 percentage so 20 + 36 + 46 + 48 so totally all the three will be 48% average so divide by 3 48 divided by 3 which is 16 percentage 16% of 5,500 so how to find 16% M calculation so 16% can be written as 10 + 6 10% of 5,500 will be 550 yes so remaining will be 6 percentage so 5,500 1 percentage will be 65 so 55 so what about 6 percentage 55 into 2 6 so 30 30 33 which is 330 so finally we can say that answer for this question is 880 so that's the reason I'm saying go with lot and lot of Mind calculation while practicing itself even if you're making a mistake it's okay but try to keep on practice it right so how I calculated is 16 percentage of 5,500 right so what I did here is 16% I have converted as 10% plus 6 per so 10% of ,500 will be 550 what about 6 percentage 1 percentage will be 55 so 6 per into 6 will be 330 so when you add both answer will be 880 see easy right so while practicing itself lot no I usually say this to lots of students that go with always mind calculation initially 20 or 30 times you will make a mistake but after that you will keep on you can able to see your improvements in the mind calculation will be done right so second question find the central angle for the students appearing in the shift B of the examination so we have to find the central angle here central angle means the percentage value should be converted into degree so I have already told you if it is a percentage it should when you add all the values in the chart it will be 100 percentage if it is a degree when you add all the values in the pie chart it should be 360° so 100 percentage is equals to 360 according to this question our Target is to convert the B value into a central angle so B is how much 16% so 16 percentage is equals to X 100% is equals to 360 we can cancel percentage percentage 1 0 1 0 we can cancel it on two Table 5 2 are 10 8 2 are 16 so finally this can be written as 36 into 8 / 5 so 36 ID 5 will be 7.5 7.5 into 8 will be 57.6 see entire question go with mind calculation right so if you feel difficult I will solve it but again while watching the video you two go with mind calculations right so we already know that 100 percentage is how much 360° so now according to the question shift B shift B is how much 16 percentage so 16 per is equals to X so cancel 0 0 cancel it on two Table 5 2 are 10 8 2 are 16 so X is equal to 36 into 8 / 5 so when we cancel it 7.2 so 16 1 56 57 so 57.6 de which is the answer for this question see I'm sorry see go with mine calculation right so next question third question so find the total number of students appear in E and F together in the examination so we have to find the total students from E and F so e is how much 10 10 percentage f is how much 18% so E and F which is 28% so we have to find what is 28% of 5,500 so 28 can be split into 20 + 8 what about 10 percentage 550 what about 20 percentage 1,00 so 1,00 will be 20% so now REM remaining we have how much 8 percentage 1 percentage is 55 8 percentage 55 into 8 so which is 8 5 are 440 so 440 when you add 154 so answer for this question is 154 right so what I did is 28% of 5,500 so 28 I have written as 20 + 8 percentage so 10 per is 550 20% 550 + 550 will be 1,00 what about the remaining 8 1 percentage is 55 55 into 8 will be 440 so answer will be 1540 which is the answer for this question right so next question question students appeared in the shift C and D together in the examination is what percentage more or less so while reading a question we found one of the important word here what percentage more or less so if you find this word what percentage more or less then definitely we know that it's a formula x - y / Y into 100 so here our comparison it should be shift a so we need to compare with shift a that means me the denominator value should be shift a you don't want to find all the shift C person shift d person separately why because numerator also we are going to write 5,500 denominator also 5,500 we are going to cancel it so better instead of finding all the values separately WR only the percentage so c and d c is how much 24 D is how much 12 when you add these two value resultant will be 36 what about a a is 20 so 36 - 20 ID 20 into 100 so 36 - 20 will be 16 so 16 by 20 into 100 so we can cancel this 5 * 30 80 per so answer for this question is 80% at any point do not calculate like this 36% of 5,500 20 percentage of 5,000 don't do it why because we are going to write the step here and we are going to write this step here denominator also 20% of 5,500 we take 5,500 common and we will cancel the value so instead of writing all the things and cancel it again waste of time so better don't write it write only the percentage value right so which is the answer for the fourth question so find the ratio of students appearing in shift d and f together appearing in shift B and C together see we need to find the ratio so similarly if we need to find the ratio left hand side we will get 5,500 right hand side also 5,500 so don't write the value better write only the percentage value right so d and f d is how much 12 f is how much 18 so 12 + 18 will be 30% right so next will be B and C B is how much 16° 16 percentage C is how much 24 so 16 + 24 will be 40 so we can cancel 0 0 3 is 4 so answer for this question is 3 is 4 see how easy it is right so very easy all the five questions surely you can able to crack within 2 and a half minute it is possible when you keep now when you start practicing like this right directly in the exam you can't able to do this so practice now itself go with lot of Mind calculation so that surely you can able to solve all the da question within limited number of time so these are the five question first set of Da so now let me move on to the next da so next da here they have given a table chart so where the total number of students for 2023 given 2024 total number of students given girls and given boys was not given so when you subtract total minus girls resultant will be boys right so let me move on to the first question if the average number of students in school P 20 23 24 25 is 700 find the total number of students in school p in 2025 see the average has been given for three different years the total student average is 700 so 23 24 25 divided by 3 is equals to 700 so 23 24 25 is equals to 700 into 3 the total will be 2,00 minus of 23 and 24 so 720 minus of 900 so 9 900 right so friends understood or not so this will be 2, so this will be 1,620 so here we have 380 and here we have 100 so answer will be 480 so answer for this question is 480 easy right don't write everything in the paper so what I did is 3 years right so 23 24 25 so they have given average is equals to 7,000 700 what they have given so 23 24 25 is equals to 2,00 and we know 23 total number of students is 720 24 total number of students is 900 so out of total 2,00 minus of 720 plus 900 When You Subtract these two value you will get the average right so now that will be the total number of students from school P very easy so second question number of girls in school p and Q together is what percentage more or less just see what percentage more or less that means we have to use the formula x - y / Y into 100 right so whenever you see this x percentage what percentage or X percentage or what percentage more or less definitely it's a formula right so here we have to compare with q and R together in 2024 that means the denominator value y should be q and R and the numerator value X should be p and Q so now let me find what is the total number of girls in school p and q p and Q so p and Q in 2024 so 2024 is 450 180 450 + 180 will be 630 so 630 will be the value of x what about the value of y q and R together so Q is how much where they talking about the total 600 400 600 400 will be 1,000 so 630 minus of 1,000 divided 1,000 into 100 so we can cancel 1 0 1 0 two Z here so 1,000 - 630 will be 370 so 370 divided by 10 which is 37% so answer for this question is 37% right so always remember one think more or less whenever you see this word more or less definitely it's a formula right don't not forget this x - y / Y into 100 so next question find the total number of boys in school pqr together in 2023 so here for 2023 we have to find what is the total number of boys in all the three schools see we know the girls right so if 720 is total 360 is girls then remaining 360 will be boys so similarly calculate for other thing so 360 180 so remaining 180 so 450 270 remaining will be 180 so when you add all the resultant value will be 720 so 720 will be the total number of boys in all the three different schools so next question so next question average number of students in school pqr in 2023 are what G just see the word what percentage if it is what percentage more or less we use a formula x - y / Y into 100 if it is only what percentage the formula will be X by Y into 100 so X will be the value pqr in 2023 so 2023 pqr average number of students so either we can add all the three numbers and divide by three or else separately you can divide all the numbers by three and you can add it both are same so when you when you divide 720 by 3 which is 240 next 360 divided by 3 120 so next will be 450 150 divid by so when you add a resultant will be 510 so 510 will be the average of total number of students in 2023 so now total number of students in school Q in 2024 so here 600 is the total number of students we know 510 is numerator value 600 will be denominator value into 100 so we can cancel it 85% so answer for this question is 85% right so very easy right so most mostly you can go with mind calculations so that's the reason I'm saying always practice like this which will be easy so next question find the ratio of number of number of boys in school Q so School Q in 2024 2024 School Q so we can able to see 600 is the total 180 is the girls and remaining 420 will be the boys so the number of boys in R so 400 is the total so 120 is the total number of of girls remaining 280 will be boys so we can cancel 0 0 6 is 4 3 is2 so answer for this question is 3 is to2 so five question was easy when you go with just like that when you go with mind calculation surely you can able to solve this question within 2 and half minute so here is the next data interpretation that is based on a pie chart so where the pie chart all the values are given in terms of percentages and the total income is how much 15,000 they have given so first question income of a in the month of Jan and April together is what percentage less again you can able to see the word what percentage less that means if it is more or less the answer can be positive or negative if even the question itself they have given what percentage less that means the final answer will be in terms of negative right so now April and Jan together so Jan is how much 8% April is how much 20% so 20 + 8 will be 28 per so remaining is how much March and June together so March is how much 16 percentage June is how much 24% so this will be 20 30 40% so 40% minus of 28% divided by 40% into 100 because we we are going to get the answer in negative just see actually this should be written as 28% minus 40 ided by 40 into 100 this is the way we have to write this question in the formula so only then we will get 28 - 40 the resultant answer will be minus of 12 that means less so minus of 12 / 40 into 100 cancel 0 this will be 3 30 per so answer for this question is 30 percentage so just a moment so friends be very careful that this value always remember one thing if you're getting in terms of negative it is less if you are getting in terms of positive it is more because in most of the questions option you can able to see 30% less 30% more so you have to mark the right option so whenever you get an answer in negative it is less so this is the answer for the first question so second question income of a in May and June together is how much more than it's not about percentage if it is how much more percentage then we can go with the formula x - y by 100 but here you have to find just how much more that means we have to find the value difference right so May and June together so may is how much may is 20 June is how much 24 so 20 + 24 which is 44 percentage and F month March so f is how much 12 March is how much 16 so this will be 28 percentage so now you can able to see we have to see how much more how that that means we have to see the difference so what is the difference here so 44 28 percentage so here we have 12 + 4 will be 16 percentage is the difference so 16 percentage of 15,000 so we can cancel two Z directly so 150 into 16 will be 24 0 so answer for this question is 24 so we have to just read the question carefully and check what we need to find here whether we need to find the percentage or whether we need to find only the value So based upon that Target and find the answer right so next question which month shows the highest percentage increment in the income as compared to the previous month so we have to find in which month the highest percentage increment see that means from the previous year for example if you take Jan month and F month we have to compare F to Jan only then we can able to see in the from the previous month what is the increment for me you have to you should not check in the positive way that means in the clockwise Direction you have to check in the anticlockwise direction so if you need to check for March and April month you have to check with April to March so only then you can see how much the increment was given so now when you look at the chart definitely May and April will not be there why because we have 2020 so no in increment year so when you take June and May 4 percentage Jan and F 4 percentage because 12 - 8 12 - 8 12 minus of 8 ID by 8 that means 4 ID 8 into 100 so 50% increment so now the next month F and March so F and March 16us 12 so 4 ID by 12 into 1003 33% increment right so next will be 20 - 6 16 so 20 - 16 will be 4 so 4 by 16 4X 4 into 100 so which is 25% increment so we are we we are not getting the here these are the values are lowest increment so the one day highest increment is Jan month to F month which is 50 percentage increment so 50% increment was done in the month of Jan and Feb right so so friends remember one thing if the question is based on a increment based concept you should calculate the value in a anticlockwise direction reverse order right so if it is Jan to F month we have to calculate from F to Jan so F to Jan will be 12 12 percentage is on F month Jan month is 8 percentage divided by 8 because we have to compare it so divide by 8 into 100 so 12 - 8 will be 4 4 by 8 into 100 1X 2 into 100 which is 50% so 50% increment is done on Jan and F so reminding all the months it was just 30 25 percentage so our Target is to find the highest percentage increment so that means Jan to F month is the highest percentage increment so next question income in the month of March and April together makes how much central angle so we have to find the central angle just now I have told you central angle means the degree value 100 per is equals to 360 right 100% equal to 360 so now we have to find for March and April so March is how much 16 percentage April is how much 20 per so 60 + 20 will be 36 so 36 percentage is equals to X we can cancel 0 0 here so X is equal to 36 into 36 divided by 10 so 36 into 36 will be 1296 1296 divided by 10 will be 129. 6° so 129. 6° will be the answer for this question or else you can cancel this on two table you can find out the answer right so always remember that if it is a pie chart question there are two model one is based on percentage and second based on degree right so A's average income in starting 4 month in the given six month is how much less see it is not how much percentage less they are just asking how much less that means we have to find the value in the difference right that means we should not get the answer in terms of percentages we just need to find the exact value so out of 6 months first 4 months average income so Jan March and April first four month so 20 this will be another 2040 so this will be 40 + 16 so 20 20 40 56 so 56 percentage divided by 4 so 14 per so 14 percentage is the average for the first four months last 4 months so 20 40 uh 60 80 percentage divide by 4 20% So 20% is the average income for the last 4 months and 14 will be the average income for the first four months now we need to find the difference so 1420 difference is 6 percentage so 6 percentage of 15,000 so cancel 0 0 150 into 6 will be 900 so answer for this question question is 900 right so don't find the anwers separately I have seen students finding a separately first four months separately and finding what is the answer and last four months separately finding what is the answer and then they will subtract both don't do that right in most of the DI question uh that is based on what percentage more or less or else what percentage uh just finding what percentage or uh find how much difference how much more how much exceeds for a ratio value all these type of question at any point do not find the value separately try to find out the value directly because at any point we will cancel the value so you don't want to write and you don't want to find it directly try to figure out and find the answer so friends that's it so it's a small video I'm I'm extremely sorry that I could not able to post videos because of my uh health condition was not good but anyway I just want to post this video because this is the level of the question that you will find in the competitive exam recent times so only if you go with mind calculation more you can able to solve these kind of question faster or else you might take more than 8 or 10 minutes to solve a single question so don't do that write the daily test every test we have given a data interpretation write the test again and again only then the speed will come so friends thank you so much for watching this video and in the

sUQLbHuFGk0,first of all thanks for being here in my YouTube channel so friends here is the eighth lesson on the topic blood relation so now we are going to solve the question that is based on pointing to a photograph where the question does not contains the word my right myy my so already we have seen seven different lesson I think I've posted five or six years back still now many students are watching it I'm always happy that even today I can able to see the older videos getting views because of the concepts what I thought clearly I'm very happy about it so now getting into the topic blood relation and before solving all the questions here so first we have already seen seven different lesson if you are a beginner right kindly go and learn all the seven lesson first and then come and watch this video because it's not the first lesson it's the eighth lesson on the topic blood relation right so out of the seven lesson when you take a blood relation topic there are three categories of question that you can able to see in the exam one is question that is based on a family tree so second it is based on a equation concept like uh p + Q minus or division of R is equals to question mark based upon an equation we have to draw a tree diagram and the last is the pointing to a photograph so there are three model questions you can able to see on the topic blood relation here and if you you if you are like going for any competitive exam it can be a railway or it can be SSC or it can be uh your state level competitive exams like uh EB electricity board or whatever be 80% chances of asking a question on the topic blood relation that is only from the area pointing to a photograph so reminding 20% you can able to see question from this area right so pointing to a photograph usually you can able to see one question that is for one mark in your exam in case if the question paper was little bit difficult or if you if you are like preparing for a bank exams and other sort of exam so this family tree based question you can able to see for 3 to five marks and similarly e question will be asked for one to two marks right but moreover 80% chance of asking a question on the topic blood relation is only from the area pointing to a photograph so now getting into the seven lesson so this is the last sth lesson on the blood relation topic I have solved a question that is based on a pointing to a photograph but the question contains the word my because if the question contains the word my I have told you a shortcut a small technique right how to draw a tree diagram if a pointing to a photograph question that contains my so after my you have to draw a tree diagram and and at the last after reading the complete sentence before my you have to draw the remaining sort of the family tree diagram and then you have to compare it that is the shortcut and that is the easy way to solve the question which contains the word my and uh here is the fifth lesson equation will be the sixth lesson that I have explained about the equation and then fourth lesson and fifth lesson so we have seen a question that is based on a family tree so two different sort of question like if the if the family contains only limited number of people or two to three generation of family is there so I've explained on the fourth lesson and the fifth lesson and then so second lesson and third lesson I have explained you how to draw a family tree that is the most important stuff and the first lesson is the overview right so these are the seven different lesson what I have posted earlier on the topic blood relation so now getting into the eighth lesson now so what we are going to see here is many students will keep on uh asking me like how to solve a question the same concept question pointing to a photograph if the question does not have this word my right if it is if it if it have a word my then we have learned a shortcut we have solved many question as well if you can't able to find it you can go with the live class if you search in a live class there is a concept called pointing to photograph I have solved 20 question on the live class too you can watch that video also which is based on this pointing to a photograph right and now what we are going to see in this eighth lesson is if a question does not contains a word my what is the shortcut so see if the question does not contains a word my search for other words like she e IM or her so just check whether these words are given in the question because every time for example initially they will be saying like Satish is Satish is compared with the Divya right so there are two person for example I'm saying so pointing to a photograph Satish is saying something right if the question starts like this and initially they will tell you Satish is pointing to a person in a photograph but after that they won't say Satish they will say like is uncle is brother that means the word is represents Satish right sometimes they will talk about the girl name Divya right so pointing to a photograph Divya said so in the first sentence you can able to see the word Divya after that they will not give you the word Diva they will say she's she's sister she's mother so she's daughter so that means the word she represents the person Divya right so you have to be very careful if the word may was not given search for any of it whether she is there e im or her in case if this word is also not given in the question then the question will be in the form of sons you can able to see like Sons daughters father's brother you can able to see the continuous word right so Sons daughter's father's brother that means you have to go in a step by- step process son daughter for the son some person's son for this son daughter for this daughter father for the father father brother you have to draw in a step by step way to to get the family tree perfectly right so these are the different way that you can able to see a question which does not contains a word my and so these are the two ways I will be solving some of the questions here what I have already uh I think these are the questions were taken from the uh previous year question papers of various competitive exams I will be solving All Those Questions here where the question does not contains my so how to solve it and it requires more and more practice so friends keep that in mind just by solving 10 or 20 question you can't able to solve this question in your exams it requires more and more practice and every time before solving a blood relation question first you have to look at the options how the options are whether the options are like sister or cousin so if the option A is like the sister or cousin second andt or pet Al an example if they have given a option like this that means we have many possibilities either it can be sister or it can be cin so while drawing a tree diagram also you have to draw all the possibilities in case in the option if you have only one thing like option a sister option b Aunt then you don't want to go with any possible diagram because exact answer they have given an option so don't go with any possibilities right so that comes only when you practice more number of question and most of the students will not learn this pointing to a photograph the main reason is they think it is difficult and more chance of making a mistake kindly don't do it learn it because it's a easy topic and in many competitive exams are students are losing this one mark because of this right without writing this pointing to learning they are losing the mark and students those who learned this concept are getting one Mark and they are ahead of other students the main reason is this pointing to a photograph right so learn it important topic and if you are a beginner do not forget to watch all the seven lesson first and then come and watch this video so now let me move on to the question that is based on pointing to a photograph without M here is the first question a girl introduced a boy as the son of the daughter of the father of her uncle how is the boy related to the girl so the question is like pointing to a person because a girl is pointing a boy and and she is explaining the complete sentence right so first check whether in the question whether we have a word my if the my was not given in the question then check just now I have told you what are the other chances so check whether because here the girl is talking the complete sentence because the girl is introducing a boy the complete sentence was said by that girl right check whether we have any word she or her in the question just see the girl introduced a boy as the son of the daughter of father of her uncle just look at the word carefully her uncle that means this her represents the girl yes or no because the girl is saying this complete sentence so if she is saying the complete sentence the word her represents that girl so start drawing a tree diagram from this point everything is same as what we learned for the M right so her uncle that means the girl Uncle so now just look at the option we don't want to draw any possible diagram why because all the options are exactly given so don't go with any possible family tree right so now we have to start drawing from here not from there if you start drawing a diagram from there there is a chance of making a mistake so we found the word small clue that they have given a uncle that means the girl Uncle so girl should have a mother or a father any one person and that person brother should be the girl uncle right so usually we call Uncle as our mother brother or father brother so girl Uncle so girl should have a father or mother and that person brother should be the uncle so girl uncle and then the previous word is a father of for this Uncle father right same way what we saw like my so before father we have daughter of for this father daughter right just just look at carefully for this father if it is a daughter One Chance is the girl mother no other way we can't able to draw another possible year why because just now I have told you we in the options we are not seeing any possible cases all the options are directly given so father daughter should be definitely the girl's mother and son of so this person son then it should be the girl brother right so answer for this question because our Target is to find how is B related to the girl so from the girl the relation of the boy is the brother so answer for the first question is brother so remember one thing by seeing question do not decide that it is difficult because many students after solving five or six question they won't touch this topic they say it's very difficult chance of making a mistake no and not at all right it's a easy topic don't miss that one mark in your competitive exam practice at least the 50 question I have given the test also uh in my uh Channel aptitude and reasoning I've given the test also write the test that's the reason I've given practice question more so write the test understand the concept here very simple draw slowly and many students will have this doubt why you are fixing here can I fix it can be an another sister here also right because you can see father daughter father daughter is not one chance I can draw here also a yes you can draw when you should draw is look at the options here if the uh if the question is like brother or a cousin if the options are like niece or cousin if they have given an option like this then you can go with the possible diagram either the answer can be brother or it can be cousin but here the options are the exact way exact thing has been given no possibility options has been given so you don't want to draw a possible diagram you can fix it and you can solve the question right so answer for the first question is brother question number two so Ram introduced a Raju as the son of the only brother of his father's wife how Ram related to Raju right so here you can able to see there are two person one is RAM and second is Raju so the complete sentence was talking by the person Ram because Ram is introducing Raju here so after reading the question check whether we have a word my if the my was not given in the question here the person Ram is talking so a male person so definitely in the sentence there will be a a word e or IM right so or is right so e IM is so these are the words that you can able to see in the question so just check as the son of the one brother of his father's wife so is father's wife that means the complete sentence was talking by the person Ram so this word is represents the person Ram ear right so this is the clue so by using this we can start drawing the tree diagram so so Ram father's wife that father's wife means Ram father wife right so first Ram so Ram is having a father and this person father wife that means it's a Ram's mother right so Ram father's wife so now from this point read the sentence before the word is one brother for his wife right so for his wife one brother that means for the ram it will be uncle right so brother wife brother right so mother's brother mother's Brothers will be uncle right so before one brother son of so brother's one son that will be the person Raju so now our Target is to compare what is the relation between RAM and Raju so RAM and Raju is not the brothers and sister why because when you compare this relation between Ram and Raju from Ram it's the mother brother son so mother's brother will be uncle so Uncle son Uncle son should be call it as a cin so answer for this question is cin so when understood so this is the way you have to solve the question that is based on a pointing to a photograph without M sometimes even in some of the question we will not able to see the word is also without that also they can ask you a question question I can solve one question if the pointing to a photograph which does not contains a word my as well as her is him so these words how to solve it so here is the third question so is Brothers wives Brothers mother's husband only daughter's husband is related to as so after reading this question you can able to see there in the question there is no word my as well as there is is or in e nothing was there in the question I have initially in the video itself I have told you if the question does not contains any my or is she Etc then definitely the question will be in the format of apostrophe like brothers wife fathers Sons Etc so what you need to do is you need to draw a family tree not in a reverse order from the front right from the first you have to start drawing the family tree slowly right you will definitely get an answer first step yes brother right so first draw a is having a brother so A's brother so A's brother right brother's wife so this person wife so draw very slowly right wife wife's brother so this person wife brother for brother's mother right so brother's mother mother's husband so mother's husband this person husband one daughter so again just see we already know that these two persons are brothers and sister right for this brother this person is a mother so for this mother this person is the husband then definitely there will be these two person will be the father and mother of the persons right so now what they are saying is from this person husband's one daughter so husband's one daughter will be this girl again right so one daughter means only one girl in a family so that means same this girl right so one daughter's husband so one daughter's husband already we know that the these two person are a married couple right so daughter's one daughter's husband will be this person so finally our Target is to compare what is the relation from a to this person so answer is brother right so see already we know that a is the first sentence itself they have given a is brother so this person is the a brother so now we had drawn all the tree diagram completely and after that we ended at this point so our Target is to find what is the relation between the person which is the brother right so remember that uh you have to start practicing more number of question just by practicing 10 or 15 question you will not get that idea right you have to practice more than 30 or 50 question only on the concept of pointing to a photograph so friends if you are a beginner first time learning blood relation you will feel difficult initially out of the question if you are solving you will get only five or six correct so remaining 24 will be wrong so by seeing that do not fed up and don't say that this is a difficult topic like that so I have seen many students uh losing their score in the exams like point5 they failed in the exam 0 five Mark right 75 because of 75 they have failed in many prelims exam I have seen students preparing for a bank exam only because of this if they crack these types of some difficult level area questions you can able to clear the exam easily practice practice practice surely you can able to crack all these model questions don't feel that this topic is difficult it's one of the easy topic once you understand the logic how to draw a diagram right so friends thank you so much for watching this video and many students were asking this doubt again and again so that's the reason I I posted this as a separate video so friends thank you so much in case still if you want me to post any videos you can just comment us or you can directly mail us I will try to post whatever doubts that you have in the session so friend thank you so much for watching this video and if you really like it share this video to your friends those who are preparing for the competitive exams so thank you so much bye,unknown
