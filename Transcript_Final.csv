Now, when you eat our food, right, it has a built-in GPS navigation system. Once you eat the food, you can tell exactly in which part of the body. But occasionally due to network issues, the food can be one side, the pain will come from some other side. GPS problems will be there. In Ayurvedic times when there were no MRIs and X-rays, they used to make people eat our Telugu food. Based on the pain, they can tell whether it's an answer or a cancer. That's how effective it is. But the thing is when you eat our super spicy food, right, all the intestines go into a war zone. Every body part is pushing it. You'll hear all kinds of noises from coming from inside because they're unable to handle it. And if Yeah, that's true. And that's why if you ever seen any war documentary then there's a big battle ends they send a white ambulance to give first aid that white ambulance is cur [Applause] but occasionally you will meet some hardcore Telugu people who will not even let that white ambulance to come unless there's a red light blinking on top curd rice with mango pickle. So please go and eat cod ice man."

House was wrong. You have to change the vastu of the house. The entry gate should be from the bathroom ventilator. Then only your son will get married. So now they are blaming the house and my parents have decided to renovate the house. Right now my house is under renovation and the problem is both my parents they've been fairly nice couple for the last so many years but now they're fighting so hard about how the house has to be renovated. I'm scared man that the level of fight I don't know even if this vasu concept works and by the end of it I get married I think their marriage will end because the level of fights they're having about how literally they have divided the house into two parts one side is being decor designed as per my mom's taste other half my my dad taste which is fine if it is half the rooms half the rooms no it is bottom half top half flooring according to my mom ceiling according to my dad flooring is minimalist modern spartic tiles with mogulai ceiling. It seems like a veim mundi. And now I realized this is going to be very tricky. I don't want to get involved in this fight. So I hired an interior designer and I told her, ""Ma'am, your main job is to coordinate between both of them and do the design of the house."" And one day I was traveling. This interior designer called me. Sir, can you please speak to your parents and explain to them that the house will not stand when you remove the pillars? They think that pillars are obstructing your marriage that the girl is hiding behind the pillar only. And I said ma'am that's the reason I hired you. I don't want because if I interfere in this fight I will not be able to inherit the house. And she said, ""Sir, if you don't interfere right now, there'll be no house to inherit."
