VmZtY4L7-Us,Why studying bees can teach us about human loneliness | Sarah Kocher | TEDxNewEngland,"Social interactions are essential for the survival and success of many animals, including humans. But how does the brain adapt to support these interactions? By comparing solitary wild bees and those in complex societies, scientists are uncovering fundamental biological patterns that illuminate how the 'social brain' develops and evolves to create the diversity of social life on our planet. 

Sarah is an assistant professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at the Lewis-Sigler Institute for Integrative Genomics at Princeton University. She studies socially variable bees (solitary, social, and socially flexible) to understand the factors that shape the evolution of social behavior. Her lab integrates methods from many different areas of biology, from evolutionary and population genomics to neurobiology and field ecology.

gYpq1_omxOg,How accents make language more beautiful | Muftiat Adeyi | TEDxUniversityofMississippi,"Imagine a world where everyone sounds the same, a monaural monotony of voices.

V5Mnviy6JTM,The Power of Silence! | Ms. Kavya Rawal | TEDxYouth@JGIS,"What if silence wasn’t a void — but a voice?

In this deeply moving and introspective TEDx talk, RJ Kavya Rawal, a well-known radio jockey, explores the profound impact of silence in a world that never stops talking. As someone whose life revolves around sound and conversation, she shares how her greatest lessons didn’t come from what she said — but from what she didn’t.

Through real on-air experiences and honest reflection, RJ Kavya reveals how silence can heal, connect, and humanize us. She reminds us that in the rush to say more, do more, and post more, we often forget the beauty of simply pausing — of truly listening.
 “Because silence isn’t the absence of sound… it’s the presence of meaning.” Kavya Rawal is an accomplished radio professional, voice artist, and content creator based in Ahmedabad. With a background in Psychology and Mass Communication & Journalism, she combines academic insight with a natural flair for storytelling. Kavya began her career as an evening show host at Fever 95 FM and now hosts the popular morning show on 104 Mirchi Love Ahmedabad, where her distinctive voice and engaging style connect with thousands of listeners every day. She has interviewed celebrated figures across film, music, sports, and digital media, and has anchored numerous high-profile events. As a seasoned voice actor, Kavya has lent her voice to thousands of ads, films, and campaigns. A guest lecturer, competition judge, and prior TEDx speaker, she continues to inspire audiences with her authenticity, resilience, and dynamic presence.

Ieo71j-gU1A,How to Make People Happy? | Timo Harakka | TEDxCaledonian Intl School Youth,"In “How to Make People Happy,” Timo Harakka draws from his career as a Finnish politician and public servant to argue that happiness isn’t just a personal pursuit, but a shared, societal mission. He emphasizes the role of strong institutions—transparent governance, reliable welfare systems, and equitable public services—in removing sources of unhappiness. At the same time, he highlights how individual agency, community bonds, and purpose contribute to well‐being. The talk suggests a balance: it’s not enough to have policies that function; a society also needs culture, connection, and opportunities for meaningful participation for people to truly flourish.

If you like, I can pull together key takeaways or quotes from the talk (if available) to flesh this out further. Timo Harakka is a Finnish Member of Parliament and a prominent figure in national and European policymaking. He served as Finland’s Minister of Transport and Communications from 2019 to 2023, where he played a key role in advancing digital infrastructure, sustainable mobility, and the transition to carbon-neutral transport.

With a background in journalism and a strong voice for innovation, Mr. Harakka has championed digital transformation, 5G development, and ethical AI governance across Europe. He has also been a strong advocate for climate action, pushing for smart, green transport solutions and resilient communication networks.

Combining deep political experience with a passion for future-oriented policy, Mr. Harakka brings insight into how societies can embrace technological change while safeguarding democratic values. He continues to serve actively in Parliament, shaping legislation on digitalization, labor, and the environment.

K3ejA0b54PU,The Science of Burnout — And How Your Brain Rebuilds You! | Agastya Sharma | TEDxYouth@JGIS,"What really happens to your brain when you’re burnt out?
In this insightful TEDx talk, Agastya Bhuvnesh Sharma dives deep into the neuroscience of burnout — explaining how chronic stress rewires our brain, silences motivation, and weakens emotional control.

But there’s hope.
Through fascinating research and relatable insights, Agastya reveals how the same brain that breaks down under pressure is also wired to rebuild itself — through rest, reflection, and resilience.

From the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex to the dopamine system, this talk explores how understanding our mind’s biology can help us move from breakdown to breakthrough. Agastya Sharma, a 16-year-old IBDP student at JG International School, is passionate about science, education, and social impact. With a strong academic focus on Biology, Chemistry, and Physics, he aspires to become a neurosurgeon, inspired by his curiosity about the human brain and its healing potential. Agastya has led community outreach initiatives with organizations such as Hamari Pahchan and India Recycles, championing education and social equity. A seasoned public speaker and MUN awardee, he is fluent in five languages and is currently authoring a research paper on BDNF-mediated neurogenesis. Balancing academics with badminton and guitar, Agastya envisions opening a hospital that provides affordable healthcare for underserved communities.
