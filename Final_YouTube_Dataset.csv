individual sounds like a or a or the Rhythm but a lot to do with the overall sound this is why you have an accent speaking English it's like how a flute sounds different from a violin when they're playing the exact same note different material different shape today I'll give you exercises to get the right shape in your throat to get the American accent have you ever done physical therapy and you can't believe how much these little simple exercises help you get better that happened to me when I blew out my ankle I couldn't believe how simple and minimal the exercises were to heal and eventually my ankle got back to 100% it's the exact same thing with speaking American English we want to make small changes here that will have a big impact overall to the way you sound simple exercises for the throat can change everything if you use your throat speaking English the same way you do speaking your own native language you'll probably never get an American sound when speaking English and that's okay no one has to lose their accent to be welcome here on my channel but I know for a lot of my students the goal is to sound as native as possible so let's do some PT that is physical therapy exercises for your throat to get you a truly American accent I'm Rachel I have a background in opera singing and I've been teaching the American accent to non-native speakers for over 20 years scan this QR code or go to Rachels english.com sfree to get my free course the top three ways to master the American accent it will blow your mind it will give you totally new ideas on how to get the sound you've always wanted before we get into the ex exercises let's look at what's happening in the throat when we speak I got this clip from a YouTuber who was able to do what I've always wanted to do he was able to go into an MRI and get a video of the anatomy when speaking or in his case singing Ty Ross is a voice teacher living in New York City and I'll link to his original video and website in the video description it's really worth watching the full video it's very cool he went into an MRI and sang the same part of a Song in four Styles so the sounds were the same the pitches were the same but the overall sound the style was different depending on what he did with his tongue lips and throat listen to this difference it's singing the same note the same vowel in four different styles do you hear a difference let's listen to it on a loop [Music] of course you hear a difference the sound is different because of the position of the tongue and lips but also the throat the voice box or larynx is here it makes the sound the pitch based on how the vocal folds or vocal cords are stretched when air pushes against them causing them to Flap and vibrate but the position of the larynx can change based on the muscles around it and this is what changes the shape of the throat and changes the sound let's look at the four positions so here we're comparing the four different sounds and styles and we can see the changes in the body that are making the sounds different even though the vowel is the same and the pitch is the same the larynx is this part here but look at the shape that's created so the shape here for Opera that's a different shape than the shape here here this line is very flat and in Opera it sort of got a notch out of it also look at this space here it's narrower here than it is here on the light mix then it is here on the Rock style and here in the forward style so this part of the body is changed is moved by the muscles around it and changing its position and its shape changes the shape of the throat the part where the voice is resonating the empty space here in the mouth is also something that resonates to make the sound to make What's called the overtones of the sound and that really affects the overall sound so tongue position matters also look at this in the Opera style the top lip is doing something a little bit differently than it is in the other styles there's just a little bit of space being created between the front of the teeth and the inside of the lip this part is called the soft palette that can also move it can hang down let air through or it can be closed up tight preventing air from going up into the nasal cavity so the way to change your overall sound where in your body the voice is resonating is through the muscles of the neck throat the tongue lifting or lowering the soft palette what you do with your lips everything that affects the shape will affect the sound so the exercises will go over today will help to lower and relax the larynx that's the placement that we want for an American English accent now let me try to make the a vowel on the same pitch but sound different I'm going to be shifting my tongue larynx soft palette I'm going to do a bunch of different e sounds okay okay that was fun and weird it was all the e vowel and the pitch was the same but the sound changed completely throughout that that's because of how I changed my anatomy they didn't all have the American feel of that vowel which is e e I've noticed that almost all of my students have the overall feel that's just a little different the throat is a little tighter the larynx higher it makes the vibrations seem like they're pressed more in the face rather than lower in the chest in American English we want a really relaxed throat a lower larynx for that open low American sound so in this area in the throat that includes the larynx and muscles around it which move it this is called the vocal tract I found a voice coach Renee yakon on YouTube who talks about this really well when the shape of anything changes than the sound it makes when vibrating changes your vocal tract also has a resonant frequency when struck but because it can change shape and size the resonant frequency also [Music] changes so different shape different core sound now we humans have pretty much the same material as one another our blood vessels our mucus and all that that's in there but the shape we make with our throats naturally depends on the native language we grew up with and the overall sound of that language so there are two things that make up the sound of your speaking voice the pitch that is the note that my vocal cords also called vocal folds make you know what let's play with some pitches I'm going to play a middle C here on the keyboard that I have pulled up a so I'm matching that pitch my vocal cords I don't really know what they're doing I'm not telling them how to stretch but I hear something and I'm matching it let's play another pitch so again I didn't tell my throat how to change its shape I just did it based on what I hear and almost anybody can do this unless you're toned deaf you can hear a pitch and you can match it so that pitch of my voice that is the pitch of the vocal cords vibrating however there's another thing that makes up the sound of our Voice besides just the pitch when you speak you actually have two sound waves working together you have the sound wave from your vibrating vocal folds and you have the resonant frequency of your vocal tract when two waves meet you get what's called wave superposition basically the waves interfere either constructively or destructively to create a third new wave and this is the sound of of your voice the sound of your beautiful voice okay that was a lot of detail to try to convince you that the shape of your throat does matter now let's jump into some exercises to get you a more relaxed shape which will give you a more American sound the first one is super simple and just like the PT I did on my ankle it seems too simple to actually do anything but it does I want to credit these EX excises they were passed on to me by someone on my staff a Rachel's English teacher M Stokes who's getting a degree in order to become a speech language pathologist shout out to miss Stokes she's been teaching with Rachel's English for years and she's a fantastic teacher in her studies she came across a speech therapist named Shirley Tennyson who developed the exercises from the teaching of three others I'll put a link to the book with these EX exercises in the video description the first exercise is simply massaging with a circular motion you start high up by the jaw this is the jaw and you just work your way down that feels nice and you do both sides couple times get your neck muscles in the front to release now we're going to massage this part here so you put your fingers there where the base of your tongue is and you spread them apart feels good got to say we all probably hold more tension than we know we do so do that several times without talking now this one's going to feel weird so you know your larynx is here we're going to pinch above it and just pull it down the tiniest amount it's not a big forced thing do that several times and then do it also from the side nothing harsh just gentle this next one is one I used to do a lot when I was singing opera to just sort of relax and release these muscles you take your fingers on either side of the larynx and you push it side to side and it will probably crackle mine always does do that for a while maybe 10 times back and forth for the next one we're going to take our thumb and press up here into the tongue and you just press there and hold it pressing up into the back of your tongue hold it for 20 seconds maybe even up to a minute without talking and release it feels good you can feel it sink down the pressure was firm you let go it sinks down that also helps release tension now you're going to play with with actually pulling down your Lynx so gently while you're making sound and you'll see that there's a subtle change in sound depending on where your larynx is naturally the sound change will be different uh but you want to see what it feels like to have it be relaxed open and low because there's a real chance that in your native language the muscles of the neck and throat are tensed a little bit that lifts everything up a little bit and puts the sound here ah and in American English we want the sound here ah a a and we do that by relaxing everything letting the larynx lower I want to show what effect this can have on The Voice this is Shawn a student of Rachel's English Academy who could tell that his overall sound which I call placement where the voice resonates here ah or here ah I call that placement he knew that his sound was preventing him from sounding natural speaking English this is an introduction he made to the Rachel's English Academy Community early on and then we'll play another introduction that he did after several weeks of work on his placement hello everybody my name is Sean so today I'd like to make a free talk video by using the random question generator hello everybody my name is Sean so today I'm going to do a free talk video by using the random question generator he did a lot of neck tongue and throat relaxation exercises to help him find that shape of the lower resonance I'll play the two examples again side by side hello everybody my name is Shan hello everybody my name is Sean hello everybody my name is Sean hello everybody my name is Sean hello everybody my name is Sean hello everybody my name is Sean so just to recap what did we learn today the shape of our throat of our vocal tract changes our sound and in American English we want a relaxed open throat with a larynx that is able to drop down in a relaxed way that shape of the throat will make your voice feel like it's vibrating here more so than here ah ah and that's what we want that's the core sound of American English what do you think of this are you willing to try this PT this physical therapy for your American accent or maybe you think this whole thing is ridiculous let me know in the comments below don't forget to head over to Rachels english.com sfree to get my free course the top three ways to

work trip where my colleague Tom and I went to a YouTube workshop and Meetup in Salt Lake City Utah we also did some sightseeing when the events were over Tom and I had the best day ever meeting other YouTubers and even got to see a nighttime drone show that honestly was kind of cool though I will say the altitude got to me I am feeling a little bit of altitude I think my workout was rough so I I don't think I can walk very far altitude is what we call the height of something above sea level the higher you go the less oxygen in the air and that really affects some people and they get something called altitude sickness this happens to me a lot when I visit my parents in the mountains of Colorado here we were in Salt Lake city where the elevation is 1300 m above sea level elevation and altitude are synonyms meaning words with the same or similar meaning where I'm from in Philadelphia the average elevation is 340 M so that added elevation gives me altitude sickness like headaches and fatigue so I couldn't walk to lunch um so let's look at getting an Uber I'm like I'm I almost can't think yeah let's get an Uber okay I'm concerned about the not being able to think thing it's good it'll work out but yeah so we'll go we'll go to the same place but we'll take a car should prob it's like a 25-minute walk right 34 minute walk okay we're taking a car for sure while we wait for the car to arrive we discuss the weather the next day the day we fly out okay so what about tomorrow so it is supposed to be thunderstorms from 9:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. oh and we fly at 11 something I didn't check that so it's and it's like a 90% chance of rain that sucks we might get pushed that would suck it sounds like if we get pushed we might get push to like the next day that would suck this is a common casual and a little bit of a slangy way to say that would not be good that sucks that would suck I also use the phrase get pushed here I'm talking about if our flight can't go out on time and is delayed it might be delayed several hours if the weather is bad it could get delayed until the next day it sounds like if we get pushed we might get pushed to like the next day oh anything like that no I I bet they can get us out but not Direct that's going to be my hope if you're flying somewhere and it's not direct that means there will be one or more stops at another airport this is called a layover and usually you have to change planes whenever possible I always choose a direct flight about no I I bet they can get us out but not Direct W that's going to be my Hope Oh interesting but um and maybe there will be like Windows cuz thunderstorms are often like yeah patchy right Windows Tom doesn't mean an actual physical window like in a building he means a spot in time in the day when it's not raining window can refer to a range of time for example what's the pickup window for your kids school it's 3 to 3:15 yeah and maybe there will be like Windows he also said Hatchy if the storm is patchy that means it's not stormy the whole day but off and on there will be Windows of storms periods of time where there are storms but also periods of time where there are no storms no I I bet they can get us out but not Direct that's going to be my Hope Oh interesting but um yeah and maybe there will be like Windows cuz thunderstorms are often like patchy right okay so the flight's at like 11:45 11:47 yes Tom and I were on the same flight back home here we're discussing when to leave for the airport the next morning are you okay with getting there at 10:30 or is that too tight for you too tight this means not enough time to do something are you okay with getting there at 10:30 or is that too tight for you I don't know this airport I don't either would say 10:15 10:15 okay so we'll leave here at 10 10 okay or five till okay five is great okay 5 till 955 okay okay did you hear how many times we said K as we negotiated the timing short for okay agreeing with someone 10:15 okay so we'll leave here at 10 okay or five till okay five is great okay five till 955 okay okay okay I like to push it Tom likes to be there with plenty of time time to spare as they say I like to push it which means I leave as little time as possible Tom is the opposite and he likes to leave in plenty of time notice I dropped the T in plenty this is a common pronunciation of T after n Tom likes to be there with plenty of time time to spare as they say plenty of time time to spare notice the two reduction time to time to make it quick and lower in Pitch attached to time time to time to spare in plenty we dropped the T in two we change the T to a flap t or here it sounds kind of like a d du du time du it's really common to change the pronunciation of T to have smoother speech in American English check out this video where we did a full analysis of te pronunciations in a TED Talk you'd be surprised how frequently the te is changed getting this into your habit will really help you sound natural speaking English a link to that video in the video description Tom likes to be there with PL plenty of time time to spare as they say you know I consider the airport a chance to sit and read a magazine maybe or just like collect your thoughts it's a nice time for yourself as opposed to a time to panic collect your thoughts this is a phrase that we use in English to mean get control of your thoughts or feelings or emotions after something very surprising happens or very shocking for example let's say your employee comes in and says that they're quitting and and you don't know what to respond you did not expect this you might say wow okay please give me a moment to collect my thoughts but here Tom simply means to have quiet time to oneself maybe to reflect on something that's happening in his life basically just think good old thinking time and see I'd rather do all that self time at home ah yes but you can't because I can't because at home you're worried about like what's going to happen on the way like will there be a traffic jam will it be a detour do I have to get around something a traffic jam a detour basically anything that could make your drive to the airport unexpectedly longer because at home you're worried about like what's going to happen on the way like will there be a traffic jam will it be a detour do I have to get around something okay what kind of traveler are you do you like to push it like me or do you like to leave plenty of time like Tom when heading to the airport or train station let me know in the comments comments there going to be something happening at the airport that demands that I slow down have you ever missed a flight never because I once and for me for the amount of times I've flown it is such a fair trade to miss once I mean the hours saved at airports that's fair that's fair I just used the phrase fair trade what does this mean in this context it means I accept what I had to pay for what I get that seems worth it to me so yes I missed a flight once that was bad but all of the other times I've gotten to the airport with enough time to make my flight and I wasn't sitting there for hours and hours waiting for my flight so to me that's a fair trade I'd rather miss one flight every 10 years and not go extra early to the airport then go extra early to the airport all the time and never miss a flight to me missing one flight that's a fair trade for what I get which is more time at home after we went out to lunch and after the event we decided to do some sightseeing we went to analou Island State Park in the Great Salt Lake for a sunset tour it was a small tour with a friendly guide who picked us up at our hotel on the ride to the park the tour guide had everyone introduce themselves to the rest of the group okay hi everybody I'm Tom um and I am here from Lancaster Pennsylvania uh in town with my friend Rachel here who is has a camera cuz she uh runs a YouTube channel um and so we were here for a YouTube conference uh at a a YouTuber's space who works in the area the tour guide asked every person to say where they're from why they were in Salt Lake City and their go-to karaoke song if you're ever forced to sing karaoke what song do you choose my karaoke song is Billy Joel's Piano Man oh yeah such a good one great great choice thank you okay I'm Rachel from Philly and my go-to karaoke song used to be uh the queen of the knights Arya from The Magic [Music] Flute but I can't hit a high F anymore so now it is um omo Babi noo from Johnny ski by Pini wow these are classic hits on karaoke did you know I used to be an opera singer yep it's how I learned to listen to different voices to discover the music of American English we made it to the island and drove around looking for wildlife you want to take a peek yeah sure take a peek have a look check it out all way to say see beautiful bird on the left I don't know if folks here we're going to back up real quick is it close to the road or yeah right on the road hopefully I don't spook him with the beeping she said spook him this is a common reduction dropping the H in him and attaching it to the word before to Spook an animal is to scare him startle him cause him to run off spook spook him spook him spook him spook him we also saw a prong horn [Music] are you getting eaten alive I know are you did you get that what was that the prong horn Crossing I did are you getting bitten oh yeah Tom said eaten alive an expression we can use when the mosquitoes or other biting insects are bad pull your sleeves down great call but it's actually a top of my hand oh well then do this oh my gosh really yeah really we also saw some bison we saw just this one at first but ended up seeing a lot including babies it was pretty cool to see this then we got to the trail head of the short hike we would do and we even saw a faint rainbow the tour guide pointed out different features of the landscape it was sunset so the sun was really low and everything around just looked stunning it was a short hike to the end of the trail and the wind was really blowing so I I didn't get any good audio up here but I did enjoy just a few minutes in nature now let's review all the vocabulary and pronunciation we studied by watching all the clips straight through I am feeling a little bit of altitude I think my workout was rough so I I don't think I can walk very far okay so what about tomorrow so it is supposed to be thunderstorms from 9:00 a.m. 400 p.m. oh and we fly at 11 something I didn't check that so it's and it's like a 90% chance of rain thunder that sucks we might get pushed that would suck it sounds like if we get pushed we might get pushed to like the next day oh think about no I I bet they can get us out but not Direct that's going to be my Hope Oh interesting but um yeah and maybe there will be like Windows cuz thunderstorms are often like patchy right okay so the flight's at like 11 45 11:47 yes are you okay with getting there at 10:30 or is that too tight for you I don't know this airport I don't either we say 10:15 10:15 okay so we'll leave here at 10 okay or five till okay five is great okay five till 955 okay okay okay I like to push it Tom likes to be there with plenty of time time to spare as they say you know I consider the airport a chance to sit and read a magazine maybe or just like collect your thoughts it's a nice time for yourself as opposed to a time to panic and see I'd rather do all that self time at home ah yes but you can't because I can't because at home you're

What‚Äôs the secret to mastering the American English accent? It‚Äôs to learn it through real life conversation! This video takes a short clip of real English conversation and uses it to break down the secrets of the American accent. You‚Äôll be able to both hear and see what I mean! Mastering the American accent is impossible without using conversation as a tool. But it can be hard to know what to do when you‚Äôre in a conversation (or listening to one) to use it as a learning tool. The approach I use in this lesson is one that you can turn around and use to break down any recorded conversation that you have. If you‚Äôre trying to figure out how to learn the American accent you‚Äôre at the right place!

makes American English sound American and how you can improve your listening comprehension today I'm sitting down with my friend Liz while I talk about all the sports I don't like to do on vacation at the end I'll even put in an imitation training section so you can work on mastering the American accent first here's the whole conversation we'll analyze yeah but I don't like doing any of those things I don't like water skiing anymore I don't like tennis I don't like volleyball I don't golf how about running I like to run okay so that's I still have to like put in the effort to get exercise now let's do the analysis yeah but I don't like doing any of those things I don't like water skiing anymore so I do do a little break here so let's just look at this first thought group there's one word that is more dress than any of the others one syllable listen to it three times in a row see if you can find that syllable yeah but I don't like doing any of those things yeah but I don't like doing any of those things yeah but I don't like doing any of those things if you said yeah I would say that's the second one I think yeah but I don't like do doing any of those things so I think do our verb is the most stressed doing any of those things so any and things both have a little bit of an up down shape so does I so does yeah but the main one is our verb here doing yeah but I don't like doing any of those things yeah but I don't like doing any of those things yeah but I don't like doing any of those things what do you think are you with me here what sports do you love and which ones do you want to have nothing to do with let me know in the comments I love reading them and everything links together quite smoothly here we don't have any jumps or skips in the melody let's look at the linking word by word yeah but yeah but yeah but yeah yeah but yeah but so right from the ending sound of yah which I would write that in IPA this is actually a challenge for me I will say I've never thought about this word before how would I write it yeah three vowels in a row I think I would write that yeah yeah yeah yeah y y y and it links right into the B as if the B ended the word yab yab yab yab it I'm Rachel and I've been teaching the American accent on YouTube for over 15 years go to Rachels english.com sfree to get my free course the top three ways to master the American accent yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah but but but so the word but very fast and that is a stop te but but but but I almost don't even feel a vowel in there it's almost like but the B and then a stop of eror with the tongue lifting into position but but but but yeah but lots of contrast there between our long syllable and our short yeah but yeah but yeah but I don't like doing it but I don't like do I don't we've already said that I has some of that up down shape of stress it has some length I don't I don't and that iong goes right into the D no break there I don't I don't don't don't don't don't there are a bunch of different ways that you might hear an apostrophe T pronounced don't like don't like this one I'm hearing as a little stop a little lift don't like don't like don't like and that signifies the T there don't like let's listen to I don't like three different times on a loop listen to how fast the word don't is I definitely has more length I don't like I don't like I don't like don't don't don't don't very fast now I said we were going to look at all of the linking in this sentence so we have a k that's a stop consonant it's followed by d a consonant and I'm not releasing this K like doing like you don't hear that escape of air I don't like doing it I don't like doing it I don't like doing it so the K is made with the back of the tongue touching the soft pallet once that happens I go right into the D without the release like d like d like doing like like like so this also feels a little bit like a stop it it is a stop it's not like the stop te it's different the tongue is in a different position but it's a stop like doing like doing like doing like doing like doing like doing any of those things so we've had a couple stops here the Stop and butt the Stop and don't the stop in like and now we have none for the rest of this sentence it is so smooth [Music] do so the N aost the NG ending links right into the a vowel of [Music] a then the E vowel of any links right into the schah of of no break so smooth like doing any of those things like doing any of those things like doing any of those things doing any of those things doing any of those I do think that I am making the V sound here for of but it's subtle and it's fast and there's no break there's no release before the vo th those those those those I would write that with the O diff thong and a z but there's not much time spent those it's not stressed it's those those those those those those those things those things those things those things the ending z links right into the unvoiced th and because of that I think you could probably think of this as an S to make that link easier those things those things those things things if you look it up an IPA you'll see the I as in sit the NG consonant there's going to be a z but the NG consonant does change this vowel it's a little bit more like e thing sort of halfway between e and I doing any of those things doing any of those things doing any of those things so smooth let's just listen from doing to things several times listen to that smoothness listen to how fast the fast syllables are I think if you were going to try to imitate this which I hope you will you're going to have to really think about simplifying your mouth position for example for this th this voiced th you do not need to bring your tongue tip through it can touch the backs of the teeth those those those those those almost no jaw drop almost no lip rounding so fast a little bit mumbled those those those those things those things those things those things those things I should say in this conversation we're talking about this vacation I go on every year to a family camp with my extended family all of my aunts and uncles my cousins their children and there's a lot of athletic events happening there are a lot of athletic events happening but I don't really like doing any of them anymore so I think I have I've been talking here with a friend about how you know you go on vacation there's all this food around I'm hardly being physical and I just sort of feel blah on vacation those things those things those things I don't like water skiing anymore I don't like tennis I don't like volleyball so she's just said but aren't there so many sports I'm listing all the sports that happen at this camp that I don't want to do so we get to hear a lot of n apostrophe T contraction let's keep going let's hear if it's always made with a stop or if sometimes I drop it I don't like water skiing anymore I don't like water skiing anymore I don't like water skiing anymore I don't like water skiing anymore because I'm listing things my intonation is going up I don't like water skiing so it's these dips down and up any more those are our stressed usually it's up and then down but in a list we tend to go up at the end and so rather than being low with these Peaks I don't like doing any of those things I'm a little bit higher going down I don't like water skiing anymore I don't like water skiing anymore I don't like water skiing anymore I don't like water skiing anymore I don't like I don't like I'm hearing that te dropped aren't you I don't like there's no break there the N right into the L I don't like I don't like I don't like water skiing and then my my pitch is sort of flat I don't like water skiing it's a little bit higher and a little bit flatter for water water water and that is with a flap te water water water that is definitely higher than just normal conversational English if someone showed me that word on a flash card and they said Rachel say this word I would say water I wouldn't say water water but my pitch was higher here I'm fired up I'm listing all the things I don't like I don't like water water water water so pay attention to the pitch as you're imitating water SK water SK water ski water sers linking right from that schw r ending into the S no break at all no skip so smooth skiing so this is a little bit tricky we have S K and then the E vowel the ing ending is it as in sit NG but I just said up here that the NG con Conant changes the I vowel a little bit well that's what we have here and it does it makes it a little bit more like e which is the vowel we are already saying so there's a little bit of a re-emphasis here skiing skiing Ying it's almost like you put a little Y sound in between skiing only not that strong skiing skiing skiing it's different than sking which would just have a feeling of one syllable no re-emphasis but here we do have a bit of a re-emphasis skiing skiing skiing skiing anymore skiing anymore very smooth NG consonant right into the E of any my friend is clapping here and laughing because I'm kind of complaining about all the things I don't want to do seeing anymore seeing anymore seeing anymore more I don't like tennis I go right from the r of anymore into the I diff thong so I don't really put a break here even though there's a period I blow right through that and connect my words anymore I don't like tennis anymore I don't like tennis anymore I don't like tennis I don't I don't so don't is stressed and it's got a down up scoop I don't like tenis so don't and 10 are my stressed syllables here let's look at our n apostrophe t ending I don't like tennis I don't like tennis I don't like tennis don't like don't like don't like I feel a little bit of a lift there so I don't like water skiing don't like don't like or or I don't like tennis I don't little teeny lift there that is the stop that is the break of the stop tea I don't like tennis the tea in tennis tenis is a light little true tea little Escape of air I don't like tennis I don't like tennis I don't like tennis I don't like volleyball I don't like volleyball I don't again stressing don't with a scoop up I don't like what about our an apostrophe te here I don't like I don't like I don't like I don't like I don't like super super subtle little lift I don't like don't like I don't like I don't like I don't like volleyball don't like volleyball stress on the first syllable there scooping up I'm still listen in things I don't like now I want to talk about the K in like here don't like don't like volleyball in both of these cases it's a quick little stop without C that escape of air just going right into the next consonant volleyball volleyball volleyball volleyball Vol ball I really want you to think about in this dark L not lifting your tongue tip V so this is a dark L but it also comes before vowel I found that the dark L we do lift our tongue tip after making the dark sound but then I lift my tongue tip before the E vowel to make a new syllable volleyball after the word ball there is no next sound it's the end of my thought group don't lift your tongue to for that volleyball volleyball volleyball I don't golf okay I've got one more thing I don't do I don't golf let's look at that an apostrophe t ending I don't golf I don't golf I don't golf I don't golf I also would put this is a subtle an apostrophe t ending I don't with a stop t i don't golf golf this is a tricky word if you look it up an IPA you'll see the all vowel like law the L does make it a little bit more dark a little bit more closed G all all La a little more open but with the l g all all a little more closed G now this is another dark L an L is a dark L if it comes after the vowel or diff thong in a syllable and it comes after the vowel and it's not followed by a vowel so don't lift your tongue tip G you make that dark sound with the back of your tongue and then you go into the F golf I don't golf I don't golf I don't golf how about running okay so my friend's really going to help me think of something that I like to do that's physical how about how about so she goes scoop down scoop down and then up how about then a little scoop down but that's just so she can go back up how about run running and it goes down how about running how about running how about running when we have a question our question word is usually going to be stressed and that is true here how that pitch change that's how we know stressed the change in Direction how about running so two stress syllables there how and R and that verb has the uh as in butter vowel R how about running how about run how about running how about so she's dropping the schah here how about right from the a diff thong into the B so that is one way that you will hear this word reduced and that's by dropping the first syllable and it's so common with how how about becomes how about how about how about how about and this is a stop te no true te release how about how about how about running how about running how about running how about running I like to run oh good she found something I like to run so I have two stress syllables there I like to run again that has the uh vowel on it let's look at our K here what happens does it release I like to run I like to run I like to run I like to run I like to I like to no we do not release the K I like T so my tongue goes up into position for the K that cuts off the sound but then rather than releasing the air I release it into the true tea here like to like to and this is a pretty common phrase I like to I like to run I like to bake I like to do this and that and that's always almost always going to be pronounced like to like to so I hope you notice I'm putting awah there like to I like to I like to I like to I like to I I like to I like to I like to I like to run and then what do I like to do the verb run I like to run smoothly linked together run the end of my sentence coming down in Pitch coming down in energy and volume I like to run I like to run I like to run okay okay okay okay fast but with an updown shape of stress okay okay okay okay so that's so that's not quite sure what I'm going to say so I put a break there but the word so does link into that so that's and that's is stressed so that's so that's the O thong the word so is a Phil word we use it a lot when it doesn't necessarily have meaning and when we do that rather than so rather than the oong it becomes a little bit of awah so that's s so that's if I was going to use the word so in a stressed setting like I like that so much then I would absolutely do the full diff thong but as a filler word as a throw way word it's often so with the schwat so that's so that's so that's so that's so that's that's with the voiced th a as in bat vowel and an ending TS cluster so that's so that's so that's so that's I still have to like I still have to like so we've got one major Peak there I I still have to like and it's have the vo is peing up there I still have to like have this is interesting the word have ends in V but when it's followed by two which it often is these two words go together pretty frequently this changes to an F so it becomes have to half to so I would write that with the H consonant the a vowel and then the F which links right into the T half half half to have to have to I still have to have still have like have like I still have to like like like okay I talked about how so is a filler word so is like this word doesn't have meaning here sometimes like does have meaning we use it for a lot of different things but here it is a filler word it has no meaning I still have to put in the effort is the meaning of the sentence like adds nothing doesn't add anything grammatically and I say it very fast I don't say like I say like like like like like like like like I don't releasee the K like like it's just cutting off the I vowel with that K tongue position like like like like like like put in the effort put in so put in a phrasal verb and the stress is on in put in the effort to get to to get exercise ah so we have three stressed syllables here in eort [Music] exercise everything else less important either going up or coming down in Pitch but doesn't have a pitch change and linking together beautifully let's look at this put in put in those two words are linked with a flap T the vowel in put is the vowel in push is the vowel in cook is the vowel in Sugar uh put in put in the effort put in the effort put in the effort put in put in put in put in the effort okay the that word is being pronounced with an E vowel not the schah the the effort the effort the for the reason why that is is because the next word begins with a vowel and the rule is if the next word begins with a vowel then this is e the the effects the effort if it begins with a consonant then it's awah the best however I have noticed Americans are not the best at following this pronunciation rule we don't think about it here I happen to be doing it the the the effort put in the effort put in the effort put in the effort to get exercise the effort to get effort okay so this ends in schw RT efort T and then look the next word to begins with a T so you can think of those as just linking with one t effort to effort to effort to and just that real quick schah at the end effort to effort to effort to is going to be the whole word too effort to effort to effort to effort effort effort to get exercise to get exercise to get two e vowels get and e exercise and there's a flap te in between linking them get a get a get a get exercise to get exercise to get exercise to get exercise let's just write out all of that IPA we have e as in bed KS for the X exer then schw R don't really need to make a vowel there exer s i d thong and in IPA we would write it with the Z but it's a very weak Z weak weak weak you can think of it almost as being a super weak s but do not make it a strong s exercise and the voice is just coming down because it's the first syllable that's stressed everything else comes down in Pitch comes down in energy comes down in volume shaping your phrases like this will sound so so natural exercise to get exercise to get exercise to get exercise to get exercise let's listen to the whole conversation one more time yeah but I don't like doing any of those things I don't like water skiing anymore I don't like tennis I don't like volleyball I don't golf how about running I like to run okay so that's I still have to like put in the effort to get exercise in this training section you'll hear each sentence fragment twice in slow motion then three times at regular Pace each time there will be a pause for you to speak out loud imitate exactly what you hear do this training twice a day every day this week and see how the conversation Flows at the end of the week yeah but I don't like doing any of those yeah but I don't like doing any of those yeah but I don't like doing any of those things yeah but I don't like doing any of those things yeah but I don't like doing any of those things I don't like water skiing anymore I don't like water skiing anymore I don't like water skiing anymore I don't like water skiing anymore I don't like water skiing anymore I don't like tennis I don't like tennis I don't like tennis I don't like tennis I don't like tennis I don't like volleyball I don't like volleyball I don't like volleyball I don't like volleyball I don't like volleyball I don't go I don't golf I don't golf I don't golf I don't golf how about run how running how about running how about running how about running I like to run I like to run I like to run I like to run I like to run okay okay okay so so this so this so that's I have like I like I have like I still have like I still have to like put in the effort to get exercise put in the effort to get exercise put in the effort to get exercise put in the effort to get exercise put in the effort to get exercise I hope you've enjoyed this video I absolutely love teaching about the stress and music of spoken American English

don't know if there have been any nights in my life like that where I've slept zero minutes and I'm going to be honest I'm starting to get a little annoyed with everything it's not fun despite some setbacks we had a great time and David made some killer paa David should I put lemon on either of these things both of these things or is it just for show the P mhm okay look fantastic I went for the vegetarian one so the full English lesson Vlog from that trip will be coming this summer we're going to be doing lots of studying of real English conversation this summer with full analyses chatting with my friend about sports I don't golf cleaning a stain on my floor I just spilled something on my carpet unfortunately in my office right in the middle since I take a lot of road trip over the summer you'll also get an analysis from ordering at a drive-thru salt pepper ketchup in the bag and ordering dinner over the phone and peaco guacin chips oh and one side of beans and rice M just listening to that order is making me hungry one of my favorite Summer videos is all about you many of you on YouTube recorded an English dialogue for me I've already made one video using that as a teaching tool and another one is on the way going to wait not wrong but I believe in the dialogue I said all right I'm going to wait in the car going to wait GNA GNA do try to use GNA w got in spoken English they just add a very nice casual conversational tone very natural in spoken American English did you submit a video for me if so thank you I took another trip with my colleague Tom to Salt Lake City oh hey for a YouTube conference to meet up where we took an extra day to go on a tour of analou island in the Great Salt Lake where we got eaten alive by bugs are you getting bitten oh yeah

studying real English conversation today we're studying 10 conversations you'll chat with my mom my dad my uncle John we'll visit Colorado Michigan and you'll meet some of my very best friends let's get started with our first conversation this is my husband and guess what he hates watermelon um David hates watermelon he thinks I know but I want to try again you said it was the best one you've ever had I don't I didn't say that so we start here by debating what I said if someone says you said something that you didn't you can say I didn't say that I didn't say that the n apostrophe t ending can be pronounced several ways I think I'm doing a really quick stop te I didn't say that I say this phrase pretty quickly don't I I didn't say that I didn't say that I didn't say that but it wasn't too fast it was the pace of of conversational English let's listen again the clearest longer word was say I didn't say that I didn't say that I didn't say that when you listen to it on a loop it's easier to hear all the pieces you need to simplify isn't it I did not is I didn't say is the peak of that sentence say say I didn't say that I didn't say that I didn't say that you can even completely drop the tea and didn't if this helps with this simplification you'll hear it again five times then you try it don't think about the words but think about what you hear I didn't say that I didn't say that I didn't say that I didn't say that I didn't say that okay let's go back and listen to the beginning of the conversation again um David hates watermelon he thinks I know but I want to try again you said it was the best one you've ever had I don't I didn't say that would you say one of the best I probably said that I said it's an amazing watermelon and and if you're going to try it again Now's the Time to try it so we've said a few words to describe food and if we like that food David hates watermelon we can say hates we can also say doesn't like but it's not as strong and David feels very strongly about watermelon David hates watermelon I called it an amazing watermelon very good don't you love amazing food we had an amazing meal the wine was amazing I said it's an amazing watermelon and if you're going to try it again Now's the Time to try it oh you're just going to have bite of mine yeah oh so I kept waiting for him to cut a piece of watermelon but he didn't do it because he didn't want a whole piece he decided just to have a bite of mine listen to how I said that oh you're just going to have bitam mine again I feel like I'm speaking very quickly and I am but also that's just conversational English it is fast let's listen to this one on a loop and see if we can figure out which words are the the most stressed and where you can simplify oh you're just going to have vitamine oh you're just going to have vitamine oh you're just going to have bitam mine I hear more stress on oer and bite and mine oh you're just going to have a bite of mine oh you're just going to have bite of mine oh you're just going to have bite of mine oh you're just going to have bite of mine notice how all the words run together smoothly with no breaks that's an important characteristic of American English the contraction you are to your is pronounced your that's how it's almost always pronounced in conversational English that's a common reduction you're year oh o oh you're just going to have vitamine oh you're just going to have vitamine oh you're just going to have vitamine the words just going to have a we have a few reductions there the T injust is dropped we do that when the next word begins with a consonant the vowel reduces to the schah it's not just it's just going to becomes GNA have a is have a all of these words are lower and Pitch flatter and said very quickly just going have a just going have a just going have a just going have a this is what happens in conversational English oh you're just going to have vitamine oh you going to have bam mine okay oh you're just going to have bam mine bite of mine becomes bam mine the word of is reduced to the schah and the T and bite is a flap te linking the two words together bam mine Bine again these changes are typical of conversational English they're part of what helps us make English fast a tea is a flap tea when it comes between two vowels or D thongs and that's true even in two different words when the T links the two words vitamine oh you're just going to have vitamine oh you're just going to have vitamine oh you're just going to have vitamine okay let's move on David will try the watermelon will he be convinced that this is an amazing [Music] watermelon what no that's awful no David was not convinced he called it awful I have also heard him use the term disgusting what foods do you think are awful or disgusting put them in the comments what I don't get it the melon is is it the texture or the no just a flavor our friend off camera asked if it was texture or taste the texture of the food is how it feels in your mouth or in your hands it can be hard soft mushy crunchy slippery smooth and so on some people might not like a food for its texture more than its taste David said in this case it was not the texture it was The Taste the flavor is it the texture or the does a flavor it's like uh I don't know it's such a good one you guys are crazy like you literally had to spit it out let's talk for a second about the word literally and how it's used in British English it sounds more like three syllables literally literally in American English it sounds like four and and we flap the tea literally literally literally literally now this word is overused in American English the meaning has morphed as a result it's used often for emphasis for example I once heard someone say I was so tired I literally slept all day now I know that person didn't sleep all day she slept a lot of the day certainly she was very tired but she did not literally sleep all day she did not not actually sleep from sun up to sun down she slept a lot that day so she's using literally here for emphasis I can also picture someone saying I literally fell out of my chair when I heard the news this would in no way mean that someone did literally fall out of a chair it just adds emphasis to say how amazed they were how caught offg guard they were I'm going to put a link in the video description to some articles about the word literally and how its use has changed and its meaning has changed now how did I use it like you literally had to spit it out there I am using it to mean actually I'm not just adding emphasis I'm asking you had no other options than to actually physically spit it out he claims he didn't like you literally had to spit it out can you do it again without spitting it not I don't want anymore ever I'm done trying you'll never be convinced again no this is one of the best you've ever had and I had a vomit reaction is there agreement here he said he had a vomit reaction another way to say vomit is to say throw up which is a phrasal verb which means your food comes back up out of you he had a vomit reaction to watermelon this guy really hates watermelon it's an excellent melon it's a tasty watermelon this St water so there we just heard two other opinions and two other descriptors excellent and tasty everyone else seems to really like this watermelon I thought it was a a very good watermelon I I only like watermelon really this time of year when they're the real sweet juicy ones I find you know watermelon in the off season to be pretty terrible more Des scriptors very good sweet juicy also terrible in the offseason in the US when they're imported from further away I'm all in favor of this watermelon she is all in favor of watermelon she thinks it's a great one we often use the term all in favor of when we need to challenge something or part of something for example I'm all in favor of less screen time for kids but when we're flying I do let him use my iPad or I'm all in favor of exercising more but I can't make myself do it five times a week I'm all in favor of I'm all in favor of this watermelon I I'm Greatful that everyone liked the watermelon I bought the watermelon at the Woods Edge Farm Stand which is about a mile from here it started out as a guy just selling stuff that he grew sort of greenhouse greens and vegetables but now they also buy things from the Produce Auction including from farther field so this is a Virginia grown watermelon but uh from the produce auction and I found it pretty delicious how did you Che I thought it was good my friend Jacob used the phrase farther a field you can also say further a field this means not the nearest closest or most obvious place for example we didn't find a solution to the problem with our preliminary research so we'll have to look further a field or there isn't a pet adoption agency in our neighborhood so we'll have to look farther a field as Jacob used it the watermelon was not grown there on that local Farm but brought in from somewhere farther a field somewhere else in Virginia but now they also buy things from the Produce Auction including from farther field so this is a Virginia grown watermelon but uh from the produce auction and I found it pretty delicious how did you choose I thought it was good two more positive descriptors for the watermelon delicious and good so let's review our descriptors the people who liked it said it was amazing one of the best I've ever had excellent tasty very good words to describe describe not liking it were hate awful vomit reaction disgusting and terrible okay now this video is not over but since I'm hungry right now I'm going to ask you one of your favorite foods put it in the comments below and if there's a recipe involved put a link to a YouTube video where someone is making that I love watching YouTube videos of people making food like pasta Granny's and Joshua Weissman okay now that we got that taken care of let's review this whole short conversation again notice the descriptive words for food and think about how you would talk about your very favorite and least favorite foods in English um David hates watermelon he thinks I know but I want to try again you said it was the best one you've ever had I don't I didn't say that would you say one of the best I probably said that I said it's an amazing watermelon and if you're going to try it again Now's the Time to try it oh you're just going to have bite of mine yeah oh [Music] what no that's awful what I don't get it the melan is is it the texture or the no there's a flavor it's like uh I don't know it's such a good one well you guys are crazy like you literally had to spit it out can you do it again without spinning it no no I don't want anymore ever trying you'll never be convinced again no this is one of the best you've ever had and I had a vomit reaction is there agreement here excellent melon it's a tasty watermelon it's a tasty watermelon I thought it was a a very good watermelon I I only like watermelon really this time of year when they're the real sweet juicy ones I find you know watermelon in the offseason to be pretty terrible I'm all in favor of this watermelon I I'm grateful that everyone liked the watermelon I bought the watermelon at the Woods Edge Farm Stand which is about a mile from here it started out as a guy just selling stuff that he grew sort of greenhouse greens and vegetables but now they also buy things from the Produce Auction including from farther field so this is a Virginia grown watermelon but uh from the produce auction and I found it pretty delicious how did you choose I thought it was good now a throwback to when my first son was a newborn well I had a big change in my life this year so in this American English pronunciation video you're going to meet someone very special and we're going to study real life American English this is my son Stony he was born in January so he's almost 4 months old so far his life consists mostly of eating and sleeping although not sleeping too much which is why I look so tired and also meeting friends and family here he is meeting his grandma and grandpa my husband's parents he has two fingers you're going to get a mouth full of skin did you notice how my mother-in-law reduced going to to Gunna Americans do this all the time to syllables very relaxed gun do that with me gun Gunna Gunna you're going to get him you're going to get him you're going to get him you're GNA get a you're GNA get a mouth full of skin oh he definitely knows they're there did you notice the contractions Grandma used Americans use contractions all the time in speaking first they this is the contraction of they are often in conversation Americans will reduce this contraction so it sounds like the the but here grandma used the full pronunciation there when it's fully pronounced it sounds just like two other words there and there here she said there there talking about his fingers two different words but they sound the same listen again well he definitely knows they're there D there D there so did you guys have good traffic down oh we did wonderful I reduced did here so did you guys became so guys I reduced did to just the ending D and when the D sound is followed by you or your it combines with the Y sound and becomes J did you guys becomes ju guys you guys have good traffic listen again so you guys have so you guys have so you guys have so did you guys have did you is a very common word combination in conversational English pay attention as you study English and see if you notice this reduction try using it yourself do you see that do you know that ju it can also be reduced further to J with thewwa do you see that do you know that how is it to hold them oh how is it I don't know it's beyond description how is it to hold them what do you notice about the word him in this phrase how is it to hold up how is it to hold up how is it to hold up the H was dropped hold them hold them and the two words linked together with no Gap in between this is a very common conversational pronunciation of function words that begin with h like him her his have has and had how is it to hold them oh how is it I don't know it's beyond description hi in you might not have understood this phrase come on in it was all very linked together in in in two consonant to vowel links come on in come on in you can use this phrase when welcoming someone to your house come on in listen again come on in hi baby St this is your grandpa I brought you some toys oh boy I bet you did I bet you did earlier in this video you learned that when D is followed by U you can combine D and Y to make a j sound J there is a similar rule when T is followed by U or your you can combine T and Y to make CH now U will sound like Chu or you can leave in the Y sound chew also like I did here you can reduce the vowel to the schah CH beta or beta you'll hear this a lot listen again I bet you did I bet you did I bet you did in the beginning he didn't do much so we just sat around and stared at him this was okay with us it never got boring are you going to smile another Gunna are you going to smile are you going to smile are you going to smile huh we did get a couple of his first Smiles on camera the first four months have been so fun he's changing a lot kicking and he has even started talking his head's kind of big so he has a hard time holding it up some people have asked me about his name Stony it's not very common in America in fact most people say they've never heard of it or never known anyone named Stony it's just like the word stone with the St consonant cluster what do you think about your name do you like it I think he's not sure yet it has the St consonant cluster the o d thong the N consonant Stone so it's just like Stone and then a little unstressed e at the end Stony you you already know

meet my parents on top of a mountain today's Topic's words that reduce at for that's can and was and probably this oh there we go so we're at 12335 FT now yesterday morning when I got on a plane I was at about 1 foot there at New York's Loria airport so no wonder I had such a hard time catching my breath on this hike so for the metric fans of Rachel's English this is almost 4,000 M it's pretty high Americans speak with a mix of long and short syllables it's what helps make speech clear to us short syllables are often reductions words where we've changed or dropped a sound to help us say them faster let's discuss three reductions in the passage you just saw the first is the word at at has the a vowel but usually we reduce that in a sentence to the schah I can make that very fast it's abrupt because I'm making a stop T that's because the next word begins with a consonant at 12 it it at 12 we're at 12 when I make the word at very short it makes the word 12 more important this is what makes English clear listen again at 12 at 12 12 12335 ft now yesterday morning when I got on a plane I was at about 1 foot another at example I was at about one foot I was it about I was it about do you hear how I and about are clearer the middle three syllables are all less clear was it a was it a though it may seem wrong to make some syllables less clear it actually makes speech overall more clear to Americans because American English depends on this contrast of long and short syllables was it a was it a practice that with me was it a was it was it you really need to simplify the sounds and mouth movement and take some of the energy and volume out of the voice to make these syllables fast yes do that was it a was it a I was it about listen again I was it about I was it about I was at about 1 foot there at New York's Loria airport so no wonder I had such a hard time catching my breath on this hike so for the metric fans of Rachel's English the reduction of the word for for in a sentence you'll usually hear it as F how fast can you make it practice f f f listen again for the metric fans for the metric fans of Rachel's English this is almost 4,000 M it's pretty high finally the word that'ss was reduced to S it's pretty it's pretty high this is the same reduction we would use for what's or its at the end of the video follow the link for more information on the reduction it's pretty high it's pretty high it's pretty high it's pretty high very high as you can see very cold and windy yeah we just heard two more reductions the word can a helping verb here was reduced to can how fast can you make that practice with me can see listen again you can see can see you can see very cold and windy and the and reduction practice with me make it fast Colden cold and windy very cold and windy cold and cold and cold and very cold and windy yeah it's very interesting landscape mom what did that sign say about this area it said that this was once a vast plane mom reduced was she said was instead of was it's less clear isn't it was was that this was once was that's exactly what we want for these unimportant words listen again it said that this was this was this was was was was was it said that this was this was this was was was was was it said that this was once a vast plane that was pushed another reduced was that was pushed that was that was that was pushed and thrust upward by tremendous pressures of the earth wow yeah you can see some patches of snow over there did you catch that can reduction y you can see yeah you can can see some patches of snow you can see some patches of snow over there where right over there they're very dirty right that's all that's left from last year's snowfall and they'll probably get snow here within the next couple of weeks did you hear how my dad said probably he reduced it to proba proba proba probably proba and they'll probably get snow and they'll probably get snow and they'll probably get snow a real life example of the word probably at the end of the video follow the link for more information on reducing this word you can see some patches of snow over there where right over there they're very dirty right that's all that's left from last year's snowfall and they'll probably get snow here within the next couple of weeks I hope you enjoyed this cold Mountaintop study of real life American English I know it seems strange to pronounce things quickly not fully but reductions are an important part of American English follow the links here or in the description below for more information on the reductions we studied today now we'll go from the cold of the mountains to summer vacation this is my Uncle Frank hey Uncle Frank brings his boat every year so that we can try skiing did you notice the reductions of the word that and can these two function words will often reduce that becomes the with either a flap or stop te depending on the the next sound and can when not the main verb in a sentence becomes so the weaken so the weaken so that we can try skiing try and skiing the two content words in this sentence are clearly much longer than so that we can so that we can so that we can these four function words are low in pitch and very fast listen again so that we can try skiing so that we can try skiing so that we can try skiing sure appreciate that Uncle Frank well I'm glad to bring it glad to bring it here Frank reduced the word two to the flap te and the schw sound du D du glad du glad du glad to bring it listen again well I'm glad to bring it well I'm glad to bring it well I'm glad to bring it this boat is 17 years old and I was beginning to wonder earlier in the week if I was going to bring it back again here Frank reduced the phrase going to to gunana a very common reduction in in American English if I was going to bring it back g to g to if I was going to bring it back listen again I was beginning to wonder earlier in the week if I was going to bring it back again if I was going to bring it back again if I was going to bring it back again but it seems like people are still kind of interested in ski we love it love it did you hear how I connected the V sound to the word it one of the easiest ways to link in American English pronunciation is the case when one word ends in a consonant and the next word begins with a vowel or diff thong you can practice the connection between words by putting the ending consonant on the next word vit vit vit love it love it love it this will help to eliminate gaps between words in American English we want to link all the words in one thought group listen again we love it we love it we love it we'll see if it'll go a couple more years yeah I hope it does so Jace you going to go skiing today another gunana you going to go skiing today you going to go skiing today you going to go skiing today yeah I am have you been before no this is the first year yep are you nervous a little yeah it might take a couple tries so don't be discouraged if it doesn't happen right away right away did you notice how I linked the ending T of right to the beginning vowel sound of away this means that the t comes between two vowels so it becomes a flap t or a D sound so right away sounds just like right away listen again if it doesn't happen right away if it doesn't happen right away if it doesn't happen right away okay okay okay okay Meg are you going to try skiing another Gunna also notice I've reduced the word r to R listen again Meg are you going to try skiing Meg are you going to try skiing Meg are you going to try skiing I don't think so I tried it when I was 10 and I was traumatized because I fell and it hurt so I think I'm just going to stick to a bystander Haley have you skied before I've done sit SK before when I was like SI wait yeah what is that what is just like with right away we're connecting the ending T in what to the beginning vowel of the word is so the t turns into a flap t or d sound what is what is listen again what is that what is that what is that it's got the skis yeah like a chair in the middle and he's just really I've never even heard of that heard of another linking consonant to vowel herv heard of notice that I am reducing the word of to the schah V sound div div heard of I've never even heard of that I I've never even heard of that I've never even heard of that I haven't either I've done it done it another great example of linking ending consonant to beginning vowel done it done it I'm done it I'm done it I'm done it so I'm nervous to do this I think you'll be just fine I ready here Haley reduced the contraction I'm to Simply the M consonant ready of course with that reduction she linked it to the next word I'm ready listen again ready ready ready this is my cousin Brooke Brooke how are you enjoying your vacation I'm having a great time on my vacation what's the highlight of your vacation so far I think the highlight of the vacation so far is spending time with

is my Uncle Dale he lives in Texas Houston Texas and from summer vacation we're jumping into fall hey guys it's fall and I'm here with my friend Laura hey you've probably seen some of our other baking videos every fall I come up to Massachusetts where Laura lives and we make a variety of things one year we made a pumpkin pie which we're making this year but not in a video but this year we're going to focus on apple dumplings not apple fritters so if you want to learn how to make apple dumplings you should probably look it up because this is not really a recipe video but this is a real life English video where you get to study English conversation happening as it actually does so you're going to do the apples y okay I'll make the Pastry as always there are lots of reductions to study in American English did you notice Gana this is how Americans pronounce going to much of the time listen again so you're going to do the apples so you're going to do the apples so you're going to do the apples yep okay I'll make the pastry I used this reduction with another reduction you're the UR contraction your is reduced this way in a sentence you're you're going to repeat that you're going to you're going to let's hear it again so you're going to do the apples so you're going to do the apples so you're going to do the apples yep okay I'll make the pastry the ey will contraction isle is often reduced then it sounds more like all all I'll make repeat that with me all I'll make listen again I'll make the past pastry I'll make the pastry I'll make the pastry wait is this a cup yes it is you sure yeah okay I'm using this one just wait just let me see a couple of things to notice about this sentence the T in the word just was dropped we often drop the T when it comes between two consonants as it does here just let just let next let me became let me the T was totally dropped the two words let me are often pronounced together this way let me see let me try repeat that with me let me let me let me see and finally the redu uction of them to um this is another common reduction repeat that with me um um I have a video on this reduction see it by clicking here or in the description below let's do the sentence slowly together just SL me seeum just let me seeum just let me see listen again just let me see just let me see just let me see yeah they're the same the they are contraction there can also be reduced rather than fully pronouncing their it's the the th sound and the r sound the try them that they they're the same listen again yeah they're the same yeah they're the same yeah they're the same okay I just feel more comfortable using the one that says it's a cup okay the word comfortable looks like it should have four syllables but most Americans pronounce it with three I pronounced it comforable I made a video on this word already you can see it by clicking here or in the description below com listen again I just feel more comfortable I just feel more comfortable I just feel more comfortable using the one that says it's a cup okay now Laura for how many years did you train as a pastry chef 15 wow yeah that's a lot of train oh wait 15 mineus the 15 years that I didn't train neither of us are professionals here no I know it looks like we are with our methods neither neither this word can be pronounced both ways sometimes people think one way is British and one way is American but either one sounds just fine in American English okay where is the new flower in it is I had a fan write in and tell me that I don't follow the rules for the pronunciation of the word the' oh really what are the rules well and I noticed just then that I did not use it correctly the rule is if the word afterthe begins with a consonant sound pronounce itth with thewwa vowel HTH if the word afterthe begins with a vowel or diff thong then pronounce it the with the e as in she vowel e e the um thee it should be awah before a before a consonant so I said where's the new mhm but I said where's the new and I said the and you're really only supposed to do that before vowels but since that person pointed it out I noticed that I you do that do that quite a bit so it's not like it would be strange it's not strange cu no one has ever said Rachel shouldn't that be the like no native speaker has ever noticed and I didn't even think about it when you just said it no one thinks about it if you ever say the instead of the people probably won't notice also make sure to always keep this word short whether it's with the schah or the E vowel the the this is a very large bag of FL FL okay now I'm just curious how much of it can I spill I'm guessing quite a bit we have a vacuum okay oh crap crap this is a word you can use when you mess something up to mess something up is an idiom meaning to do something the wrong way or to cause an outcome other than what you intended I turned left instead of right I messed up crap is like a cuss word but less offensive still you don't want to use it in a professional setting and some people might be offended by it I think it's fine to use in a casual setting among friends crap crap this is the less offensive version of the word oh crap oh crap oh crap what was the article in that Mark was reading about trans fats I don't kn",
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
w the Atlantic I don't think so he's been on this kick for a while so okay let's go back and study the phrase I don't know I don't know notice how Laura dropped the tea all together I don't know I don't know in the phrase I don't think so there was a little break in the sound before think I don't think so the sign of a stop te but in I don't know there was no stop no tea at all this is a common pronunciation of this phrase I don't know I don't know listen again I don't know I don't know I don't know the Atlantic I don't think so he's been on this kick for a while so okay I like how you just use the idiom to be on a kick the idiom to be on a kick means to be enthusiastic about something for a period of time I'm on a yoga kick means I don't typically do a lot of yoga but recently I've done it a lot and enjoy it or you could say I'm on a salad kick I've been eating a lot of salad lately here Mark is on a trans fat Kick he's careful not to eat trans fats listen again he's been on this kick for a while so he's been on this kick for a while so he's been on this kick for a while so okay I think oh whoops before I said crap when I messed up here I said whoops which just like oops is an exclamation for recognizing a mistake this term is not offensive in any way and can be used in any context oh whoops with the same vowel as book or could whoops whoops listen again oh whoops oh whoops oh whoops how's it going Laura it's going last half nice and we're done look at those Beauties so Laura you're working on the sauce another you are your reduction I dropped the NG sound and made an n Sound on the end of working so Laura you're working on the sauce so lauro you're working on the sauce so lauro you're working on the sauce working working native speakers do this quite a bit especially with the most common ing verbs but I do caution my students against overuse pronounce ing words with the NG sound most of the time so Laura you're working on the sauce yeah it's a syrup for the top of the dumpling syrup little butter in there a lot of sugar so I'm rolling the pastry and then we'll put an apple inside another reduction of a contraction we will wheel pronounce this as wool in a sentence it's faster than wheel and we want an unstressed word like this to be very fast wool repeat that with me Wool Wool and then we'll put an apple and then we'll put an apple and then we'll put an apple inside I'm they're not as pretty as they're supposed to be but I think the flavor will be just as good as you listen to the next section listen for all the reductions and to n or n no D sound this is how we usually say this word in a sentence cinnamon and sugar then an apple half and then more cinnamon and sugar and then fold it up it's a little [Music] sticky it's been a half hour it has reduces to its how was it pronounced in that sentence it's been a half hour it's been a half hour it's been a half hour simply the TS cluster it's spin it's spin repeat that with me it's been it's been a half hour it's that and whats all reduced to the TS cluster check out the video I made on this topic by clicking here or in the description below it's been a half hour oh wow bubbling oh my God those look good I've never made this before wow yummy for real sure smells good it tastes just like apple pie mhm really good thanks guys all right lur thank you so much for helping me make this video you're welcome and until next year with Laura at our baking weekend that's it guys and thanks so much for using Rachel's English we'll keep going with food in this one you'll meet my uncle John in this American English pronunciation video my uncle John is going to teach you how to make a peach Mela in this scene my uncle is going to be listing things he's going to be giving steps listen to how he introduces each step well to make peach Mel you make a raspberry currant sauce that's what this is and you start with the current sauce at the bottom and then you add some peaches and then if you want ice cream you add some ice cream is that vanilla yep vanilla and then a little more sauce another layer huh few more peaches wow many layers a little whipped cream oo voila a lot of and and and then let's look at the pronunciation well to make peach Mel you make a raspberry current sauce that's what this is and you start with the and you start in in the word and reduced nwah n and you start and you start and you start with the current sauce at the bottom bonus reduction the word at the the at the bottom the Quick schw Stop tea current sauce at the bottom the bottom the bottom and then you add and then you add and then and then and and and again again the word and reduced and then you add and then you add and then you add some peaches and then and then and then again schw in and then and then and then and then if you want ice cream you add some ice cream is that vanilla yep vanilla and then a little more sauce and then and then and then a little more sauce another and reduction and then a little more sauce and then a little more sauce and then a little more sauce notice the word little is pronounced with a flap te little little this is a tricky word and I do have a video on how to pronounce this word so check the description below or click here and then a little more sauce another layer huh few more peaches wow many layers a little whipped cream oo voila voila is a French word but we do use it sometimes in American English VOA or Wala and when we use it in American English the pronunciation is change a little bit so it fits in more with American sounds voila voila with that lower American placement um and it means there it is here it is and you might say that when you're finished with something and you're showing it to people voila or as some Americans May pronounce it voila voila and what's the name in French PES voila wow look at that I had a pesh Melba in at Rick's Cafe in Morocco that was to die for that was to die four okay to Die four this is an idiom we use when something is just exceptional so good we use it a lot with food tastes oh it was to die for it was so delicious what's to die for what's to die for what's to die die for now she does not reduce the word to to die for she is clearly pronouncing each word stressing it bringing even more emotion in so that we understand just how good this Peach melbo was and you can reduce that word to to die for to die for we usually reduce the word for but we don't here because it's going to be the final word in the thought so we don't want to reduce it to F like we so often do in conversation leave it for to die for was to die for oh really it was wonderful yeah is that what gave you the idea to make it is that what gave you is that what gave you notice I dropped the th in that and connected it to the word before is that is that is that what gave is that what gave is that what gave you the idea to make it no we've been making it for a long time okay well there you go Teresa he made a monster he made a monster what do I mean by that we can use the word monster to mean really big have you ever heard of a monster truck when I say he made a monster I mean he made a very big portion of peach Melba he made a monster L you want that one in Casa Blanca in the movie there is a Rick's Cafe and people kept coming to Morocco and and there's another word and reduced the D is dropped we almost never say the D in the word and and and and people kept coming to Morocco coming to Morocco to Morocco the word to reduced coming to Morocco coming to Morocco coming to Morocco coming to Morocco and asking for Rick's Cafe there's another and reduction and asking and asking and asking and asking and asking for Rick's cafea bla was filmed in the United States so a rich American woman decided she was going to make a Rick's Cafe she was going to make she was gonna make going to reduced to gunana she was gonna make she was gonna make she was gonna make she was gonna make a Rick's Cafe and it's very nice restant oh really oh it's great that's fun maybe a few more peaches little actually no no more peaches actually actually this word is supposed to be pronounced with the CH sound actually and four syllables actually but you will notice that very often the CH sound is changed to the sh sound this is because we often drop the T when it comes between two other consonants so the CH sound changes to the sh sound actually actually so I'm reducing it to three syllables this is a common and an easier pronunciation I encourage you to try it a sh Lee so the middle syllable is the sh sound and then the dark L sh sh sh actually actually actually no actually no actually no no more peaches no more peaches just a little more sauce and then a little cream little little little that word's popping up a lot in this conversation a little more a little less a little bit just a little more sauce and then a little cream I'm getting pretty bossy here aren't I pretty with a flap tea I'm getting pretty bossy what does that mean to be bossy notice I'm not saying please or thank you I'm just telling him what to do that's pretty bossy that's pretty rude luckily I noticed I was doing it I'm getting pretty bossy here aren't I everyone this man right here is my cousin Kent his daughter Louisa and you've met Stony before Kent do you have anything you want to say voila you just want to make faces want to make faces want to reduced to wna you just want to make faces also the word just I dropped the T there why because it came between two other consonants just want to just wna just W dropping that t between two other consonants makes a smoother transition between sounds and we love connected speech in American English you just just you just want you just want to make faces thank you so much John you're welcome that looks amazing delicious thanks so much to my family for being in this video if you're interested in making a peach Melba I noticed my good friend hila over at hila cooking has a recipe click here or see the description below and now let's travel today we'll study some travel vocabulary phrases together as you come with me for a weekend at The Standard Hotel in New York City you'll learn phrases and vocabulary that you might use at a hotel like amenities or incidentals we'll order room service together and enjoy some amazing views first let's check in hi um I booked online uh Rachel Smith and then about an hour after I booked I booked an upgrade I'm using the verb here to book I'm sure you're very familiar with the noun version of this word book but it's also a verb which means to reserve something I booked a hotel room you could also book a table at a restaurant this means you've made a reservation you could book a venue for your wedding or a concert venue could book an act or band the bar around the corner booked my friend's band for Friday here oo makes the uh as in push vowel book uh book so both the noun book and the verb book are pronounced exactly the same hi um I booked online uh Rachel Smith and then about an hour after I booked I booked an upgrade I used the term upgrade this means to improve on something to get a higher quality for example if you've had your cell phone for a while and it's a bit slow you might want to get an upgrade here I'm using it as a noun on a flight you might be upgraded from an economy to a first class seat here I'm using it as a verb upgrade in this case I booked a hotel room and then the system asked me if I wanted to upgrade the offer seemed like a good deal to me so I did upgrade I paid a bit more money for a bigger better room and then about an hour after I booked I booked an upgrade because it was sounded very enticing what was being offered do you see how pregnant I am here I'm eight months pregnant and this was the last weekend that my doctor said I could travel away from home so we took Stony to my in-laws that is David's parents and took this short trip in the US you might hear people call this a baby moon that is a relaxing trip you take before it's harder to travel because you have a baby this is related to the term honeymoon which is a trip you take alone with your partner right after you get married you both for a water view deluxe C correct yes south facing here we're using some terms that you might use when describing a room we booked a king which means it has a king-sized bed in it king and California King are the two largest sized beds she used the term water view this simply means what you can see from your room you might have City View Park View Water view Ocean View Garden View street view this hotel is is close to the Hudson River I used the term south facing this means when you're in your room looking out the window which direction are you looking I knew I wanted to be south facing because just north of the hotel are some taller buildings I didn't want to look directly at another building so I upgraded to a south facing room you might also see a room described as a Corner Room which of course means you're on the corner of the building and you might get views in two different directions you both for a water view Deluxe King correct yes self facing yep see that here if I could just see a former by and a credit card for the sure when checking into a hotel there's a good chance that they'll ask for a form of ID like she did that would be something official with your picture and name on it like a driver's license or passport ID is short for identification they'll also usually want a credit card from you so they can make charges to the room if you damage or take anything yep see that here I can just see a form of ID and a credit card for the res sure so I see that initially you put a deposit down for the room so we would just leave the card for incidental okay no problem incidentals this is a word they use for anything in addition to the cost of the room for example if you eat or drink from the mini bar in your room they'll keep track of that and charge it to your card after you leave so we would just leave the card for okay no problem and it doesn't it's not ready yet by chance is it it is oh perfect she asks have you stayed here before Oh no I've not it's been on my bucket list Bucket List have you heard this term before it means something you want to do within your lifetime for example visiting Paris is on my bucket list oh no I've not it's been on my bucket list so I'm glad that it's happening it out right just initial here here and a signature there and if you could just add this gentleman's name right sure there might be something you have to initial or sign when checking into a hotel initial of course means you just put RS instead of your whole signature Rachel Smith just initial here here and a signature there and if you could just add this gentleman's name right sure we finish checking in and head up to our room room number 8814 we have a card as a key very dark elevator see this is why I didn't want to be North facing is because then you're just looking at a building North facing south facing it can be very handy to know the details of the room you want when booking a hotel let's go find the room there's the river and there's the [Applause] city and there's the Highline how cool is that the Highline is a park in NYC that was built on top of an abandoned raised train line I'll also talk about the Whitney which is an art museum that's the Whitney right there have you ever been to the Whitney David the new one yeah and that's their little rooftop spot there maybe we'll maybe we should go they have um Pay As You Wish entrance on Friday evenings all right well let's settle in settle in is a phrase that means to unpack to get comfortable to arrange your things in a new place after a big move it can take some time to settle in whenever we stay somewhere even if it's just for a night or two I like to spend some time settling in when we first arrive to make the stay more comfortable all right well let's settle in that night our friend Renee dropped by and we ordered room service generally you can reach the front desk by pressing zero the front desk is there in the lobby where we checked in you can call the with your needs and questions room service is for the restaurant in the hotel that can make and bring food to your room good evening good Services hi um is this where I call to place a room service order uh please hold I'll transfer you to them thank you it was the front desk not room service thank you for calling room service this is yie how can I help you hi I'm in room 8:14 mhm and I'd like to order two order ERS of fries okay and does that come with ketchup yeah okay and also two orders of a good pickle okay okay uh did you want anything to drink with that um anyone thirsty no I think we're good if you ask someone if they want something or offer them something and they say I'm good or we're good that's like saying No thank you that person does not want it anyone thirsty no I think we're good they told me it would be a 30 minute wait okay I am 8 months pregnant if that helps boost me forward okay not a problem okay I'm just kidding thank you see you soon bye I mean I'm not kidding I am eight months pregnant if that makes a difference luckily the food came quickly wow that's a lot of fries that is a lot of fries oo I didn't expect them to be so little I think we could have gotten by with one order nope no no so glad we have two mini mayonnaise all the best to go with the mini ketchup mini ketchup and then two good pickles okay what did you think of yours I give it an eight out of 10 I think I'm going to give it a six or seven oh so low do you do this too we rated how much we liked the pickle on a scale of 1 to 10 one is always the lowest and 10 the highest the very best of the best so I didn't love the pickle still there's something very luxurious about eating french fries in your hotel room at 10:30 at night many hotels have an ice machine this one was labeled an ice dispenser so almost every hotel room in America has an ice bucket that you can take to the machine to fill up this one also had tongs to serve ice into glasses David and I had such a relaxing stay here enjoying slow days before we leave let's go over a few more words and phrases that might be useful to you as you travel as you stay in hotels first when you check into Hotel you'll find the front desk in the lobby and you can probably find a luggage cart there to help you get all your luggage to your room the opposite of checking in is checking out check out of course is when you leave the hotel room and you give back your key two phrasal verbs for your travel vocabulary check in check out here I called the front desk to ask what time checkout was I also had to report an issue about the room this is Fredy hi Freddy um I am wondering what time checkout is tomorrow morning it's at 12: p.m. okay perfect uh my other question is I'm in room 8:14 and the drain to the bathtub doesn't seem to close all the way okay my apologies let me send someone up for that is that okay that's great we're actually going to head out in a minute is it okay if we're not here that's definitely okay thank you so much I used the phrasal verb head out this means to leave we were just getting ready to leave our room for a walk head out that's great we're actually going to head out in a minute is it okay if we're not here definely yeah okay thank you so much we don't even need to try to get a late checkout cuz check out's noon that's perfect this particular Hotel does have a mini bar so that is a place where they're going to have some food and snacks for you they have some glasses for us nice and there's also a refrigerator mini bar usually refers to refrigerator refrigerator and this one is fully stocked that means it came with all sorts of goodies ready for us now usually if you eat or drink what comes here in the hotel it's quite expensive much more expensive than just running out and buying it yourself another neat thing that this particular ular hotel room has is a shower bath room so it's this whole room floor to ceiling doesn't matter if you get the whole thing wet a big bathtub and then there's some slats that look out into the room so you can still see the view as you take your shower this hotel room also has a safe many many hotel rooms do so you can put passports or money valuables whatever in the safe when you leave one thing that people are often interested in when choosing a hotel is the list of amenities amenities would be things like a gym or a pool or room service other things that you get in addition to your room or special things that you might get in your room many hotels come with a little card like this this one says privacy please and you hang this on your door knob to let them know I don't want anyone to come in and work on my room or on the other side I do want someone to come in change out my towels for clean towels maybe vacuum so this card says privacy please but you might also see do not disturb thank you guys for traveling with me to New York City this weekend I also have a video that I made on travel phrases that you may use when checking in at an airport be sure to check that out are there other travel vocabulary or phrases videos that you'd like to see please let me know in the comments below big thanks to David and Renee for being in this video with me and now let's go on a road trip together today we'll study phrases and idioms and we'll do a little listening comprehension quiz as we study conversation that came up on a road trip I took with my two kids my husband and our friend [Music] Steve luck did everybody buckle up yep Steve we're buckled in I did buckle up buckle up that's a phrasal verb that means to put on your seat belt I noticed with my kids car seats sometimes I use the phrase buckle in hold still so I can buckle you in then I'll buckle up did everybody buckle up yep Steve we're buckled in I did buckle up buckle up buckle down the meaning of the phrase buckle down is completely unrelated it means to really focus on something to work hard on it I need to buckle down and study for this exam I don't feel like doing my homework just buckle down and get it done now about 4 minutes into the car ride Stony started asking if he could watch a video he knows he gets to watch one with his headphones when Sawyer needs to take his nap to help keep the car quiet the next 20 seconds of video won't have subtitles so see if you can understand what we're saying there's going to be a one question quiz at the end of the 20 seconds how long is the car ride here you can watch after lunch no what I'm going watch in the car yes after lunch we're still going to be in the car it's a long it's a long car ride uh because it's a really long trip Stony how many miles do you know David 271 that's all so 271 miles that's why we're going to still be driving after lunch okay do you know the answer how long is the car ride David said it once more clearly and then I repeated it less clearly I said it faster 271 that's all so 271 miles that's why we're going to still be driving after lunch 271 miles oh I hope this slowdown doesn't last too long one thing you hope you never have on a road trip with two small children is a delay I hope we don't hit many delays the GPS says that it's clear sailing knock on wood it'll stay that way okay clear sailing knock on wood guys David used two phrases there clear sailing and knock on wood clear sailing we use this not just with sailing but also driving to mean nothing in the way no obstacles nothing to delay us on a trip but we also use it in general to mean no problems or obstacles with the situation it doesn't just have to be Transportation it could be something like completing a project for example now that we got the new budget approved it should be clear sailing to finish the project that is we foresee no problems no issues and no obstacles arising the other phrase he used was knock on wood both of these phrases are really common have you heard them before knock on wood is a superstitious expression if you comment out loud on something that's going well you might say knock on wood as a way to say and I hope things keep going well I hope my having mentioned it doesn't mean it ends for example hey Rachel how's the baby sleeping he sleeps through the night knock on wood I've run out of gas more than once on a road trip actually years ago I made a video on another road trip where I did run out of gas all link to that video at the end of this video there's a lot to learn about American English in that lesson David and I have also run out of gas on a road trip before run out is a phrasal verb with more than one meaning it can mean to do an errand that won't take very long can you run out and get some milk or I'm going to run out and pick up the kids from school but it also means to deplete something to have nothing left I ran out of time I couldn't finish the test we ran out of gas on the highway so now I pay more attention to how much gas we have how gas just over 3/4 okay how we doing on I dropped the word r there this is somewhat common in casual English after how how you doing how we doing on gas how we doing on time how gas have you ever taken a road trip with two small kids so son's asking when we're getting out of the car how long have we been in the car the car for about 12 minutes 10 10 minutes we have about 5 hours 5 hours y so we have 300 minutes after are we there yet maybe the most common thing a kid says on a road trip is I'm hungry we going to eat lunch in here no we'll probably eat lunch somewhere outside of the car we are you going to eat because I'm very hungry you're very hungry well you'll probably we're probably not going to eat for about an hour and then it'll be a quick quick bite so we can get back on the road quick bite have you ever heard the word bite to mean meal or snack a bite is singular it's a noun this is so good do you want to bite it's also sometimes a verb I have to tell my one-year-old don't bite me but we also use it to mean food in general I said it'll be a quick bite so we can get back on the road a quick bite a meal that you hope doesn't take long I'm going to grab a quick bite and then stop by you might also hear in the phrase a bite to eat H it's almost lunchtime do you want to get a bite to eat I don't mean one bite of food of course I mean a meal David remember when we were in Italy and you could figure out the gas pump what was the deal with that it's just different from what we're used to and the you finally finally some other guy pulled up to fill up the yeah he had pity on me but I don't remember what was so different I don't either but we should we should take the camera out when we fill up okay and explain how it works cuz that's intimidating I feel like when you're in another country you're not totally sure how something like that works yeah okay so a quick rundown about getting gas in the US rundown one word this is a noun it means means an analysis a summary as two words it's a phrasal verb with various meanings but I said let's do a quick rundown about getting gas in the US let's do a quick summary there are two kinds self and full self means you pump your own gas and full means someone else pumps your gas for you and you don't have to get out of your car it's short for full service and the gas pumps will be marked self or full now almost everywhere in the US is self serve except for New Jersey where it's all full and also some spots in Oregon and a few towns elsewhere if you're at a self-served spot and you use a credit or debit card you just insert it you'll usually have to enter your ZIP code select the grade that is the quality or purity of the gas you're using and sometimes you have to flip up part of the pump if you're paying cash you usually have to do that before you start pumping so you'll find the cashier inside tell them how much you want and what is your pump number you can say something like $20 on four now when you're on a long road trip there's a chance you're going to have to stop for food we found a service plaza that's something that caters only to people coming on and off the highway and the idea is that it's faster than getting off at an exit and driving to a restaurant but it's pretty easy to get pretty terrible food there oh your beans and rice are good how's your burrito honestly the first bite was really Bland oh no okay Bland that is tasteless not flavorful not very good you can also use this to describe a person he's got a bland personality that means he's not very interesting pretty boring luckily I made Sawyer some really tasty corn puree so he was happy now if we're not eating food often we're talking about food we tried to go to L goz last night and it was so on fire like dollar I don't know but it was something they were slammed yeah so we had to bail and we went to Cedar Point which was totally empty did you enjoy it it was okay I I didn't think it was we we were not blown away were we babe what's that we weren't Blown Away were we I wasn't no Loco Pez that's a local restaurant in Phil Philadelphia Mexican inspired food Spanish inspired name with the old American twist and pronunciation did you hear some of the words we used to describe this restaurant and it was so on fire on fire no the restaurant was not burning down it was very very busy very popular we can use this term to mean really good maybe you're at a family wedding and your uncle is dancing all night he's got great moves you could say he's on fire you could say this in sports too basketball someone just keeps making shot after shot you could say she's on fire we tried to go to Lo goz last night and it was so on fire was like a dollar T I don't know but it was something they were slammed David said they were slammed so that means really busy actually you may have already learned that in a video I did earlier this month on ways to say you're busy that was one of the terms we learned slammed so we had to bail I said we had to bail that means we had to give up we had to do something different than what was planned we were going to eat there but it was so busy we had to bail and go somewhere else and we went to Cedar Point which was totally empty did you enjoy it it was okay I I didn't think it was we we were not blown away were we babe what's that we weren't Blown Away were we I wasn't no and the place we went we were not blown away blown away is a good thing you get blown away by something that exceeds expectation just dropped off our friends going to head home the final 3 minutes of the drive went well everyone's in one piece no blown no blown out tires one tipped camera however was that what's her name what is her name if you can't think of someone's name you can call her what's her name notice I'm dropping the H there what's her what's her name or what's his name again dropping the H what's his what's his name what's her name what's his name was that what's her name what is her name we made it good road trip everybody yay two more conversations now come as I do a workday on a farm in this American English pronunciation video you're going to come to a workday at this beautiful Farm we'll also study pronunciation of the letter T using kinda and the reduction of the words because and to in this video we're going to take a look at some stop T endings when a word ends in a t that's not a part of a consonant cluster that t will often be a stop for example the word out will often be out out but when that word is followed by another word that begins with a vowel it will often be a flap T because now it comes between two vowels when linked together so for example in the phrase out of out out of that t will go from being a stop in the word out to being a flap in the phrase out of these are General guidelines you will hear people clearly pronounce the full true T at the end of the word out sometimes it all depends on the habit of the speaker and how clearly the speaker is enunciating what is the assignment today what is flap T listen again what is the assignment today what is the assignment today what is the assignment today oh you can pull up some landscape fabric okay or take this break this down uhhuh or carry some wood over to the trees okay or help take the structure down okay great snip some herbs snip some herbs that sounds like the most fun out of everything that you just said did you notice how I dropped the T sound in the phrase just said sometimes we'll drop the T when it comes between two other consonant sounds for example the word exact we will say an ending true T there but when we add ly it's not uncommon to drop the tea exactly ex,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ctly just said listen again everything that you just said everything that you just said everything that you just said hi Michelle hi Rachel what project are you working on there tearing this down and destroying it you're doing a good job thanks kind of fun we should join it I should help instead of videotape right it's okay we're doing a pretty good job did you notice how Michelle said kind of she reduced the word of to just the schwa vowel and attached it to the word kind kind of kind of listen again kind of fun fun kind of fun we should join it for the record I didn't only make a video I did also help it's stuck Michelle let me help you with that hey thanks Rachel it looks like I'm really doing something yeah it's a good thing I've been working out lately working out stop tea working out lately listen again working out lately working out lately working out lately Edgar is documenting me documenting doc you documenting it's a meta documentary going on there notice how Quinn leaves off the tea in documentary do you know why you're doing that why am I doing it am I reducing it well it's t is a weird letter and sometimes after n we do drop it like in words like Center we'll say Center interview interview interview documentary documentary exactly Rachel why did you take off your hat and jacket cuz I got hot did you notice how I reduced the word because to cuz cuz cuz I got hot listen again cuz I got hot cuz I got hot cuz I got hot also did you notice that stop tea hot hot cuz I got hot cuz I got hot cuz I got hot do you remember that awesome video I made on hot back in the summer uh no I don't you actually don't need to respond I'm going to put a link to it then how can I help Rachel well we're about to need to take all of the plants that have grown on this out did you notice how I said about to and I reduced the word to to the true te and the schah sound the reason why I didn't make it a flap te is because the word before ended in a t so in this case when we reduce the word to we need to keep the true T about to about to listen again we're about to need to take we're about to need to take we're about to need to take all of the plants that have grown on this out Edgar how much time did we save you by coming to the work day save at least a month oh wow that's great great there I released the tea making the ending te a true te sound listen again that's great that's great that's great what are you going to do with that extra month I think I'll work some more get other stuff done get other stuff done thanks for having us out out there I made the ending tea a stop tea listen again thanks for having us out thanks for having us out thanks for having us out yeah thank you for coming you guys were great our pleasure ready okay that's it and thanks so much for using Rachel's [Applause] English he was quiet for the whole take I can hardly believe it thank you in this one I'm making some Vietnamese food with friends and you'll see a lot of contractions in this American English pronunciation video we're going to learn some Vietnamese cooking and you're going to study contraction of the verb to be one thing to note about these contractions is that no extra syllable is added we'll go over the pronunciations you'll notice that some of them have two different pronunciations that's because there can be a reduced pronunciation I do recommend that you use the reduced pronunciation anytime you can make a short word shorter it's going to add better rhythmic contrast to your speech so I am I'm I'm you are this can be your or better yet let's reduce it your your your notice how quick it is when we reduce it it's going to be very very fast and it must be linked to the next word we are can be where or we or better yet work work work reduced they are can be there or reduced he is she is it is this will become he's she's its notice that the s in its is pronounced as an S sound unvoiced that's because the sound before is the T also an unvoiced sound it's it's however the s in he's and she's is a z sound that's voiced because the sound before a vowel was voiced he's she's it's TS can be a tough sound and I do have a video on how to make that sound so let's take a look at some contractions in everyday conversation all right Annie so after you peel the Cucumber you're going to slice the Cucumber into rounds and then you're going to flatten the rounds and slice them lengthwise again to make it into nice julan did you notice the contraction of you to you're you're you're gonna listen again all right Annie so after you peel the Cucumber you're going to slice the Cucumber into rounds and then you're going to flatten the rounds and slice them lengthwise again to make it into nice julan how's thisin it looks good it looks good it's good how's this how's how's Z with a z sound it's good it is it's it's with that TS sound listen again how's this it looks good it looks good it's good well if we look at the way Mark's chopping his mushrooms we can see that he's doing quite a good job of it thanks Quint marks marks the last sound of Mark's name is the k sound unvoiced so the apostrophe s is also unvoiced marks marks we also heard he's where the apostrophe s is a z sound he's he's he's doing listen again well if we look at the way Mark chopping his mushrooms we can see that he's doing quite a good job of it thanks aqu Quin that's because she's a good teacher here Natalie speaking of hwen said that's that's that's because with the TS sound she's she's a good teacher Shea Shea where the apostrophe s is a z sound listen again that's because she's a good teacher well I'm GNA dice up this cucumber as I was instructed I'm going to keep dicing the mushrooms here both Annie and Mark said I'm gonna so they have contracted I am and also reduced going to to gonna I'm gonna notice how I'm is the most stressed syllable in that fragment I'm gonna that's because going is a helping verb here not the main verb the main verb is stressed for example Annie said I'm G to dice I'm G to dice stressing dice listen again well I'm gonna dice up this cucumber as I was instructed I'm going to keep dicing the mushrooms hey Annie when in the new's going to be ready they're going to be ready in about 10 minutes they're gonna did you notice how Annie reduced they to the the the they're gonna they're going to be ready listen again Annie when are the noodles going to be ready they're going to be ready in about 10 minutes I think we're all set with the basil thanks Lori we're all set did you hear Lor's reduction of we're to were were we're we're all set all set is a common idiom meaning Ready or Not in need of anything here she is saying the basil is ready for the dish I use it often at a restaurant for example when a waiter asks if there's anything more I need nope I'm all set I'll say listen again I think we're all set with the basil thanks Lori I love hwiin she's such an Effective Teacher that's true hin thanks so much for teaching us how to make all this amazing food thanks for coming and joining me to eat all this wonderful food anytime we will eat your food anytime yes we will love it she's she's she's such with the apostrophe s pronounced as a z that's that's true with the TS sound listen again I love hakin she's such an Effective Teacher that's true hin thanks so much for teaching us how to make all this amazing food thanks for coming and joining me to eat all this wonderful food anytime we will eat your food anytime yes we will love it I'm crushing it over here as you may be able to see he's crushing it I'm adding noodles I'm adding tofu I'm waiting for shrimp I'm adding bean sprouts I'm lots of I'm in this clip also Mark used the idiom to crush meaning he thinks he's doing an excellent job making a summer roll there are lots of different ways to use the word Crush for example to say you have a crush on someone means you like that person you have romantic interest in that person let's listen again to all these I'm contractions I'm crushing it over here as you may be able to see he's crushing it I'm adding noodles I'm adding tofu I'm waiting for shrimp I'm adding bean sprouts that chicken's looking good all right that chicken's looking good nly contracted chicken is to chickens that chicken's looking good and it was good it was delicious listen again that chicken's looking good there is there's no in there wait where's the onion go into the oil oh spring onion there's no onion in there where's the onion there's wees both of these words end in the r sound a voiced consonant so the apostrophe s is a z sound there's theirs wees wees there's no onion where's the onion listen again there is there's no onion in there wait where's the onion go into the oil oh spring onion Annie hold it up is look at that that's absolute perfection it does look great you've got to love Annie's enthusiasm that's absolute perfection that'ss that'ss again with the TS sound listen again Annie hold it up is look at that that's absolute perfection it does look great oh God my dogs are barking why is that Hillary we've been walking around all day not to mention all the dancing you did last night oh it was amazing my dogs are barking this is a great idiom to mean your feet are tired my dogs are barking notice how the word r is reduced to R my dogs are my dogs are my dogs are barking notice also the ing is pronounced as an i in my dogs are barking instead of dogs are barking you may find this happening sometimes with certain phrases or idioms listen again oh God my dogs are barking why is that Hillary we've been walking around all day not to mention all the dancing you did last night oh it was amazing I hope this has made you more A Ware of just how often we use this kind of contraction watch this video a time or two then watch an American TV show or movie and see if you can notice these two B contractions write them down as you watch and practice the phrases using contractions will really help your speech sound more natural that's it and thanks so much for using Rachel's English guys that was fantastic which one of these conversations was your favorite

heard hey guys hey guys hey guys hey is a very common greeting in American English hey guys as well often used to address a group of friends hey guys uh Hey guys hey guys hey guys all connected part of one phrase one idea we don't really feel separate words here hey guys so just one big upd down smooth and connected phrase hey guys hey guys hey guys hey hey hey Monica says Hey really clear falling off there little up at the beginning and hey falling down in Pitch chanders is much faster hey hey hey hey hey hey hey but this is the general way that we pronounce statements a little up and then falling off of Pitch hey hey hey guys hey hey hey hey hey hey what's in the bag what's in the bag what's in the bag here we have a really good example of stressed and unstressed words in American English what our question word and bag our noun are both stressed what's in the bag what's in the bag what's in the bag if you love this kind of in-depth analysis of American English pronunciation I really encourage you to check out my online courses at Rachel's English academy.com we have one on all sorts of different Hollywood scenes there are over 50 there to choose from from movies from TVs and in all of them we take a scene we study it we do that in-depth pronunciation anal analysis together the best part though is each video comes with an audio soundboard so you can train the little mini phrases yourself and really get it into your voice you can see it you can see it you can see it you can see it and when you listen in slow motion it helps you really hear the Rhythm the stress and the linking so be sure to check out Rachel's English academy.com let's get back to our scene what's in the bag what's in the bag what's in the bag what's in the bag so longer on what's and bag and in the said very quickly also there's no separation here it's one thought everything is linked together it's really important to know in American English that we have stressed and unstressed words and the unstress words are said very very quickly so we don't want them to all be clearly and fully pronounced we want in and thee to be in the in the in the so fast a little quieter what's in the what's in the what's in the what's in the what's in the so what's a little bit longer a little bit louder and also bag a little bit longer a little bit louder and the up down shape of stress what's in the bag what's in the bag what's in the bag what's in the bag m M just a little M sound as he's thinking just some presents just some presents two longer syllables one is just just some presentence and then the other one is pre so they both have a change of Direction this is one of the ways that we show a stressed syllable just some present just some present just some present notice the T and just is dropped it's really common to drop a t between two other consonants and here it's between two s's so it's just some just some no T connecting with a single s sound just just just also notice the word Su is not pronounced Su but it's some it said very quickly it's one of these unstressed words in IPA I would write it with the schah which is an unstressed fast sound some some just some just some just some just some just some just some presents just some presents just some presents just some presents very smooth no breaks between words this linking is one of the characteristics of spoken English it can make it hard to understand if you're expecting every word to be clearly pronounced and separate from other words the more you study with me the more we study American English pronunciation the more you'll get used to this and the easier it will be to understand native speakers just some present just in present just some present notice the s in presentence is a z sound Z PR pre presence Pres present present come on show us what you bought come on come on really fast on the word come come on and then more length on the word on come on come on sometimes you'll see this written C apostrophe m o n come on that's how much we might take the vowel out of that first word and just link the M into the next word so it's k sound C on come on come on come on come on come on show us what you bought show us what you bought da da da da da so for studying the Rhythm to make this easier to understand then we see show us what you bought we see that show and bought are our stress words and us what you are unstressed flatter in Pitch softer in volume and said more quickly show us what you bought show us what you bought show us what you bought so the three unstressed words I what you I what you I what you not very clear on their own only clear in the whole sentence so us what you we have a stop te here in the word what what what what a what you it's what you it's what you it's what you but see if you can really simplify your mouth movements and just imitate this what you it's what you this what you in order to match that pace it's not going to be what you think it's not us what you but this what you is what you is what you we aim for that to be less clear because that's the only way to make it fast enough and it needs to be really fast so we have contrast with the stressed syllables because that's actually what makes English clear to us that's that's what you bought bought bought and another stop to the end there what is a stop t a stop T is one that doesn't have t that released T sound bot bot we stop the air at the end bot in our throat or just with the tongue position bot bot but it's different from ba where there is no consonant at the end this is bot and that abrupt stop even though it doesn't have t is what sounds to us like a stop t I have lots of videos on the stop te you can search Rachel's English stop te to find them but but but you know you want to you know you want to so he slows it down he exaggerates things a little bit you know we've got a down up there for our stressed word or verb you know you want to and then another stressed up down on the other verb want you know you want to you know you want to you know you want to but it's important to note the smoothness here when he slows it down we really hear how each word links into the next one with no break you know you want to that's exactly what we want every time we speak English want to notice T that there is a little bit of a crisp true tea there so different than the stop T here we do hear t t a little bit of that release you know you want to you know you want to you know you want to okay okay this is a word that can have either first syllable stress or second okay here he kind of does both okay make sure you're doing a diff Fong two different sounds oh your lips have to round a little bit more towards the end of that to get the full sound oh okay okay okay okay okay okay so the next time he says that we have a more clear second syllable stress okay okay okay okay okay this is a picture frame from Ben to my parents let's listen just to this part of the sentence a couple times see if you can feel that some words are longer louder and higher in Pitch than others this is a picture frame this is a picture frame this is a picture frame this is a picture frame picture we have some up down stress there pict sure frame and then up down both these changes of pitch both of them are what we use to show stress pick frame it's different than the other words that are either flatter or just moving in One Direction like up towards the peak of stress this is a this is a picture frame when we have a change of direction of the melody that signals a stressed syllable this is a picture frame this is a picture frame this is a picture frame so this is a less important faster let's listen to just these three words this is a this is a this is a this is a this is a this is a this is a can you do that that quickly simplify your mouth movement as much as you can make sure it all links together smoothly the S links right into the I of is and then this which is actually a z sound links right into the schah is a is a is a is a is a this is a this is a this is a this is a this is a this is a not very clear right when we take these unclear unstressed words in a row and we listen to Just them we're like hold on that's so unclear and actually sometimes I'll play this for a native speaker and they can't understand it but then when I play them the whole phrase they totally get it this is a picture frame this is a picture frame this is a picture frame this is a picture frame the T here is actually making a CH H sound picture picture picture it might sound like an sh to you picture picture but in the dictionary you'll see the symbol for the CH sound which is written like this if you look up the phonetic symbol picture picture frame picture frame picture frame picture frame from Ben from Ben if I slow that down from Ben I find that both of them are stressed from Ben then he goes up a little bit to show he's not done well who's it for it's from Ben but who's it for he's going to keep going from Ben from Ben from Ben to my parents to my parents to my parents so all linked together sounds like one word One phrase and it's just one scoop down and up to my parents parents why do we have so many phrases that are going up at the end the general pattern is the phrase goes down at the end well the phrase will go up the pitch will go up at the end if we want to Signal the we're in the middle of a thought we're going to keep talking like here or if we're listing things like here he's just finished one thing and now he's going to list more so when you're listing things each thing goes up until the last one goes down to my parents so let's just listen to this little phrase one more time to my parents to my parents to my parents to my parents pair so that's our stress syllable everything else is faster to my is actually to my to my to my so a little true tea and then awah that's a reduced vowel it's not to but t t so we can say it really quickly to my to my to my to my to my can you make it that fast to my try it right now to my to my parents to my parents to my parents to my parents cute Monica says a a really clear up down shape it's cute it's cute the word that is reduced just to the TS sound and the TS sound is attached to cute it's cute it's cute it's cute isn't it funny the word that's it and also the word lets can all reduce this way to just the TS sound attached to the next word it's cute it's cute do you notice I'm not saying cute I'm not releasing that t Monica doesn't release that T it's a stop T cute so a t is often a stop te at the end of a phrase or if the next word begins with a consonant it's cute it's cute I got some I got some I got some I actually love this so much because it really shows our linking some uh like this is the thinking sound but it sounds like m because the M links into the vowel we link our words together so much that we even link words into sounds that aren't words like this thinking vowel I got I got I got some so if there's just one thing you take away from this I hope it is is linking linking linking I got some uh I got some uh I got some uh I got I got I got those two words link together quickly we have a stop te it's not I got it's also not I got sort of tapering off into nothing it's got an abrupt stop that's the stop te I got I got I got some uh I got some uh I got some uh I got some uh hers and hers towels hers and hers towels going up towels he's going to talk a little bit more about them also we've got two stress words hers and hers and they both follow that pattern up and down the word and reduces it's a little unstressed word in there where we actually drop some of the sounds hers and hers house hers and hers house hers and hers house hers and hers so it actually sounds kind of just like n and it links them together the Z links right into the N which goes right into the h no break at all hers and hers hers and hers hers and hers hers and hers now keep in mind with the word hers that it's got this vowel that looks like the letter three sort of in IPA and it's the r vowel it's the r sound in vowel form her it's also an earth it's in girl so you don't need to try to make a vowel sound that's really separate from the r just from the h her into an rlike vowel sound hers hers hers and hers hers and hers hers and hers hers and hers towels for Susan and Carol towels so he actually doesn't really put a break here he keeps going for Susan and Carol so the two proper nouns the two names also have stress for suan car so they both have first syllable stress sue Care and are two other words that are less important that are faster they both reduce they both have sounds that change so this is not pronounced for and it rarely is pronounced for in conversation but what is it let's listen first first first for for so not for but for for for here how it's flat it's lower in Pitch it's not very loud there's not a ton of energy in it it's f f f so in phonetics in IPA I would write that with an f and a schw r these two sounds blend together so you can think of it as just being no vowel f f for for Susan for suan in the word Susan the first letter s is an S the second letter s is a z s is tricky in English because sometimes it's an S sound and sometimes it's a z sound for Susan for Susan for Susan and Carol just like here with hers and hers we have Susan and Carol and again the word and reduces to just the end sound Susan Susan actually the sound before is an N so think of it as like awah n or you can think of it as being the word in susanin susanin Susan and Carol but it's definitely not and fully pronounced is it Susan and Carol Susan and Carol Susan and Carol and uh and uh okay now here he's thinking he's drawing it out a little bit more and now this same word that was reduced in a whole thought now that it's on its own isn't reduced it's fully pronounced and uh but do you hear that it links just like some and the D links right into that thinking vowel uh this is the sound we make in American English when we're thinking when we're feeling uh or um and different languages have different sounds that they make when they're thinking for us it's uh this really pure open relaxed vowel and IPA we would write it like that uh and uh and uh and uh and uh I got this blouse for Mom now let's listen to the rest of his phrase and listen to it three times see if you can feel which word are the most stressed I got this blouse for Mom I got this blouse for Mom I got this blouse for Mom I got this blouse I got this blouse a really fun Rhythm here so short for ey but then got has some length I got I got I got so it's not I but it's I like seriously how fast can you make that I I I got I got and it links together smoothly we have a little bit of a break there a little lift so we feel that stop for the Stop tea I got I got this and then this again is low is quiet there's less vocal energy in it I got this and then we go up again for blouse so unstressed stressed then unstressed stressed I got this blouse D do da da I like sometimes to just say phrases on their Rhythm D dot dot dot so I can really feel it I think it's a fun way to break down the language I got this blouse I got this blouse I got this blouse I got this blouse a blouse is a shirt it's a top but it's dressier than a t-shirt for example something a little dressier now I see we have the word for and I'm wondering are we going to hear the whole word for or are we going to hear a reduction I got this blouse for Mom I got this blouse for Mom I got this blouse for Mom for Mom for Mom it's definitely not for Mom but for Mom it just links right into that word it's just part of that one up down shape that we've got for mom so we're peing on stress here for our noun and the word for is just sliding up to it and it's reduced drop that vowel f f f and I don't want fur I want fur fur so fast for Mom I love it when I'm working with students in my live classes and we're working on reductions and they get it but they're still making it twice as long as they need to because then I can say no not fur but f f and once they start shortening it like that oh my gosh they sound so natural speaking English for Mom for Mom for Mom for Mom R Ross Ross so her pitch is higher this shows elevated excitement Ross it also has a couple different pitch changes Ross Ross Ross that is gorgeous that is gorgeous that is both said quickly that is that is that is she's not linking them with the flap tea which she could she's making that a stop te that is that is but they're both said really quickly before more length on Gore gorgeous one up down shape of stress first syllable is stressed and the second syllable just Falls away from that peak of stress gorgeous and this is a we' got a lot of vowel letters here just think of it as I is is is gorgeous like in Kiss gorgeous gorgeous that is gorgeous that is gorgeous that is gorgeous yeah yeah yeah he doesn't open his mouth much for that it sounds a little trapped yeah but we know what he means the intonation going up here this time it's asking a question so the intonation goes up to Signal we're not done with a thought if we're listing things or if we're asking a yes no question that's what's happening here yeah he's asking for confirmation like oh wow you really think it's gorgeous you think she'll like it of course Monica is being sarcastic here she does not think the Mom will like it she does not think that the blouse is gorgeous at all she thinks it's hideous she thinks it's terrible what do you think of the blouse would you wear it giving gifts can be stressed right let's listen to the whole conversation one more time hey guys hey hey what's in the bag just some presents come on show us what you bought you know you want to okay okay this is a picture frame from Ben to my parents a that's cute I got some uh hers and hers towels for Susan and Carol and uh I got this blouse from Mom boss that is gorgeous yeah thank you so much for studying with me I love doing this kind of scene analysis if you like this kind of

30 day vocabulary challenge to start 2021 right we're learning 105 words from the academic word list so these are words you'll need to know if you're preparing for the ielts or toefl exams but also if you read or watch the news in english or have conversations with native speakers these are intermediate words and you're going to study them in real situations so your understanding of them will go beyond just memorizing a definition so grab your friends have them join in on the challenge and let's do this as always if you like this video or you learn something new please like and subscribe with notifications i'd love to have you as my student during these 30 days we're learning 105 words together i do have a download for you a list of all the words with definitions and sample sentences as well as quizzes to make sure you're really getting and remembering these words you can get that download by following this link or the link in the video description our first word today is achieve achieve second syllable stress and just the schwa in the first syllable make that as quickly as you can achieve it's a verb it means to get or reach something by working hard to become successful or reach a goal they achieved high scores on their math tests let's look again up close and in slow motion a cheese a cheese achieve achieve and now we'll go to euglish to see five examples of this word in context and i can't wait to see all you will achieve in the months and years ahead all that you will achieve everything you'll get for your hard work for example a degree a career financial stability and so on and i can't wait to see all you will achieve in the months and years ahead here's another example i'm helping other veterans achieve something and and that's like therapy for me other veterans achieve something reach their own goals when he sees other veterans succeed it makes him feel great i'm helping other veterans achieve something and and that's like therapy for me let's see another example and if you and if you achieve success you can be incredibly proud of yourself if you achieve success if you work hard and reach your goal it makes sense that you would feel proud sometimes i think the harder we have to work for something the better we feel when we get it and if you and if you achieve success you can be incredibly proud of yourself let's look at another example people will still need to be motivated and organized to achieve a certain set of goals and objectives people need to be motivated and organized achieving success and reaching goals is not necessarily easy for example if your goal is to master english you might need a plan structure this month i'll study grammar i'm going to work at it one hour a day next month i'll study real english conversations learn idioms and expressions and so on organizing the work you'll do to achieve your goal people will still need to be motivated and organized to achieve a certain set of goals and objectives our last example because i felt like it would be a faster way to achieve our goals a faster way to get what you're working for what could that mean let's say your goal is to save ten thousand dollars maybe you have some extra time so you pick up a second job because i felt like it would be a faster way to achieve our goals our next word is potential potential a three syllable word with middle syllable stress a true t there to ten potential potential it's an adjective capable of being real possible she would do a great job running the company she's definitely a potential candidate for ceo as a noun it means a chance that something will happen or exist in the future the drug has potential to treat covid19 but we need to do further testing let's look again up close and in slow motion potential potential potential potential and now we'll go to euglish to see five examples of this word in context i'm standing here today to tell you that your potential is timeless your potential is timeless that means it won't go away the chance that something in you will become great will achieve success won't go away won't fade over time i'm standing here today to tell you that your potential is timeless here's another example i've got anywhere from five to maybe a hundred potential students potential students people who may sign up for a course for example i might say the wait list for my private lessons is pretty long i've got a lot of potential students i've got anywhere from five to maybe a hundred potential students let's see another example we know of at least two potential cases in florida two potential cases in florida two cases where this might be true in this case it was early march 2020 and they were discussing the coronavirus there were two sick people in florida showing symptoms they hadn't gotten the test back yet but there was a chance that they would be positive there is potential for them to have the coronavirus we know of at least two potential cases in florida let's look at another example and i'd say you should start brainstorming potential topics and get started as soon as you can brainstorm potential topics she's talking about a term project here for her class a brainstorm is when you try to think of as many different possibilities for something as you can perhaps through a group discussion or just by doing it yourself writing down every idea that comes to you to see if an interesting idea or solution comes to mind so she's saying that the students should start thinking now of potential topics topics they may end up choosing for the main project for this class and i'd say you should start brainstorming potential topics and get started as soon as you can our last example but it also has the potential to give us some pretty cool science has the potential what they're studying may become may end up being some pretty cool science they don't know yet they don't know now they need to do more learning and exploring but what they see here now is potential as they learn more it could end up being something really special but it also has the potential to give us some pretty cool science our next word is impact impact impact impact as a noun it means the act or force of one thing hitting another or a powerful influence or effect the impact of the baseball hitting the glass broke the window gandhi made a major impact on the world but we have another pronunciation and it's for the verb form impact impact now we have second syllable stress as a verb it means to have a strong effect on something or someone the pandemic has impacted almost every area of life let's see this word again up close and in slow motion impact impact impact impact impact impact impact impact and now we'll go to euglish to see five examples of this word in context and they can have a severe impact on our life a severe impact a strong impact for the worse a strong negative effect and they can have a severe impact on our life here's another example so when i got to college and i started learning those things that made an impact for me made an impact for me it's also common to use on and say something made an impact on you when he learned new things in college it changed him influenced him so when i got to college and i started learning those things that made an impact for me let's see another example if we're too gentle then we don't make any impact if we're too gentle then we don't make any impact remember impact is force power if something is too gentle then it can't change or influence something or someone if we're too gentle then we don't make any impact let's look at another example here's a really good example of how a very tiny design element can make a big impact a tiny element can make a big impact can really influence and change things here's a really good example of how a very tiny design element can make a big impact our last example so how is all of this impacting your bottom line impacting your bottom line bottom line is a term used in business to mean the balance sheet the finances the profit for example the coronavirus really impacted the revenues the bottom line of restaurants as they couldn't do in-person dining so how is all of this impacting your bottom line our last word today is construction construction a three-syllable word with middle syllable stress your first and last syllables should be said very quickly can construct construction a noun the act or process of building something such as a house or a road construction of the new hotel will begin in the spring let's see this word up close and in slow motion one more time construction construction construction construction and now we'll go to euglish to see five examples of this word in context that kind of construction is not not as easy perhaps as it is today that kind of construction the way that was built the process used to build that that kind of construction is not not as easy perhaps as it is today let's see another

how is everybody i'm seeing lots of people in the chat tell me where you're from i colombia we have juan diaz from columbia hello juan we've got someone in sweden welcome greg so glad to have you here ernesto from russia welcome to you thank you guys so much for all being here it's great to see you hi gabrielle we have brazil we have anderson from brazil and wagner from brazil brazil is is a big is a country that is a big supporter of rachel's english we have argentina iraq colombia taiwan whoa now they're going so fast i can hardly read them ukraine italy peru algeria spain india japan costa rica haiti wonderful so great to see you guys all here i saw some mexico there you know i visited mexico earlier this year i was in baja california with my family in january and february and now that the coronavirus has hit the idea of traveling like that feels so far removed from where we are now although i would love to be there we have syria germany kurzican egypt guatemala bangladesh brussels belgium somaliland uzbekistan ethiopia this is awesome guys isn't it the dominican republic bulgaria to have everyone here together learning together i love it okay so the format of this live lesson is going to be the same as it has been for the past few weeks we're going to watch a video together um this one is from a road trip i took with my family and we go over lots of idioms that come up as we talk about various things of course in american english we use idioms so frequently and it can be pretty tough to follow you might understand the vocabulary words but you don't understand what the idiom together those words together means so we're going to go over some of those this today this week i want you to throw your questions into chat yemen ukraine istanbul [Music] tunisia i want you to throw your questions in the chat i'm going to do my best to keep an eye on them as they come in so now without further ado let's go ahead and start that video oh i have one thing i have to do first hello okay i did it great all right let's start the video oh i have to shrink myself i don't want to be in front of the video so much to consider when you're running a live stream thank you guys for being here and for being patient with me as i figure out what i'm doing are we there yet today we'll study phrases and idioms and we'll do a little listening comprehension quiz as we study conversation that came up on a road trip i took with my two kids my husband and our friend steve [Music] all right people get hurt did everybody buckle up yep steve we're buckled in i did buckle up buckle up that's a phrasal verb that means to put on your seat belt i noticed with my kids car seats sometimes i use the phrase buckle in hold still so i can buckle you in then i'll buckle up did everybody buckle up yep steve we're buckled in i did buckle up buckle up okay now everybody out there do you wear a seatbelt what is the standard in your country in the u.s it's the law to wear a seat belt so we do we do our best to do it and of course with the kids we do it all the time and actually we we also do it all the time it's a very strong habit i feel like now when i see people not wearing a seatbelt i think oh my gosh it just seems so dangerous whereas you know 40 years ago 50 years ago a lot of cars didn't even have seat belts so that's a little bit crazy someone's asking what's the best dictionary so i do want to talk about that i use a variety of dictionaries i don't think you should limit yourself to just one i often use dictionary.com and the cambridge dictionary of american english every once in a while i'll reference merriam-webster or mcmillan or something like that so i think it's a good idea to have a couple favorites and everything you do you check two different places at least you'll sometimes see a difference in opinion about pronunciation they'll use different symbols for the ipa sometimes they use their own and then you just get a slightly different definition you might get different example sentences and that's just going to help widen your understanding of how to use that word of what that word means so that's what i would say to that i do think use an online dictionary whenever possible because usually you can click a button and hear the word and i think that is a brilliant way to study it in general some of them sound a little bit robotic but some of them sound quite natural and that's a good way to practice so no one answered my question if they wear a seat belt oh yes okay someone says fasten your seat belt fasten buckle up buckle in let's all be safe okay guys let us keep going and learn some idioms together buckle down the meaning of the phrase buckle down is completely unrelated it means to really focus on something to work hard on it i need to buckle down and study for this exam i don't feel like doing my homework just buckle down and get it done now about four minutes into the car ride stoney started asking if he could watch a video he knows he gets to watch one with his headphones when sawyer needs to take his nap to help keep the car quiet the next 20 seconds of video won't have subtitles so see if you can understand what we're saying there's going to be a one question quiz at the end of the 20 seconds how long okay so everyone out there a quiz is coming i want you to really focus on it and see if you can answer the question um also someone asked me to speak louder is it quiet is it too quiet is every is anyone out there having a hard time hearing me i guess i can hunch down a little bit more a little bit closer to the microphone i didn't check my settings ahead of time but i can see here on the screen it looks like it's pretty much matching the quality of the audio levels of the video so i hope that you guys can hear me alright so we're gonna go listen to the quiz everyone get your your listening ears perked up is the car ride you are here you can watch after lunch no what a lunch and a car yes after lunch we're still gonna be in the car it's a long it's a long car ride uh because it's a really long trip stoney how many miles do you know david 271 that's all so 271 miles that's why we're gonna still be driving after lunch okay do you know the answer how long is the car ride david said it once more clearly and then i repeated it less clearly i said it faster 271 that's all so 271 miles that's why we're gonna still be driving after lunch 271 miles oh i hope this slow down doesn't last too long one thing you hope you never have on a road trip with two small children okay 271. did you guys catch that the first time through i'm also curious to know oh cindy got it monica got it mustafa got it jean lorena oh a lot of you guys got it someone said 207 271 that's right wow you guys you guys all have great ears look at that the chat is blowing up with all of your right answers oh someone converted it to kilometers that's awesome we don't generally tend to think in terms of kilometers although we do have road races that are in kilometers so it's funny you know everything we do is in miles but when we talk about a race we might say a 5k or a 10k k standing for kilometers so we do still we do do that we do do road races in kilometers but we do everything else in miles oh my green screen is messing up a little bit shoot all right yeah you guys got it so do you guys do road trips where you live is this a thing i remember i was talking to somebody from switzerland and i said that you know i used to live in boston and i took voice lessons in new york and i said they said oh that seems like a long ride and i said uh it's only it's only four hours and i remember she said if i drove four hours i'd be in like be like three countries over or something so what what is it like where you are is this something you do do you do long road trips or would that just take you to who knows where okay i'm trying to fix the screen screen and it's not really i'm not really fixing it so i apologize that there's a little bit of green going on in the corner sun went behind a cloud again um but yeah let me know in the chat i i love road trips monica says we do so many road trips in finland ooh i would love to do a road trip in finland have you guys ever been on a road trip in the u.s we have obviously it's a huge country and there's so much so many different regions to see different you know way the trees grow in the earth i remember when i was in california i was just looking out the window like wow the trees were so different and i was talking to a friend who grew up there and i said what's that tree i said it's that is such a cool tree and she looked at it and she was like really it was just a normal everyday tree to her she'd seen it every day of her life she didn't think it was interesting at all but for me i had never been around a tree like that i thought it was so neat and so special i love that about travel you see things that you never saw before and then of course when you have people with you that are traveling to where you live then you get to sort of look at your place in a new in a new light see it in a new way because of someone else's comments like wow that tree is amazing but yeah i like a road trip someone likes my silver hair you know it's getting more and more silver as the quarantine goes on and on who knows when it will end okay let's keep going with the video we're about to learn some idioms here tell me in the chat if you've heard these idioms before a delay i hope you don't hit many delays the gps says that it's clear sailing knock on wood it'll stay that way okay clear sailing knock on wood guys david used two phrases there clear sailing and knock on wood clear sailing we use this not just with sailing but also driving to mean nothing in the way okay did you guys know these have you heard these before clear sailing and knock on wood let me know in the chat um also someone says you know when i'm saying the word road trip that it sounds like i'm saying trip with a ch and that person said is this a normal way to pronounce that t how many of you know the answer put it in chat if you've been studying with me for a while you've probably heard me say it's not normal for just t but for tr for that cluster it is very common to make that a chr it's probably more common than making it a tr sound trip trip that is less common than trip trip so the tr cluster does become a chr make sure you don't drop the r the ch doesn't replace it but try all these words with me now try trip are you doing it with a ch train can you do all those with me what are some other ones tr put any tr word that you can think of in the chat trial trek so good ear to the person who noticed that the t in trip sounded like a ch okay so the idioms smooth sailing and knock on wood smooth sailing i'm about to explain that here in the video no obstacles nothing to delay us on a trip but we also use it in general to mean no problems or obstacles with the situation it doesn't just have to be transportation it could be something like completing a project for example now that we got the new budget approved it should be clear sailing to finish the project that is we foresee no problems no issues and no obstacles arising the other phrase he used was knock on wood both of these phrases are really common have you heard them before knock on wood is a superstitious expression if you comment out loud on something that's going well you might say knock on wood as a way to say and i hope things keep going well i hope my having mentioned it doesn't mean it ends for example hey rachel how's the baby sleeping he sleeps through the night knock on wood i've run out of gas more than once on a road trip actually years ago i made a video on another road trip where i did run out of gas i'll link to that video at the end of this video there's a lot to learn about american english in that lesson david okay am i the only one who's ever run out of gas on the road on the highway or it doesn't have to be on the highway just in the city if you've ever been driving and you ran out of gas while you were driving please let me know in the chat say yes i ran out of gas so that i know i'm not the only one out there that did it also i saw some other great tr cluster words coming in i saw treasure i saw truck i saw another one that i can't remember right now whoa my light but yes i want to know if anyone else has run out of gas because i did it was very embarrassing i was traveling travel i was traveling with four other people and then we had to call other friends who were on the same road trip to come bail us out to come bring us gas so it was a little embarrassing to do that but you know it happens i don't claim to be the best driver i am far from the best driver you know i hardly ever drive anymore living in new york for eight years will really change how well you drive because you just lose that skill a little bit i lived in boston for like five years then new york for eight so all in all it was over a decade that i didn't own a car and i was hardly driving at all then i moved to philadelphia and david had to drive me everywhere so i did get better at driving again because i had to be independent but we both prefer when he's driving let's just put it that way so mu talib ran out of gas thank you martha never ran out of gas okay she's really good at keeping an eye on the gas gauge okay a couple other people have run out of gas that's awesome thank you guys you're making me feel like it's just a little bit more normal someone said i had a close call once but it didn't actually happen luckily j cj no jc did run out of gas okay it happens we're all human right that kind of thing happens i'm not the only one all right let's keep going knock on wood is the idiom that we just talked about and it it's something you do superstitious that you say or you actually do you actually knock on wood when you've just said something that's positive that's good and you don't want it to end for example the example i used the baby is sleeping through the night knock on wood you don't want to mess that one up all right let's get back to the video i have also run out of gas on a road trip before run out is a phrasal verb with more than one meaning it can mean to do an errand that won't take very long can you run out and get some milk or i'm gonna run out and pick up the kids from school but it also means to deplete something to have nothing left i ran out of time i couldn't finish the test we ran out of gas on the highway so now i pay more attention to how much gas we have how many gas just over three quarters okay how are we doing on i dropped the word r there this is somewhat common in casual english after how how you doing how are we doing on gas how are we doing on time have you ever taken a road trip with two small kids so suny's asking when we're getting out of the car how long have we been in the car you're in the car for about 12 minutes 10 10 minutes we have about five hours five hours yep it can get long but really the boys did great some of you have asked about english books videos songs and so on to expose your kids to english one thing that stoney loves to do is listen to audiobooks so now is a great time to talk about audible who has so kindly sponsored this video i've really gotten it okay let's take a break there again sorry for my green screen over here poking up some green um so i should have edited this out but there is a an audible shout out here and actually i want to let you guys know that this code is still good for audible so if you haven't already taken advantage of it i'm actually listening right now to an audiobook i'm listening to michelle obama's book becoming and she does it herself it's her own voice she wrote it and then she recorded the audio version of it and it's awesome and she speaks really clearly and that could be a good book for you no matter what your skill level is i think that you could find that you understand most of it but let's just go ahead here and listen to the plug for

excited he was about that book he was listening to laurie brickner he loves laurie berkner she's a songwriter and a singer that does kids music and actually he met her at a library in florida and it was one of the happiest moments of his life ever she signed a book for him and he got to watch her perform and he got to sit on her lap afterwards and meet her it was very very exciting for him visit audible.com rachel'senglish or text rachel's english to 500 500 in the u.s after are we there yet maybe the most common thing a kid says on a road trip is i'm hungry did i eat lunch in here no we'll probably eat lunch somewhere outside of the car we are gonna eat because i'm very you're very hungry well you'll probably we're probably not gonna eat for about an hour and then it'll be a quick quick bite so we can get back on the road quick bite have you ever heard the word bite to mean meal or snack a bite is singular it's a noun this is so good do you want a bite it's also sometimes a verb i have to tell my one-year-old don't bite me oh sorry i also use it to mean food i made myself big um so it's just it's so sweet to see stoney this wasn't even that long ago it was a year ago but he's like so much bigger now and of course his hair is super long and floppy right now because none of us know how to cut hair and so he has not been to get a haircut since the pandemic broke out but it's kids are always wanting to eat and always wondering how much longer we were in the car for all of 10 minutes before he's asking when we're gonna eat and are we there yet i'm sure all of the other parents out there can understand it's it's just the way that it is they get in they get buckled in it's exciting to start a trip and then you start it and you start to wonder what's coming up next it gets boring really quickly doesn't it all right let's keep going with the video i said it'll be a quick bite so we can get back on the road a quick bite a meal that you hope doesn't take long i'm gonna grab a quick bite and then stop by you might also hear it in the phrase a bite to eat it's almost lunch time do you want to get a bite to eat i don't mean one bite of food of course i mean a meal david remember when we were in italy and you couldn't figure out the gas pump what was the deal with that it's just different from what we're used to and the you finally finally some other guy pulled up to fill up me yeah he had pity on me but i don't remember what was so different i don't either but we should we should take the camera out when we fill up okay and explain how it works because that's intimidating i feel like when you're in another country you're not totally sure how something like that works yeah okay someone in the chat said in russia they have the phrase spit over your left shoulder equal to knock on wood being something that you do if you're superstitious about something ending someone says what does it mean keep going well keep going just means don't stop like if you are working on a project you're doing a good job someone might say oh that's great keep going keep going with that idea for example someone says that knock-on wood is similar to an arabic expression and someone said in russia they also use knock-on wood what i also saw maybe portuguese that you guys use that phrase knock-on wood there someone says why do you use gas instead of petrol or diesel i also saw someone asking about the word fuel so definitely in america we use the word gas for what you put in your car petrol i think is more british but i'm not sure but we don't use that ever and we don't really use fuel either i mean it makes sense we know what it means but it's just not what we use we just use the word gas now diesel is different we do have diesel as well when you are at a gas station there will be some pumps that pump regular gas and some pumps that pump diesel depending on which kind of engine you have so i don't know why gas is the preferred word that we use in american english but it is what we use for what you put in the car to make it go thank you guys for putting your questions in chat they're always interesting to see and they help me figure out what to talk about so keep those questions rolling in okay let's keep going with the video so a quick rundown about getting gas in the u.s run down one word this is a noun it means an analysis a summary as two words it's a phrasal verb with various meanings but i said let's do a quick rundown about getting gas in the u.s let's do a quick summary there are two kinds self and full self means you pump your own gas and full means someone else pumps your gas for you and you don't have to get out of your car it's short for full service and the gas pumps will be marked self or full now almost everywhere in the u.s is self-serve except for new jersey where it's all full and also some spots in oregon and a few towns elsewhere if you're at a self-serve spot and you use a credit or debit card you just insert it you'll usually have to enter your zip code select the grade that is the quality or purity of the gas you're using and sometimes you have to flip up part of the pump if you're paying cash you usually have to do that before you start pumping so you'll find the cashier inside tell them how much you want and what is your pump number you can say something like twenty dollars on four now when you're on a long road trip there's a chance you're going to have to stop for food we found a surface okay before we get to that have you ever been on a road trip or driving a car in a different country and something that's just as simple as getting gas can be so intimidating and confusing i feel like and this is what happened to us in italy we were in italy and david was trying to pump gas and he could not figure out how there was no one around so we just kind of sat there and waited and about 10 minutes later someone came to pump gas and you know david doesn't speak any italian maybe one or two words but luckily he was able to figure it out with this guy who helped him figure out how to pump the gas but i just it seems like something like that would be more universal more easy to figure out but we just we couldn't we had no idea how to put gas in the car when we were traveling in italy so it can happen but there's a little rundown on getting gas in the u.s someone says what about the kitchen oven gas yes we do call that gas too for example your stove top can be gas or electric or you could be say something like i smell gas maybe you're afraid there's a gas leak so we do use the same word for that what you use to make a flame on your stove same word that we use for what you use to fuel your car do you know the other term for it the other way we use the word gas we also use the word gas for farting i feel funny even saying that in a live stream but maybe you know this flatulence when you've eaten something it gives you a stomachache it's working its way out there's some extra air you could say i have gas so why is the word gas used for that many things i don't know then we also have the three states solid liquid gas so solid ice for example liquid water and gas steam so we use the word gas to mean lots of different things don't we it's sort of fun to get to know all of them all right let's go back to the video i'm still laughing about having mentioned that taught that it's okay though right it's english we gotta know these words this plaza that's something that caters only to people coming on and off the highway and the idea is that it's faster than getting off at an exit and driving to a restaurant but it's pretty easy to get pretty terrible food there oh your beans and rice are good how's your burrito honestly the first bite was really bland oh no okay bland that is tasteless not flavorful not very good you can also use this to describe a person he's got a bland personality that means he's not very interesting pretty boring i made sawyer some really tasty corn puree so he was happy now if we're not eating food often we're talking about food we tried to go to local okay so before we get to that part of the lesson where we're going to be learning some more idioms i saw someone esteban from costa rica said he was trying to get gas on a road trip to yosemite and had a lot of problems at the gas station but apparently figured it out i think you ended up making it there someone says could you teach initialisms do you know what initialisms are it's when we call something by the letters like for example cbs is one of the tv networks here in the u.s i don't even know what the c stands for something broadcasting service but i'm not sure what the c is for so initialism is when you call something by its letters like that cbs nbc and what we do there is we stress the last letter c b s n b c someone says i am bland i don't believe that bland is the opposite of tasty it can also be the opposite of spicy someone says cvs asap sos right these are all initialisms and we always stress the last letter do you guys know the word bland have you used that what is a food that you think is particularly bland or maybe you know a person who is particularly bland someone has come up karina has come up with another initialism tgif that's right thank god it's friday or thank goodness it's friday someone says blend versus bland so blend would be when you mix things together you blend them and then bland is this word that i mentioned where there's no no taste blend e bland someone says do you save your live stream yes it will end up on the youtube channel okay someone else said the initialism wtf bff these are all really good ones tbt throwback thursday yes so probably what the person was asking about with initialisms was can i come up with a bunch of them and teach them someone says cnn karina you're you're suggesting fomo now the thing that's different about that is we're not actually saying f-o-m-o in that case we make a word and we say fomo this is true also of nasa so we take the initials but then rather than saying n a s a we actually make a word out of them like nasa like fomo someone says omg ceo btw these are all awesome ones ussr lgbtq plus right exactly so we have so many of these initialisms and some of them we say the letters cbs and some of them we say that we make a word out of them nasa i'm seeing gop lol scuba wasn't an illusionalism it no longer is someone says i didn't know that that's interesting nih aka also known as have you ever seen an initialism and you didn't know what it meant and had to look it up i actually have done that too someone bulat has suggested the one goat greatest of all time g-o-a-t now that's another one where we don't say the words like cdc center for disease control we don't say the letters as words but we put it together into its own word goat goat oh you guys are coming up with a bunch of great ones dm for direct message usa ufo unidentified flying object someone says when do you use tbt so there might be more than one meaning for that i've seen the meaning throwback thursday and it's when people on social media on thursday post a photo that isn't current maybe you post one of yourself when you were a kid or something and it's just a fun way to bring up old memories tbt throwback thursday nyc my favorite city all right let's keep going guys now we're about to get into some more idioms and ways to describe different things last night and it was so on fire i don't know but it was something they were slammed yeah so we had to bail and we went to cedar point which was totally empty did you enjoy it it was okay i i didn't think it would that's a local restaurant in philadelphia mexican inspired food spanish inspired name with the old american twist and pronunciation did you hear some of the words we used to describe this restaurant and it was so on fire on fire no the restaurant was not burning down it was very very busy very popular we can use this term to mean really good maybe you're at a family wedding and your uncle is dancing all night he's got great moves you could say he's on fire you could say this in sports too basketball someone just keeps making shot after shot you could say she's on fire we tried to go to logo okay do you guys know that phrase had you heard it before to be on fire what else could we say a soccer player maybe he does a hat trick he scores three goals we could say oh he's on fire today um okay a couple of questions come in someone says what time is it right now in your place it's 4 30 in the afternoon someone else said rachel what's your favorite food and that's impossible to answer but i will say some food that i really like is szechuan and there is a restaurant here in philadelphia it's a chain they've started opening them other places so i know that there's one in new york or there was it's called han dynasty love their food i'm already getting very excited thinking about it szechuan do you guys did you notice i used the word chain chain is what we use for a restaurant where there's more than one so for example maybe you have a local diner and it's the only one like it the owner the name of the place just just happens once but then you'll have a chain like mcdonald's where there are hundreds probably thousands maybe even hundreds of thousands i don't know but there are so many mcdonald's but then you might also have something like this one in my neighborhood han dynasty where it's a very small chain it's a local chain right they have them they have five or six but they're all here in philly then you could call that a local chain but that's what the word chain means when we're talking about a restaurant you can have a national chain a local chain or you could say it's not a chain restaurant it's the only one like it it's my local restaurant someone else said rachel can you tell me what you think about what is happening in minneapolis regarding george floyd well i think it's very horrific it's a huge problem and i think that the country needs to do a lot of work to prevent this from happening i think that we need to have a clearer set of rules about what is and is not acceptable for a police to do in any given situation where that police feels threatened i mean i don't know what it's like in other people's countries but in the u.s it's not uncommon for someone to be hurt by a police officer when the police officer was using excessive force or even did it o,
 accident thought misinterpreted a situation so i think it's yeah i think it's terrible and i i hope that our country can move towards a different place and you know i am looking for organizations to support that are doing that kind of work i think it's a tough dialogue it's a hard dialogue and it's worth having and it's important to have it and we must have it so that's what i think do you guys like talking about current events in english or do you find that you prefer to talk about just more conversational topics i know that current events are often news oriented sometimes politically oriented and i'm just curious what what do you like when you're working on english is that is that kind of thing does that kind of thing feel very interesting to you or do you prefer to learn things and talk about things the way you would maybe with a friend or something more conversational hey how are you what did you do last night or do you really like the news kinds of topics the current event kinds of topics let me know because you know i don't do a lot with current events and i definitely could do more life is happening all the time and of course with the internet we're learning about so many things so quickly the news cycle has gotten much shorter there's a lot to keep up on um but thank you guys for the question someone says police in norway don't even carry a weapon you know i've heard that that's interesting i mean the the culture is so different there someone says politics is a heavy subject and might be too off-putting for some people that's probably true someone says not politics no matter what someone will hate you that is very true i have generally stayed away from politics on my youtube channel for that very reason it's such a touchy subject and i feel like in america anyway we've gotten less good about being able to talk to somebody who has a different opinion we've become the word that you might hear is very polarized that means we're at two very opposite ends of the spectrum and there's not much in between and we we don't want to compromise and we find it hard to debate each other because it it just gets so heated so impassioned there's so much anger and frustration someone says in new zealand cops don't carry weapons either i didn't know that someone else says that news topics this person likes news topics because it's a way to gain new words and ideas i think that's totally true i think that's very fair but as monica points out political topics are controversial couldn't agree more all right let's get back to the video learning some idioms people and it was so on fire i don't know but it was something they were slammed david said they were slammed so that means really busy actually you may have already learned that in a video i did earlier this month on ways to say you're busy that was one of the terms we learned slammed so we had to bail i said we had to bail that means we had to give up we had to do something different than what was planned we were going to eat there but it was so busy we had to bail and go somewhere else and we went to cedar point which was totally empty did you enjoy it it was okay i i didn't think it would we were not blown away were we babe what's that we weren't blown away were we i wasn't no and the place we went we were not blown away blown away is a good thing you get blown away by something that exceeds expectation [Music] just dropped off our friend okay let's just talk about blown away blow away so blown would be past tense blow is present and i could say right now you guys blow me away you showed up here you're sticking with me through this long live lesson it's so fun to see you in the chat and to see what you have to say i'm blown away you blow me away can you think of a way in which you could use that what's something that blows you away a movie could blow you away a book a concept a performance a game anything that it exceeds your expectation can blow you away so a couple questions coming in in the chat someone says that they heard that americans like to talk about politics is that true um i think it really depends i wouldn't i would say in general i think i don't really know other countries how much they talk about it that much but i do think it's a fairly common topic in the u.s to talk about politics the direction of the country what's happening especially when you have a president who is polarizing i've already used that word but some people really love them and some people really hate them and there are not that many people who have remained sort of neutral or whatever about it unless there are people who just don't care about politics at all and are not reading the news at all hearing the news on what's going on most people have a strong opinion there okay now i believe the video that we're watching together is almost over and here you get to see i'm in the driver's seat so look out let's just finish it up i'm gonna head home the final three minutes of the drive went well everyone's in one piece no no blown out tires one tipped camera however who's that what's her name what is her name [Music] if you can't think of someone's name you can call her what's her name notice i'm dropping the h there what sir what's her name or what's his name again dropping the h what's his what's his name what's her name what's his name who's that what's her name what is her name [Music] we made it good road trip everybody yay that's it and thanks so much for using rachel's english that's not even my ending anymore i don't know why i did that been crazy all right there we are the end of the video thank you guys for joining me with that thank you for the questions that came up in chat it's just very interesting for me to read them you know when i make a video and i post it out there you guys often feel very far away from me but when we go over a lesson here together and i get to see you in the chat and you've shown up and you're here then i feel like i know you a little bit more it feels more like a dialogue and not a one-way thing so thank you davi ferreira asks do you speak another language um not really i mean [Music] i can get by with spanish when i was in mexico i was using my spanish i studied spanish in college i lived abroad in graduate school and actually in college i studied german and i lived abroad i i lived longest there in germany and austria so i probably at one point knew that language better than spanish um i went when i went to italy two years ago i studied some italian so i really enjoy it but i would say i've lost this most of the speaking skill that i at one time had from lack of practice from being in the us and not interacting with native speakers ever but it's good incentive to travel we had so much fun when we went to mexico in january and we've decided we want to try to go again next winter too so maybe we'll make that a regular thing where we can choose spanish as the language we're going to try to get better at and make the effort to be in spanish-speaking countries and work on that skill because i think it's important and it's interesting and i think for me as a language teacher it's important to experience the other side of that someone says what about french i have studied french actually i had a great time traveling in france for a week and using you know this audio course and getting by with the little that i learned but i really love languages guys i love the sounds of them i love the expression i love the way people use their voice and i really commend all of you for being here for learning about english in english i mean that's hard you've got to be pretty advanced to do that so congratulations to you guys and i think that's going to be it i'm going to wrap it up here you know i'm going to go have my han dynasty tonight i'm going to eat my szechuan food that i love so much and i'm gonna enjoy it i hope that you guys all have a wonderful weekend thank you so much for being here with me i appreciate it thank you for giving me your time and i'll see you at the next live stream which will probably be next week but be sure that you check my youtube channel my notifications sign up for my mailing list if you haven't already because i will post it there and that way you can be in the know make sure,TRUE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

in English while training your vocabulary thinking in English why because if you don't have to translate in your head anymore you'll be able to join into the conversation faster and speak more naturally then today we're going to train with visual flashcards I recently made a video on thinking in English and we had different steps that we could take so today we're going to take one of those steps and we're going to go deep on it we're going to train your mind on that one step visual flashcards naming objects to train your mind to think in English and probably you'll come across the word or two that you don't know so we'll also work on building your vocabulary as we go now if you like this video or you learn something new please do subscribe and like it it really helps the strategy we're going to use today is naming objects in English and we're going to use our visual flashcards this is the first step in training your mind to think in English we're going to take a picture and you'll be prompted to name different things within that picture you won't see the word written you won't hear it in your own language you'll just have the picture and your mind will recall the word in English we're going to strengthen that ability to think in English by concentrating on it with simple objects if you see an object and you're not sure of the word for it don't worry at the end we're going to go over each word so that you can learn the vocabulary that you don't already know we're gonna build your vocabulary too and because you learned it with a picture you'll have a visual for it and that's gonna help you remember the word if you already know all the words great then this is just a practice in seeing something and recalling the word in English training your mind later in this series we're gonna train you on sentences and engaging in conversation let's practice remember you're going to see something and you should name it in English in your head you don't have to say it out loud just think the word ask your mind to get into English mode and to let go of your native language a lot of these will be words that you know so you can see it think it see it think it build that connection to thinking in English you what was that like for you was it easy if so that's great that means you're already well on your way to having the habit of thinking in English I'm gonna see if I can stump you with some vocabulary later in this video if that was hard for you don't worry wherever you are your starting point is okay and the training starts now doing this doing the training is how you will get better let's review the words now I'll say it out loud in case you don't know the word you can hear a native speaker saying it see the object hear the word repeat the word in your head think it fox paw snow okay so this is how it's going to go we're going to train your mind to think in English let's go to the next picture you were there any words there you didn't know don't worry in the second half of this video we're going to go over all the words but for now we're just going to go through a bunch of scenes in a row with objects for you to name some will be pretty easy and some words might be harder a little bit less common don't get frustrated if you can't do all of these that is your starting point and by investing the time here now you're taking your first step to improving alright let's do it you how are you doing I'm checking in on you are you doing okay we're halfway through let's keep it up you are you still thinking in English great okay let's review there might have been some words in there that you don't know umbrella awning that one's less common ivy did you know that plant chair bicycles or maybe you just said this singular bicycle sunglasses arena or maybe you said stadium court or basketball court Jumbotron or maybe you just said screen crowd or you could have said fans or maybe just people astronaut Earth pitcher wineglass tea cup lamp neck backpack sky or maybe you said clouds huddle or maybe you said team huddle is the word we use when you put your arms around each other like this and gather in a circle ponytail pizza slice olive crust rosemary did you know this herb beer or maybe you said mug garlic mushroom tomato pepper bouquet bride or maybe you said woman groom or maybe you said man it's their wedding day so they'll often be referred to as bride and groom kilt smile or maybe you said teeth fingernails or maybe you said nail polish lemon this is also called a lemon wedge phone or maybe you said picture pillow ring sparkler dog tail leash purse jean jacket classic pants shorts path or walking path grass shoe shoelace or maybe you said bow rock or stone soul this part of the shoe is the sole and it's a homophone with the word s o UL the sound exactly the same ok did you learn some new words were you able to keep your mind going in English if this was easy for you great that means you're well on your way to having the habit of thinking in English you're comfortable with it and maybe your English vocabulary is quite large in the next videos in this series we're gonna have you responding in full sentences describing in as little or as much detail as you can what you see and then later you'll also have to respond to conversational prompts right away thinking in English as much as you can if this was hard for you don't worry you can build the skill by doing it walk into a room look at the objects name them in English if you don't know them look them up learn the definition and then remember the

forget being a non-native speaker americans can't even get these words right today we're going to go over 14 of the most commonly mispronounced words in american english the other night i was watching netflix it was a documentary ugly delicious episode two and i saw a native speaker completely mispronounce a word i don't know if putting it into the echelon of high dining excuse me i actually had to go back and turn on the subtitles to make sure he was saying the word i thought he was saying but mispronouncing it i don't know if putting it into the echelon of high dining he was how is that how is it that americans mispronounce words in their own language it's because sometimes we learn words from reading not from hearing them used and english is not a phonetic language the letters do not correspond one to one with the sounds so we can see a word and guess the pronunciation and maybe be wrong someone who reads a lot may learn lots of words that they've never heard pronounced so it's actually really easy for native speakers to mispronounce a word this word is echelon not echelon but echelon was a good guess because the ch can be pronounced ch or sh in this case it's the sh sound not the k k sound but there'd be no way to know that just by looking at the word so the first word today is going to be echelon try that with me echelon by the way if you're wondering what the heck these symbols are they're the international phonetic alphabet symbols they match up to the sounds of english because the letters of english don't if you want to know more about them if you want to learn them for american english i'll put a link to my playlist that goes over them below oh my gosh you guys i just went to uglish just to see if i could find anyone else saying echelon i typed it in and i found another guy mispronouncing this word only mispronouncing it in a different way i did not expect to find that into the higher echelon of party leadership so he said echelon with the ch sound also a good guess also not the way that word is pronounced so that word only has one pronunciation listed in the dictionary and it's echelon echelon if you're unfamiliar with the word echelon it means a group or level within an organization or a larger group we're looking to hire the best people who are in the upper echelons of their fields the other day i was talking to david about the metropolitan opera i said it's so cool to live so close to such an upper echelon opera house hearing the wrong pronunciation of echelon on netflix got me thinking about the words i've mispronounced in my life so i posted to facebook to ask my friends about words they've said incorrectly or weren't sure how to say maybe because they learn them from reading one friend said chaos he thought it was chaos the ch letters making a ch sound again those letters ch they can be tricky just like in echelon so here we'll study a list of words i've heard mispronounced by native speakers i've mispronounced them myself or my friends have admitted to mispronouncing this one is from my friend lol reading out loud in class in the sixth grade he said [Music] salud okay so he mixed up the l and the d and he also didn't make a k sounds schedule schedule so s c h is often s plus k sound like in school but not always for example when it's followed by another consonant then it's going to be an sh sound like schlep schlep has two meanings to haul or carry something i have to schlep my groceries up for flights of stairs or it can be a tedious or long journey it takes me an hour to get to work on the subway and i have to make two transfers so it's a schlep now the word schedule that's the word that my students have requested a lot so i do have a video that goes over how to pronounce that word in detail i'll link to it at the end or you can see the link in the video description here i found one that even the guy in the dictionary mispronounces acai it's [Music] acai now i get it when words come to us from other languages it can be really hard but come on this one is written with stress on the last syllable it's acai not acai do you know this it's a berry supposed to be very very good for you often put in smoothies and yes i've definitely heard americans pronounce this akai i mean with the letters that pronunciation would make sense in english but it's acai this next one i have definitely mispronounced before just like lol did with schedule i think we mispronounce it because in our minds we switch some of the letters we think it's spelled like this so we say mischievous but it's not that it's mischievous it's not hard to find examples of people mispronouncing this word that suggested a mischievous side tasty kids sitting in a basement doing something mischievous and loads of mischievous fun probably any of the very mischievous ones being somewhat mischievous mischievous but remember no that's not it that's wrong it's just three syllables it's mischievous mischievous if you're not familiar with this word it means playful but maybe doing something a little bad my new puppy is a little mischievous he's always eating my shoes now this one again for some reason some native speakers add an extra syllable the word is [Music] triathlon yes i myself am guilty of mispronouncing this word i used to say tria adding an extra syllable after th triatha triathlon i bet if you polled 10 americans at least half of them would think that that's how it's pronounced they'd probably misspell it too putting in an extra a and competed on the triathlon team let's do a triathlon bit or you're doing a triathlon or something like that a half ironman triathlon but it's not four syllables it's three try af athlon triathlon a triathlon is a race swimming biking and running all right the next one is an example from my own life i was in the 10th grade geography class i can't remember what i was talking about but i used this word facade but that's not how i said it i said fake hade barricade cascade decade vacate made sense but that's not the pronunciation facade the c is the s sound that's not uncommon it's s in lots of words like circle and city facade i have two friends who said they were unsure of how to pronounce these two words [Music] vague and [Music] vogue vague and vogue kirk wasn't sure if vague should be vague or vague and he says he still gets nervous saying it but it's a like in day say way a vague is the right way now catherine worked in fashion so i'm pretty sure she figured out how to say vogue but i can see how the u and e at the end makes this pronunciation a little confusing vague and vogue something that is vague is something that's not clear not clearly defined stated or explained i'm trying to put together some furniture but these instructions are pretty vague if something is vogue then it's popular or fashionable i can't believe scrunchies are in vogue again speaking of that u-e at the end of a word like vague and vogue what about this word [Music] q that looks like too many letters doesn't it my aunt said she had heard different pronunciations of this word and she wasn't sure how to say it so she had to look it up so if you're a non-native speaker and you're feeling bad about not knowing the pronunciation of a word when you read it don't worry native speakers have that same problem this word is q just like saying the letter q out loud q it also has the same pronunciation as this word q q is a line queue up to try to get tickets to the show q is a signal c-u-e for example if you're at someone's house in the evening and they keep yawning that might be your cue to go home i have two more with q-u-e my sister-in-law said she used to think this word [Music] was antique but that's not it it's antique and a friend of mine once heard someone say this word as buddha q but it's not it's boutique so does every word that ends in i q-u-e pronounced this way antique boutique critique physique unique no not quite we also have applique and communique so they don't all follow that rule an antique is something that's old maybe rare high in quality used to describe furniture from another era this antique desk belonged to my grandmother a boutique describes a small fashionable business a boutique hotel for example doesn't have a lot of rooms and each room is really individual and tastefully done our next word is artisanal my friend said she once had to correct a smart smart friend who had said artisanal stress can be tricky there aren't many rules about it this word does have second syllable stress artisanal something that is artisanal is something handmade often in a traditional way artisanal bread artisanal cheese something handmade in a small batch different from something made in a factory artisanal next is [Music] cognac my friend emily said i said it loudly at a party and the room got very quiet i thought it was pronounced cognac i can see why she thought that look at the letters cog neck but it's cognac cognac cognac is a very high quality brandy next is [Music] draft this word is confusing because it looks like it should be the pronunciation of this word drought the one with oh you is pronounced drought the one with a you is pronounced draft draft is common because beer in kegs is called draft beer and a lot of people prefer drinking that to beer that's bottled or canned drought with oh you is a long period with little or no rain and then there's another word that sounds just like draft but it's spelled differently d-r-a-f-t which means something that's not in its final form i wrote a first draft of my paper draft drought draft and what is up with this word colonel where's the r this is the only word in english that i can think of that has an r sound but no letter r the letters of this word make no sense for the way it's pronounced a friend of mine told me she pronounced this word colonel of course it makes sense in a presentation in school i think many people have that same story a colonel is a rank in the military colonel and finally so we need it now i can never say this to shire we have the word worcestershire this word is so weird i actually talked about this in a previous video let's check it out this is one of the few cases where we're actually retaining british english pronunciation this sauce was first made in the city of worcester england sure is the british equivalent to our counties here in america so this sauce is simply named for the region from which it comes worcestershire where sure sounds just like this state name new hampshire so we drop the first r and the vowel in that syllable is the uh as in push vowel so the lips will start in a tight circle and then they'll relax a bit out but we still want a little bit of round for that vowel wha this is the stressed syllable then we have two unstressed syllables sure mr sure so they can be lower in pitch and quicker so we have the st consonant cluster wust so your teeth need to come together for the s sound tongue will go to the roof of the mouth for the t worster now the second two syllables have the schwa so we need basically no jaw drop for those worcestershire sure to make the s h sound between the two er sounds the tone will come forward a little bit but the tongue tip still doesn't need to be touching anything and your teeth will stay together shh and your lips will flare worcestershire so it's just three syllables worcestershire don't pronounce that first r and also make sure you put the schwa in the last syllable some people will want to say shire but just like the state new hampshire sure sure it's a schwa in that last syllable what words have you mispronounced or heard mispronounced put it in the comments okay earlier i promised you a link to the word schedule i actually had a series going for a while called word of the week where i made a video on how to pronounce a specific word that someone out there had requested all sorts of good words for non-native speakers i'm going to link to that playlist here be sure to subscribe and come check me out every tuesday where you'll get a new video on the english language i love teaching you english thank you for being here with me that's it and thanks so much for using rachel's english,TRUE
AcQcpgpGGH0,ENGLISH VOCABULARY |  Travel Vocabulary and Phrases! | Rachel‚Äôs English,"Do you love to travel?  Me too!  And when you‚Äôre traveling you want to know how to pronounce the necessary vocabulary and phrases, right?  I‚Äôve got everything you‚Äôll need, right here in one video.  You will come along with me as I travel to New York City!  Sounds fun, right?  I will show you how to use more than 20 travel-focused vocabulary words and phrases.  If you‚Äôre a frequent traveler in English-speaking countries, I‚Äôve made this video for you!  We‚Äôll learn English together, see New York City‚Ä¶and we‚Äôll have a lot of fun!  I think that learning English is easier when you‚Äôre having fun and learning from real-life conversations.  So that‚Äôs what I‚Äôve prepared for you!

Ever feel like you‚Äôre not able to speak confidently when you travel?  I‚Äôve been there too‚Äîit‚Äôs not a good feeling.  That‚Äôs why I have put together this list of English words and phrases to help you increase your confidence when you travel.  You‚Äôll learn how to pronounce tough vocabulary words like reservation, amenities, and incidentals.  I‚Äôll also show you how to use several travel phrases such as: head out and settle in.  When you learn context-specific phrases of verbs you‚Äôre learning English at a high level.  And that‚Äôs my complete focus in this video.

Maybe you‚Äôve had the experience of learning English by studying long lists of vocabulary words.  Or perhaps you‚Äôve become fluent in reading words in English, but not in actually saying them.  In both cases I think it‚Äôs important that you adjust the way you learn English.  We need to learn English words with their meanings if we hope to fully digest and incorporate them into our spoken English. 

In my experience it‚Äôs been critical to help students with the true pronunciation of American English.  That is to say, I want you to be able to sound exactly like a native speaker when you‚Äôre using English.  That‚Äôs quite different than being able to only read the language confidently, isn‚Äôt it?  Our fluency is limited in value if we don‚Äôt have the confidence we need to truly sound fluent.  And as you know, English is notorious for being difficult to speak.  But lucky for you, that‚Äôs where I come in!  

In this video we take a specific topic‚Äîtraveling‚Äîand use my own real-life travel to teach you the vocabulary and phrases you need to travel confidently in the US.  And because you‚Äôre learning with me as I go on a real trip, your learning will feel effortless and‚Ä¶even more important‚Ä¶fun!  Are you ready?  Me too!  Let‚Äôs get started with our travels and our learning.

together as you come with me for a weekend at the standard hotel in new york city you'll learn phrases and vocabulary that you might use at a hotel like amenities or incidentals we'll order room service together and enjoy some amazing views first let's check in hi um i booked online uh rachel smith and then about an hour after i booked i booked an upgrade i'm using the verb here to book i'm sure you're very familiar with the noun version of this word book but it's also a verb which means to reserve something i booked a hotel room you could also book a table at a restaurant this means you've made a reservation you could book a venue for your wedding or a concert venue could book an act or a band the bar around the corner booked my friend's band for friday here o-o makes the uh as in push vowel book uh book so both the noun book and the verb book are pronounced exactly the same hi um i booked online uh rachel smith and then about an hour after i booked i booked an upgrade i used the term upgrade this means to improve on something to get a higher quality for example if you've had your cell phone for a while and it's a bit slow you might want to get an upgrade here i'm using it as a noun on a flight you might be upgraded from an economy to a first class seat here i'm using it as a verb upgrade in this case i booked a hotel room and then the system asked me if i wanted to upgrade the offer seemed like a good deal to me so i did upgrade i paid a bit more money for a bigger better room and then about an hour after i booked i booked an upgrade because it was sounded very enticing what was being offered do you see how pregnant i am here i'm eight months pregnant and this was the last weekend that my doctor said i could travel away from home so we took stoney to my in-laws that is david's parents and took this short trip in the u.s you might hear people call this a baby moon that is a relaxing trip you take before it's harder to travel because you have a baby this is related to the term honeymoon which is a trip you take alone with your partner right after you get married you both for a water view deluxe cake yes south facing here we're using some terms that you might use when describing a room we booked a king which means it has a king-sized bed in it king and california king are the two largest sized beds she used the term water view this simply means what you can see from your room you might have city view park view water view ocean view garden view street view this hotel is close to the hudson river i used the term south facing this means when you're in your room looking out the window which direction are you looking i knew i wanted to be south facing because just north of the hotel are some taller buildings i didn't want to look directly at another building so i upgraded to a south-facing room you might also see a room described as a corner room which of course means you're on the corner of the building and you might get views in two different directions you both for a water view deluxe cake correct yes south facing yep i'll see that here if i could just see a form of id and a credit card for the restaurant sure when checking into a hotel there's a good chance that they'll ask for a form of id like she did that would be something official with your picture and name on it like a driver's license or passport id is short for identification they'll also usually want a credit card from you so they can make charges to the room if you damage or take anything yep here if i could just see a form of id and a credit card for the business sure so i see that initially you put a deposit down for the room so we would just need the cardboard stuff okay no problem incidentals this is a word they use for anything in addition to the cost of the room for example if you eat or drink from the mini bar in your room they'll keep track of that and charge it to your card after you leave so we would just need this card right now okay no problem and it doesn't it's not ready yet by chance is it it is oh perfect she asks have you stayed here before oh no i've not it's been on my bucket list bucket list have you heard this term before it means something you want to do within your lifetime for example visiting paris is on my bucket list oh no i've not it's been on my bucket list so i'm glad that it's happening yes right this initial here here and a signature there and if you could just add this gentleman's name right sure there might be something you have to initial or sign when checking into a hotel initial of course means you just put rs instead of your whole signature rachel smith this initial here here and a signature there and if you could just add this gentleman's name right sure we finished checking in and head up to our room room number 814 we have a card as a key very dark elevator see this is why i didn't want to be north facing it's because you're just looking at a building north facing south facing it can be very handy to know the details of the room you want when booking a hotel let's go find the room there's the river and there's the city [Applause] and there's the high line how cool is that the high line is a park in nyc that was built on top of an abandoned raised train line i'll also talk about the whitney which is an art museum that's the whitney right there have you ever been to the whitney david the new one yeah and that's their little rooftop spot there maybe we'll maybe we should go they have um pay as you wish entrance on friday evenings all right well let's settle in settle in is a phrase that means to unpack to get comfortable to arrange your things in a new place after a big move it can take some time to settle in whenever we stay somewhere even if it's just for a night or two i like to spend some time settling in when we first arrive to make this day more comfortable alright well let's settle in that night our friend renee dropped by and we ordered room service generally you can reach the front desk by pressing zero the front desk is there in the lobby where we checked in you can call them with your needs and questions room service is for the restaurant in the hotel that can make and bring food to your room good evening hi um is this where i called to place a room service order uh please hold on to them thank you it was the front desk not room service thank you for calling room service this is yuli how can i help you hi i'm in room 814 and i'd like to order two orders of fries and does that come with ketchup yeah okay and also two orders of a good pickle [Laughter] did you want anything to drink with that um anyone thirsty no i think we're good if you ask someone if they want something or offer them something and they say i'm good or we're good that's like saying no thank you that person does not want it anyone thirsty no i think we're good they told me it would be a 30 minute wait okay i am eight months pregnant if that helps boost me forward okay not a problem okay i'm just kidding thank you bye i mean i'm not kidding i am eight months pregnant if that makes a difference luckily the food came quickly wow that's a lot of fries that is a lot of fries i didn't expect them to be so little i think we could have gotten by with one order nope no no so glad we have two mini mayonnaise all the best to go with the mini ketchup mini ketchup and then two good pickles okay what did you think of yours i gave it an eight out of ten i think i'm gonna give it a six or seven oh so low do you do this too we rated how much we liked the pickle on a scale of one to ten one is always the lowest and ten the highest the very best of the best so i didn't love the pickle still there's something very luxurious about eating french fries in your hotel room at 10 30 at night many hotels have an ice machine this one was labeled an ice dispenser so almost every hotel room in america has an ice bucket that you can take to the machine to fill up this one also had tongs to serve ice into glasses david and i had such a relaxing stay here enjoying slow days before we leave let's go over a few more words and phrases that might be useful to you as you travel as you stay in hotels first when you check into hotel you'll find the front desk in the lobby and you can probably find a luggage cart there to help you get all your luggage to your room the opposite of checking in is checking out checkout of course is when you leave the hotel room and you give back your key two phrasal verbs for your travel vocabulary check in check out here i called the front desk to ask what time checkout was i also had to report an issue about the room good i guess everything this is ready hi freddie um i am wondering what time checkout is tomorrow morning it's at 12 pm okay perfect uh my other question is i'm in room 814 and the drain to the bathtub doesn't seem to close all the way okay i might apologize let me send someone off that is it okay that's great we're actually gonna head out in a minute is it okay if we're not here okay thank you so much i used the phrasal verb head out this means to leave we were just getting ready to leave our room for a walk head out that's great we're actually going to head out in a minute is it okay if we're not here okay thank you so much we don't even need to try to get a late check out because checkout's noon that's perfect this particular hotel does have a mini bar so that is a place where they're going to have some food and snacks for you they have some glasses for us nice and there's also a refrigerator mini bar usually refers to refrigerator refrigerator and this one is fully stocked that means it came with all sorts of goodies ready for us now usually if you eat or drink what comes here in the hotel it's quite expensive much more expensive than just running out and buying it yourself another neat thing that this particular hotel room has is a shower bath room so it's this whole room floor to ceiling doesn't matter if you get the whole thing wet a big bathtub and then there's some slats that look out into the room so you can still see the view as you take your shower this hotel room also has a safe many many hotel rooms do so you can put passports or money valuables whatever in the safe when you leave one thing that people are often interested in when choosing a hotel is the list of amenities amenities would be things like a gym or a pool or room service other things that you get in addition to your room or special things that you might get in your room many hotels come with a little card like this this one says privacy please and you hang this on your doorknob to let them know i don't want anyone to come in and work on my room or on the other side i do want someone to come in change out my towels for clean towels maybe vacuum so this card says privacy please but you might also see do not disturb thank you guys for traveling with me to new york city this weekend i also have a video that i made on travel phrases that you may use when checking in at an airport be sure to check that out are there other travel vocabulary or phrases videos

best ways for you to improve listening comprehension and learn tricks to sound more natural when speaking english like using specific reductions this january you're getting five all new ben franklin videos where we do a full analysis of real american english conversations today's topic reading headlines let's get started with this analysis first the whole conversation i feel like that's a lot of the conversations that i have with people is i'll be like oh i read about yeah but i didn't actually read the actual things i read the headline or i read the one sentence blurb that yeah facebook posts with the headline now the analysis in this little clip of conversation my friend laura and i are talking about how we're in this bad habit of not actually reading articles we'll just read headlines in the one second summary and then we'll talk about it oh i read about blah blah blah even though we didn't actually read the article are you guilty of that too i feel like that's a lot of the conversations that i have with people okay this is a really long thought group and i'm speaking pretty quickly but even though i am i am still making some words longer they're being brought out with a little bit more length but also a little bit more volume and they'll be a little higher in pitch they'll have ah this shape let's try to identify what they are i feel like that's a lot of the conversations that i have with people i feel like that's a lot of the conversations that i have with people i feel like that's a lot of the conversations that i have with people i feel like feel like that's a lot let's just start there i feel like that's a lot of the feel and lot are a little bit longer and they have the peak of the volume and of the pitch of the stress let's listen to that little sentence part that little sentence fragment again i feel like that's a lot of i feel like that's a lot of i feel like that's a lot of i feel like that's a lot of the i feel like that's a lot of the so even though we speak quickly in american english we still have longer syllables and that is really important for clarity with american english i've had some students who know that americans speak quickly and they want to do that too but it feels way too rushed and the reason why is because it doesn't have these longer words or syllables within the faster syllables we have to have the long ones too i feel like that's a lot of that okay let's listen to a little bit more and see what else do we hear as being a little bit longer a little bit more stressed i feel like that's a lot of the conversations that i have with people conversations that i have with people converse say so this syllable is a little bit more stressed a little bit longer conversations that i have with people have is more stressed here a little longer the conversations that i have with people the conversations that i have with people the conversations that i have with people is i'll be like oh i read about yeah conversations that i have with people these will be like oh i read about so those are for me the longest most clear syllables and a lot of the other syllables are said really quickly are there any reductions let's go back and see i feel like that's a lot of the conversations that i have with people i feel like that's a lot of the conversations that i have with people i feel like that's a lot of the conversations that i have with people let's look at the first sentence fragment um what's happening so i this is not a reduction but it's a link when we're putting two words together when one word ends with the same sound that the next word begins with we don't say feel like but we say feel like we connect them with a single l i feel like i feel like that's a lot of the i feel like i feel like i feel like that's a lot of the another thing so we have the the linked l here another thing i'm noticing is um how high the intonation is here i feel like i feel feel that's pretty high and i guess i was just doing that because it's sort of funny and so that brought more emotion and energy into the voice which made the pitch even higher okay so everything links together i feel like that k right into th sound ts cluster right into the schwa that's a that's uh that's a then we have a lot of the oh it's unclear to me the word of would be fully pronounced this way i definitely reduce it to the schwa i'm not quite sure if i drop the v or not it's said very quickly you can definitely drop the v here a lot of the a lot of the then you just use the schwa to link lot and the and the t here will become a flap t just one single flap against the roof of the mouth uh because it comes between two vowels and the little three word phrase a lot of is very common so practice at that with that way with me right now a lotta a lotta a lotta a lotta really smooth forward flow of sound it's a lot of it's a lot of it's a lot of the conversations that i have with people the conversations that i have with people okay so the schwa of the going right into the sea there's no break here the conversations that the word that i reduce that the vowel has the schwa conversations that that i have with people okay i'm doing something a little interesting here well first the z sound of conversations linking into the th conversations that conversations that no stop and sound so usually most people would would link this but i don't i don't link it with a flap t i sort of re-emphasize why do i do that don't know doesn't matter usually we'll link things with a flap t when the next word begins with a vowel we'll link that ending word we'll link that ending sound rather when a word ends in a vowel or diphthong plus t and then xr begins the vowel or diphthong just like up here with lot of we so often flap that t every once in a while we don't i'm emphasizing i by putting a little break i'm emphasizing that i have covered i have these conversations with the people that i have with people that i have with people that i have with people so even though i don't connect with the flap t it's still pretty smooth there's not a big break there that i have with people so i have have is more stress but i is also a little bit longer that i have with people that i have with people have with people have with people these sounds are all connected the v right into the w the th right into the p no break here people this word can be tough for for some people people can be tough for people okay so the pronunciation is p the e as in she vowel in the stressed syllable and then the dark l pull pull pull in the unstressed syllable a lot of people want to round their lips a little bit they substitute that in for the dark l try to make sure your lips are relaxed for this sound you want the back of the tongue to be doing the work for this sound people people people is i'll be like is i'll be like is i'll be like okay this is all pretty mumbled i s the word is has a z sound so that links into the next sound is i'll be like so the word i the words i will contract to i'll but it's hardly ever pronounced that way it's almost always reduced to something like all all which sounds like a-l-l said quickly all all is all is all is all i'll be like is i'll be like cuz i'll be like well i'll be like i'll be like i'll be like is i'll be like is i'll be like the word be said really quickly it's almost like there isn't a vowel there but like but like but like but like is that like so this is all lower in pitch a little flatter it comes across pretty unclear so we have sets of words like this strings of words like this in american english that are less clear certainly less fully pronounced and that provides contrast with the clearer stressed syllables like i have and that contrast is important in american english well as i'll be like oh i read about oh i read about so here i'm slowing down i'm speaking really clearly because i'm quoting myself i'm not just talking i'm saying something that i had said when we say i'll be like like is another way to say she said so all be like is all say or if you're talking about a woman and you could say and then she was like no way that would be the equivalent of saying and then she said no way so we use the word like sometimes in storytelling as a substitute for said i'll be like i'll say or i said and she was like is like saying and she said oh i read about okay so more clear longer words ending d links into beginning schwa of about everything is nice and connected i do a true tea here again i'm speaking more clearly i'm not just talking i'm quoting myself so i have to make it seem different and that's why it's all a little bit more clear than just normal conversation well as i'll be like oh i read about is i'll be like oh i read about is i'll be like oh i read about yeah but i didn't actually read the actual thing but i didn't actually read i put a little break here separating thought groups but i didn't actually read the actual thing i do that for emphasis it's funny i'm talking about reading something but i didn't read it i just read one sentence about it but i didn't actually read read much longer the most stressed word there but i didn't actually read but i but i but i this is like i was saying before usually when a word ends in a t and the sound before is a vowel or defong and the next word begins the vowel or diphthong we flap that to make a smooth connection but i but i but i but i but i but i but i didn't actually didn't actually it sounds to me like i'm stop i'm dropping the t there's no sense of a stop here didn't actually so the ending n is linking into the next vowel na na actually i didn't actually i didn't actually i didn't actually actually actually so this word can be four syllables actually or it can be three actually i think three symbols is a little bit more common it's a little easier that's what i've done actually in ipa i would write it like this stress on the first syllable ack and then i would probably write that with the schwa actual e actually actually the ending e links right into the next sounds of the consonant r actually read actually read so everything is smoothly connected didn't actually read and actually read and actually read the actual thing the actual thing the actual thing so i'm stressing this quite a bit i've slowed down the actual thing those two syllables have some stress the word v pronounced with the e vowel we typically do that when the next word begins with a vowel or diphthong otherwise we pronounce it as the schwa the but here it's the the actual the actual and it links right into the next word the actual thing the actual thing the actual thing the actual thing is and as i'm saying that laura says the actual about i can't quite tell because i'm speaking at the same time but i think she might be doing a schwa the actual that's pretty normal too i mean the rule is if the next word begins the vowel or diphthong you pronounce this e as the e vowel but i've noticed americans certainly don't always do this the actual about actual about linking those two words together about about the actual about and then she puts a stop t at the end she does not release that i read the headline i read the headline okay what are the two most stressed syllables there i read the headline so the words that are usually the ones that are stressed in a sentence are the nouns verbs adjectives and adverbs and they don't always have equal stress but those are the words that are content words that are usually the ones that are these longer more clear words so everything in this forward thought group is linked together said very smoothly always a forward motion of the voice not choppy at all i read the headline i read the headline the word the pronounced with the schwa the next sound is a consonant we do pronounce the h in this word i read the headline i read the headline i read the headline or i read the one sentence blurb or i read the one sentence i put a little break here while i'm thinking of what word to say the word or this often reduces to er er er or i read or i read i don't reduce it here or or i read the or so the word or is the ah as unlaw sound followed by r when it's not reduced but the ah sound really changes here it's not ah it becomes much more closed the lips round further the tongue pulls further back in the mouth or i read the one sentence or i read the one sentence or i read the one sentence red and one get the most stress there everything is linked together let me spell out the word one here this letter is a vowel but the word the sounds are this in ipa these are the sounds so whenever we're talking about rules like with flap t's or this kind of thing or the pronunciation of the word the we're never talking about letters we're always talking about sounds so the beginning sound of this word is a consonant that means the rule is this would be pronounced with a schwa not an e vowel the one the one not the one the one the the the one the one sentence the one the one the one sentence one sentence let's talk about this word for a second sentence what's happening with fat t sen i'm making it a stop t the rule is when the t is in a sequence of t schwa n that it's a stop t and that's what i'm doing here scent stop the air really quickly just hold it for a second sentence sentence other words like this mountain kit fountain curt i have a video where i go over this a little bit more in detail you can search on youtube rachel's english mountain and it should come up sentence one sentence one sentence one sentence one sentence blurb that so now i say blurb that and that's one thought group i'm thinking of exactly what to say blurb that blurb that so i might normally reduce the word that to the schwa but i don't hear because i'm thinking about what to say so i'm speaking a little bit more slowly blurb that so that keeps its full a vowel it does have a stop t blurb that blur that so here we have an r a b a t h three consonants in a row blur that i don't release the b b is a stop consonant just like t the lips come together that stops the air and then they release but we often don't release stop consonants in conversation especially when the next sound is another consonant so my lips come together i make the b sound blur [Music] but then rather than releasing i go right into the th sound blur that blurb that blurb that blurb that blurb that blurb that blurb that yeah that yeah laura says yeah up down shape of stress she knows what i'm gonna say she agrees with me she probably does it too yeah yeah yeah facebook posts with the headline facebook posts with the headline facebook posts with the [Music] headline so more stress on face and head posts this is a verb and i said that nouns verbs adjectives and adverbs are the words that are usually stressed but not all of them will be stressed every time facebook posts with the headline that would be too much so even content words are sometimes not stressed compared to the stressed words in a sentence facebook posts with a headline so here we have sts i do make all of those sounds posts posts posts posts posts posts with the headline facebook posts with the headline with the headline so i said before when we have the same sound at the beginning and ending of one of a word that links together two words that link together that we make one sound so with is usually pronounced with an unvoiced th the is usually pronounced with the voiced th when these two words come together which happens pretty frequently the unvoiced sound wins it's stronger with the with the with the headline with the headline with the with the with the so it's like taking the word with and just putting a schwa at the end with a with a with a headline facebook posts with the headline it's with the headline it's with the headline it's with the headline the d sound in head line d just like t just like b is a stop consonant here it's followed by another consonant and when stop consonants are followed by consonants they're very often not released so it's not headline head head we don't release the tongue headline we say head line so we put our tongue up into position for the d we make a quick d sound but rather than releasing we go right into the l sound headline headline headline headline headline headline headline let's listen to the whole conversation one more time i feel like that's a lot of the conversations that i have with people is i'll be like oh i read about yeah but i didn't actually read the actual things i read the headline or i read the one sentence blurb that yeah facebook posts with the headline that analysis is really fun and helpful right click here to see

months of the year January January starts with the J as in jar consonant sound where you are making sound with the vocal cords J as it is voiced the lips you can see take a position where the corners come in but the lips stretch away from the face which shows the teeth J the next sound is the a as in bat followed by the N consonant sound when the a as in bat is followed by the N the M or the NG consonant sound it is somewhat affected by that consonant a uh n so it is this uh that is thrown in that does not appear in the IPA transcription but that happens as you pass from the a into the and consonant sound a Jan Jan January the next syllable is the U as in Fu dong Janu Janu and finally the open e as in bed Janu the r consonant sound and the e as in she [Music] a so the corners of the lips pull wider for the e as and she after having been in the circle for the r January January it's the first syllable here that is stressed January January February begins with the F consonant sound F so the bottom lip moves up to touch the bottom of the top teeth and it's unvoiced so you just let air pass through Fe it opens into the e as in bed vowel sound Feb and then has the B sound where the lips come together to make that b sound the second syllable can be pronounced one of two ways you can pronounce the r and then have the U as a mu vowel Ru feu although I don't feel like I hear this very much in America I know it is an accepted pronunciation but I think much more you will hear U the U as in Fu D thong rather than an R sound so in most cases this first R sound is left out febu febu and then the end just like January the e as in bed the r consonant sound and the e as in she February February again it is the first syllable Fe that is accented February February March March begins with the m consonant sound and then has the a as in Father followed by the r consonant sound when the a as in father is followed by the r consonant sound the r has a way of taking over the vowel so it's not a as we think of it this very relaxed a drop of the jaw relaxed lips relaxed forward tongue but rather Mar the lips begin to already sort of form this slightly circular position for the r and the tongue begins to already draw back into that position R mar mar it is followed by the CH as in Char consonant sound which is just like the J in January but it's not voiced so you just pass air through your vocal cords March April April begins with the a as in say defang and this is the accented syllable a April it then has the P consonant sound followed by the r Pur per the schah and the dark l o o April April May May begins with the m consonant sound and is followed by the a as in sayong which is also the first syllable of April May May May June like January begins with the J as in jar sound it then has the U ASM Buu vowel and the N consonant sound June June July like June and January begins with a J consonant sound the first syllable can be pronounced one of two ways it can either have the U as in Buu July or it can have awah J July July July so with the O as U the lips would be more rounded and with the schwa more relaxed at any rate it's the second syllable that is accented JJ July July and the second syllable has the L Sound followed by the I as in by dong July August in August it is the first syllable that is accented a August and it is the a as in law vowel sound the second syllable begins with a G consonant sound G which is voiced so you do make sound with your vocal cords G and the tongue reaches up to the soft pallet and pulls away it then has the uh as in butter very relaxed vowel sound a a and finally the s and t come consonant sounds St August September here it is the middle syllable that is stressed September September both the first and second syllables have the e as in bed vowel sound but the second one because it's in the accented syllable will be a little longer and a little higher in Pitch septe September so it begins with the S consonant sound unvoiced s has the a as in bed s the P consonant sound se but here you don't release P because you do that in the T SE septe the e as in bed and the M consonant sound septmber the B consonant sound schah and R consonant sound B September October November and December are all similar to September and that it is the middle syllable the distressed and they all end with the same syllable bur so October begins with the a as in Father sound followed by the k sound C which is unvoiced where the tongue pulls away from the soft pallet o o the accented syllable is the t consonant sound followed by the O as in no diong octo October October November November begins with the N consonant sound and has the O as in no D thong here in an unaccented syllable no no the the V consonant sound followed by the e as in bed and the M consonant sound no them nov November December it begins with the D consonant sound followed by the as in sit vowel sound d d it then has the S consonant sound and the e as in bed followed by the M consonant sound de December December and now a sentence for each month listen and repeat I'll see you in January in February it snows a lot in March it seems like it's always raining last April we went to Europe my birthday is May 5th in June summer begins in July we celebrate the birthday of America in August it's always so hot in September We Begin our school year October is the beginning of fall November is my favorite month in December we have Christmas,TRUE
