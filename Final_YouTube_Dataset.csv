"GQh8J0EgPPM","Migrant sex offender mistakenly released from prison arrested in London | BBC News","Migrant sex offender Hadush Kebatu has been arrested in the Finsbury Park area of London after a two-day manhunt.
 
Kebatu had been mistakenly released on Friday from HMP Chelmsford, where he was serving a 12-month sentence for sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl and a woman in Epping, Essex.
 
UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer says Kebatu ""will be deported"" and Justice Secretary David Lammy has ordered a full investigation into Friday's release.
 
London's Met Police Commander James Conway says ""information from the public"" helped officers locate Kebatu earlier this morning.

Hadush Kabatu was arrested in the Finsbury Park area of North London this morning. The Metropolitan Police Commander James Conway who oversaw the operation to find him said information from the public led officers to Finsbury Park and following a search they located Mr. Kabatu. He was detained by police but will be returned to the custody of the prison service. Kabatu was jailed last month for sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl and a woman in Eping, east of London. He was let go in error on Friday while being transported to a deportation center. Nick Johnson has this report. Newly released CCTV shows Hadush Kabatu in Dston Library in the Hackne area of East London at about 6:00 on Friday evening. He's carrying a bag decorated with pictures of avocados. Earlier that day, Kabatu was mistakenly released from prison in Essex and was later filmed by a member of the public on Chelmsford High Street wearing what appears to be a prison issue tracksuit and carrying a plastic bag for his belongings. From Chelmsford, he caught the 1241 train towards London. Police say he then got off at Stratford in the east of the capital at around 10 1. I'm arresting on suspicion of sexual assault on a female under 16 years old. So, you didn't have to say anything. Kabatu is an asylum seeker from Ethiopia and arrived in the UK on a small boat. He was jailed last month for sexually assaulting a 14year-old girl and a woman in Eping. He'd been staying at the nearby Bell Hotel and his arrest in July led to a series of protests which spread to other asylum hotels around the country. It's not yet clear exactly what led to Kibatu's release, but sources have told the BBC that prison staff led him away from the facility toward the railway station. Last year, 262 prisoners in England and Wales were released when they should not have been. Former prison governors say it's the manifestation of a broken system. Lots of prisoners are held in effective solitary confinement. There's no education, no training. Uh the probation service is failing by every measure. So yeah, there are operational failures, but they have been around for a long period of time. You know, this is one symptom of it. Um and we're going to have to get used to it. Kibbati was due to have been transferred to an immigration detention center, and the justice secretary, David Lami, has ordered an independent investigation. Additional checks prior to prisoner's release are also due to come into effect on Monday. Nick Johnson, BBC News. With me is our correspondent, Graeme Satchel. Graeme, just bring us right up to date with how this arrest happened and what the police are saying. Well, Kabatu was released on Friday uh London time and he was arrested they say this morning at 8 uh local time in an area of London, the Finsbury Park area of London. It's not completely clear whether he was actually in the park. Uh but the police are saying that this was a fast-paced investigation and they were specifically helped by members of the public, tipped off by members of the public. They say he was detained by police and now will be returned to the custody of the prison service. So this bit of this story I suppose has come to an end. This man has been at large released by mistake on Friday at large for you know pretty much two days two nights certainly been very cold in London. Um and uh now the police have found him and they say that he'll be returned to the custody of the prison service. Graeme, just remind us, put this back in context for us if people have sort of tuned out of the news a little bit for the last couple of days and just remind us of the kind of huge deal that this has become. So Kabatu became, I suppose, a nexus for anti-migrant sentiment in this country. He arrived in a small boat from Ethiopia. The day after he he arrived, he's alleged to have sexually assaulted a teenage girl. He was arrested, charged and convicted, sent to prison for 12 months. Uh and immediately after he was arrested, a series of very large protests started at the asylum hotel where he was staying in Essex that spread across the whole country. So, as I say, he became a focal point for anti-migrant sentiment in this country. He had said um at his trial, I was actually at the sentencing of him uh in Chsford Crown Court and his lawyer said then that he wanted to be deported. So for him to have finished his sentence and then to be mistakenly released, it's a sort of calamitous catalog of errors almost verging on fast really. Um, so there's been a lot of criticism, as you can imagine, of the way the the whole way this is handled. Right from the number of people arriving in this country in small boats to the way they're housed in asylum hotels uh to the uh wrong release of this man who became so highprofile, so uh controversial uh and the government today saying that they welcome uh this arrest. They've congratulated the police on their work. They're saying there will be an independent inquiry now to see exactly how he was mistakenly released. On that, Graeme, and I I appreciate that we can't speculate, but um is there any indication about even which department will have been responsible for the release? Would it could have been police officers? Could it have been custody officers, prison staff? What what do we know about that? I mean, the the finger of blame, I suppose, in this specific instance is pointing directly at the prison service. So he was in prison in Chelmsford prison. He was meant to be transferred to a detention center to be deported and instead of being transferred he was released. So there was a mistake at Chelmsford prison. So that is where the inquiry will look at first. But the truth of it is that this is a much bigger story. So if you talk to former prison governors, for example, people who work in prisons, they say they're dealing with thousands of prisoner transfers every day. that mistakes are happening all the time because the service is underfunded and overstretched. There were something like 260 uh prisoners wrongfully released from prisons in England and Wales last year. So they say this is further evidence that the system is broken and we now understand that as you were saying he will be sent to a deportation center to be deported back to Ethiopia. I think so. I mean that that certainly was his uh desire. Um, I mean, the police are saying today just in the last half an hour that he has been detained and will be returned to the custody of the prison service. I don't want to put words into the mouth of the prison service, but I think that the last place that he's pretty much the last person that they would want to see ever again. So, I imagine that he will be transferred to a detention center as quickly as possible and then deported. Graeme, thanks very much indeed for the latest there. Let us bring in our senior UK correspondent, Sema Cetcha, who is on the line. Sema, good to talk to you. uh Graeme there talking about how uh Kabatu has become symbolic of so something so much more and of course the whole affair has been so politicized. Uh just take us through what you believe will be the sort of could be the wider political fallout here. Yes. I mean this is the news the government, the police and the prison service were desperately hoping for. It's incredibly significant that a member of the public has provided the police with a tick off which shows that the Metropolitan Police's public appeal paid off. In terms of the political fallout, well, this puts the deputy prime minister David Lami under extreme pressure. He's only been imposed for 6 weeks or so, and this isn't exactly a great start. Even though it's not really his fault, there's something systemic that's gone wrong at that prison. People are asking whether he is the right man for the job. We know that prisons are in a state of crisis. They're overcrowded. A recent report said that they were 98% back at capacity. They're overstretched. There isn't enough staff. I hear from staff all the time. Prison officers are telling me they're struggling to do their job. They're struggling to cope with the number of inmates. Even though thousands have been released early in recent months, they're saying it's still incredibly tight inside those walls at the moment. And I think this conveys a fact that, you know, the government is perhaps not in control of this situation. That's what I'm hearing from critics. They're saying that if it was, something like this wouldn't have happened. But it's also worth saying that more than 260 people were released in error over the last year. This is the only one this year that we know about because of the high-profile nature of the man that was released by accident. But this does happen all the time. But those figures over the last 3 years have risen dramatically. They've gone from something like 81 about 3 years ago to more than 260 now. So I think there's going to be some massive questions here for the government, for the prison service. What can they do to stop this from happening again? Yeah. Um let me just bring you actually a line that has come through from the uh MP for Chelmsford uh which is of course where the prison is based. Uh it is a Liberal Democrat MP uh Marie Goldman who says I'm relieved that Hades Hadkatu has been found is back in custody. He must now he must now be deported but this does not excuse the serious mistakes that let this happen in the first place. It's unacceptable the safety of my constituents and the people of London was ever put at risk. And she says the prison service had several chances to fix it and failed. The government has serious questions to answer and major work to do to make the system fit for purpose. It certainly isn't at the moment. And she ends a rapid national inquiry must happen to get to the bottom of this. Sema, uh, with with all the political anger that this has provoked, uh, is it inevitable that there will be a a head or several heads that will roll? I think there were there's lots of people asking that question whether somebody is going to need to go. As I said, the deputy prime minister's only been imposed for 6 weeks or so. He took over from Shabbana Mammud, who is now the home secretary. She's been credited with bringing the prison system under control. That's what her fans at least say. But some people are now asking, did she do as good of a job as many have thought? We know that David Lammy uh has now ordered an independent inquiry. At least he's ordered officials to draw up the terms of an independent investigation into this error and identify candidates to do it. But yes, of course, there are going to be some major questions. I mean this is a story that many people out there have been thinking how has this happened? I found out yesterday that prison staff led Kabatu away from the prison and directed him towards the train station and he was very confused apparently. He didn't know what he was doing, where he was going. He was asking multiple questions but he was told to go in a certain direction and get away from the prison premises. Now, this is normal conduct when somebody is released, but he wasn't actually supposed to be released. So, as I said, there are lots of people asking, how can something like this happen? He was in a category B prison. This is a remand prison, a reception prison. So, where some people are kept before trial. Um, so lots of people are let out all the time to go to court visits. Uh, so they can give evidence. I mean, sorry, so they can make an appearance in court, should I say. So, this is happening regularly. um every day multiple questions as to how this could happen and how staff were then showing him out and showing him towards the train station. Yeah, I mean it is extraordinary actually Sema. Um I'm just reading here a little uh bit of copy from the press association um which says a delivery driver described seeing Kabuk Kabatu return to the Charmsford prison in a very confused state four or five times only to be turned away by prison staff and directed to the railway station. The driver named only a Sim told our colleagues at Sky News that he saw Kibatu come out of the prison saying where am I going? What am I doing? Uh so it does seem like an extraordinary extraordinary blunder. Um and uh uh thank you Sema for taking us through some of the um big questions that are going to be asked now uh as uh the uh fallout continues. That's Sema Contetcher, our senior UK correspondent. Sema, I'll let you go because I know you've got other parts of our output to to feed. Um the health secretary Wes Streeting uh told us how the arrest unfolded. uh this morning uh we finally managed to track him down. He's been arrested and I want to say an enormous thank you to the public u whose vigilance enabled this arrest this morning. Uh he's been detained and will be deported. What we will also do is ascertain how on earth it was that he was ever released into the public uh in the first place when he should have been deported. The justice secretary has ordered an investigation that will take place. There will be accountability and we will be open and honest with the public about what went wrong, who is being held to account and what we plan to do about it to stop this happening again. What were the circumstances of the arrest? How come it took so many days? There's been an enormous police manhunt. This is a big city uh where it's actually fairly easy to be anonymous. Police have been scouring CCTV uh and have been keeping uh their eyes open. But it's thanks to the vigilance of the public that we got the vital intelligence needed to track him down to Finsbury Park this morning where an arrest was made. I want to thank the Metropolitan Police and Essex Police and most importantly of all thank the public whose vigilance have enabled this arrest. We will now investigate the circumstances of his release. It is completely unacceptable uh to put it mildly that he was ever released onto the streets. We will get to the bottom of how this happened. There will be accountability uh and we will take steps to make sure this does not happen again. This was a shambles, wasn't it? Who who will resign? It absolutely beggars belief that this man was ever released onto the streets when he should have been deported. Uh thanks to the vigilance of the public and the hard work of the Met and Essex police, he has been arrested, detained, and will be deported. But we will also investigate the circumstances of his release. Make sure that we get to the bottom of how on earth this could have happened and make sure that there is accountability and transparency to the public who are rightly concerned about how this could have ever happened in the first case."
"tKE2Hh_95pU","Suspects arrested over theft of jewels at Louvre museum in Paris | BBC News","Two suspects have been arrested over the theft of precious crown jewels from Paris's Louvre museum, French media say.

The Paris prosecutor's office said one of the men had been taken into custody as he was preparing to take a flight from Charles de Gaulle Airport.

Items worth €88m (£76m; $102m) were taken from the world's most-visited museum last Sunday, when four thieves wielding power tools broke into the building in broad daylight.
 
The Paris prosecutor's office said in a statement that the arrests had been made on Saturday evening, without specifying how many people had been taken into custody.

The Paris prosecutor's office says that the men were originally from the Parisian suburb of Senuni and one was preparing to board a flight from Sha de Gaul airport. That is the largest airport in Paris. Items of inestimable value were taken from the world's most visited museum last Sunday when four thieves wielding power tools broke into the building in broad daylight. France's justice minister has since conceded that security protocols failed, leaving the country with a terrible image. Let us speak now to Chris Marinelo who is the uh chief executive and founder of Art Recovery International, an organization that specializes in locating and recovering stolen and looted works of art. Chris Marin Marinelo, thanks so much uh for talking to us here. It's busy uh morning, so sorry to keep you waiting. Uh first of all, your reaction to uh to the arrest initially of these of these two men. Well, this is really encouraging news. Uh you cannot find these jewels without first finding the perpetrators. And that's what you know we the the prosecutor believes they have two of the four men that were actually involved. and Chris uh the we we understand that um of the jewels that were seized the crown one of the crowns or or the most perhaps even the most valuable one um fell uh outside uh they dropped it and and and will have broken uh in in some parts. Do you think that there is a real uh expectation that the French authorities may be able to recover the rest of the jewels or is it perhaps more likely that they have already been broken up and perhaps sold on? Well, now is the time where the French police need to interrogate the people that they've arrested. And I'm not talking about politely asking, ""Please, please, please tell us where the jewels are."" I'm talking about some uh Clint Eastwood Dirty Harry style interrogation. And some deal making is going on right now to be able to convince these two individuals to give up their their compatriots and uh tell them where the jewels are. That's what's happening right now. Just remind us uh Chris of uh just how priceless these jewels are and what we were talking about in this extraordinary robbery. Well, to the French state and to the French people, these are part of their cultural heritage and are actually considered priceless. If you have to put a monetary figure on, we're we're looking at about a hundred million euros worth of diamonds, sapphires, uh and rare gems. Yeah. an extraordinary loss for the Louv Museum if indeed they are lost. And typically Chris in these kinds of uh very organized robberies that we saw with the truck with the with a ladder of course I mean uh power tool power tools used to open the the window. I mean this looks like a a very very planned operation by by serious professionals. Well it does seem that way but the fact that they actually got on a plane and were stopped at an airport shows me that they're a little more amateurish than we thought. Not exactly Oceans 11, more like the Pink Panther and and and Inspector Cluso. Typically, uh yeah, we'll see. We'll see who who they who they identify with more, but um typically would there be um is there sort of international organized crime rings in in in in these kinds of instances or are they often homegrown? No. No. We're seeing Europe being plagued right now, including the UK, by international gangs, mostly out of Eastern Europe or or Northern Africa that are picking apart uh our cultural heritage piece by piece because gold is such at a at a high level and and and there are jewels and diamonds that are are relatively unprotected. Um would there be uh would there be any chance really of them being able to sell on the jewels uh given the high-profile nature of this robbery or uh is there I mean there's going to be so much scrutiny of course of any kind of jewel trading of anything that would be suspected to be part of of of the of the object seized. I mean what is the sort of likelihood that they would be able to make a proper a a a real financial profit from this? Well, there's really no chance that they would have been able to sell these over the last week intact given the amount of press coverage, but broken up, uh, they would have been able to, uh, sell the diamonds, uh, recut the, uh, the sapphires and move them on I if they had a plan in place. And most organized criminals like these do have a plan to get rid of the things that they stole. It's just a matter of whether the police caught these two gentlemen in time. Yeah. Okay. Chris Marinelo, uh, CEO and founder of Art Recovery International. Very good to talk to you. Thank you very much indeed. will continue to uh watch that story and developments from Paris."

I didn't see you last week. You were away. I was away and you're away. We were both away. Lucky us. But lucky listener, lucky newscaster. They got better people. I'm I'm sure they did. So sorry if you're back, but here we are. Here we go. Mind you, you're on form with a scoop. Yes, I'll be talking to Camela Harris. Fab. I know. That was very exciting because well it's not that common that you you know get to have a just casually have a conversation with someone who came quite close to becoming the president of the United States of America. So yes it was really intriguing to speak to her. Really really interesting and it's a busy news weekend as well. It is with some you couldn't possibly make it up stories which there have been plenty of already this week but I think we have hit peak 2025 and peak phase two for Kier Sarmmer's government who seemed to have managed to lose a sex offender who ought not to have been allowed to walk off down the house street who instead was meant to be being deported. So we're very serious but also a really kind of what story that the government is struggling to handle at the moment just as they have picked the non inhouse deputy leadership candidate. Yes. Described to me is another example of Karma's reverse Midas touch. Uh Lucy Powell has become the deputy leader of the Labour party. So the woman who Kier Starmer deemed wasn't good enough to be in the cabinet a few short weeks ago is now his number two. That's not awkward, is it? Well, I think the newscast finished for today. Thank goodness for that. Chris Mason will be coming in on Saturday's newscast. Hello, it's Laura in the studio. It's Patty in the studio. Hello. And as you said, Chris will be here shortly. And so, if he walks in during our conversation, he's not being rude. He's just a man doing the news. So, a man in a So, let's get to the scoop with the US presidential candidate, as was Carla Harris. and intriguingly somebody who quite clearly from my take wants to be again a presidential candidate really I very much think so you and I have both interviewed lots of politicians over the years and they're sometimes a bit koi aren't they when you ask them a big question something like are you going to try and become the president again after you lost very in a very bruising way to Donald Trump last year and she's done a few interviews in America of late because she has a book out called 107 days about guess what her campaign. And in those interviews, which we watched kind of carefully before we sat down with her this week, when she was asked about her future, she would say things like, ""Oh, well, I'm not focusing on that right now."" ""Oh, maybe, maybe not. No, I'm just not thinking about that at the moment. I'm just, you know, listening to people and taking some time out and concentrating on my book."" And all those kinds of things. She went quite a bit further than that in our conversation. Um and she said, ""Well, should we listen instead?"" In terms then of what is next for you, you write very powerfully about the differences that many women have made to your life, whether that was your meeting with Angela Merkel or the experience of growing up with your extraordinary mother or the stories of your baby nieces, um Amara and Leela. Um when are they going to see a woman in charge in the White House? In their lifetime for sure. Could it be you? Possibly. Have you made a decision yet? No, I have not. But you say in your book, I'm not done. That is correct. I am not done. I I I have lived my entire career a life of service and it's in my bones and there are many ways to serve. I've not decided yet what I will do in the future beyond what I am doing right now. But you've been very clear that it's a possibility you might run again to become president. And in my experience interviewing politicians, when someone says, ""I'm not done,"" it means they are thinking seriously about running. But when you look at the bookies odds, uh, they put you as an outsider, even behind Dwayne the Rock Johnson. I mean, is that underestimating you? I think there are all kinds of polls that will tell you a variety of things. I've never listened to polls. If I listen to polls, I would have not run for my first office or my second office, and I certainly wouldn't be sitting here in this interview. Bit of steel at the end there. So, Patty, if I were doing a political pub quiz and I were to ask you, a politician says, ""I'm not done. It's in my bones, but I haven't made a decision yet."" What do you think they're trying to tell us? She a runner? Well, that was very much the impression that I got. Wow. You can tell she hasn't made a final decision, right? In America, partly it's also about the Benjamin's baby, isn't it? You know, she was a well criticized candidate. She didn't manage to beat Trump. Big contrast to Hillary Clinton. Made it plain. That was bust. Absolutely. And that is not where she is at all. She clearly believes that she still has a lot to offer. She clearly is still full of ambition despite what was a very bruising defeat. And we talk elsewhere in the interview about what she thinks went wrong. Uh what her vision or the Democrat's vision for America next time round ought to be. And of course, I also asked her about the controversy about Joe Biden's health, but you have to wait till tomorrow to hear what she said about that. Fair enough. But it's plain one of the reasons that she is thinking about running, which I think is obvious that she is. Not just because she's got ambition left in her and it's in her bones, but because she is horrified by what she sees happening in Trump's America and she's clearly deeply unhappy about what she's going on. And this is our take. In the campaign, you said Donald Trump was a fascist. Do you think he's running a fascist authoritarian government? I was asked if he was a fascist and I said yes. And the reason is that I look at what is happening right now. And again, it is what I predicted. He said he would weaponize the Department of Justice. He has done exactly that. He has used the United States Department of Justice which should be an independent agency that makes decisions based on fact and law and not personal vengeance of the president of the United States. You look at what has happened in terms of how he has weaponized for example the federal agencies around going after political satirists who he didn't his skin is so thin he couldn't endure criticism from a a joke and attempted to shut down an entire media organization in the process. And you are critical of billionaires and other institutions bowing down capitulation. There are there are there are not all but there are many that have capitulated since day one who are bending the knee at the foot of a tyrant I believe for many reasons including they want to be next to power because they want to perhaps have a merger approved or avoid an investigation. And it is a crying shame that when push comes to shove, we can't count on the titans of industry to at least posture in a way that is about maintaining the guard rails around a democracy and democratic system. I mean, if we all wind ourselves out a bit, of course, she and Donald Trump were bitter political rivals. It is extraordinary that we have in 2025 arrived in a situation where somebody who was the second most powerful person in America for several years feels comfortable even perhaps feels a duty to say in their view that they think the leader of the free world is a fascist and an authoritarian and a tyrant. Yeah, that is an extraordinary place to be. It is very much a commentary on where we've reached with trying to cover the United States which is now a very polarized place. She's missing certain bits from the account. Number one, the American people knew who they were voting for. They were voting for the same man, Donald Trump, who had called the previous election who had wrongly called the previous election stolen. When the American people voted for Donald Trump, they were voting for that man. Partly because the Democrats ran such a hapless campaign, say Democrats, and ran a candidate who should not have been run, say Democrats. I've spoken to several of them, including um the governor of California, Gavin Newsome. There's no love lost between him and Camela Harris, rival Californian politician. But let's just say that's also true. The Democrats were seen by Democrats to have completely failed to run a sensible election for the White House. That happened as well. Indeed, it happened as well. And when you ask therefore the White House for their opinion on what Camela Harris has said to us in the last couple of days, it's very interesting because the White House quite often chooses not to respond to whatever story is flying around. But they did choose to respond to Camela Harris. They said Camela Harris lost the election in a landslide. She should have taken the hint. The American people don't care about her absurd lies. Or maybe she did take the hint and that's why she's airing her grievances to foreign publications. That's you. That's Well, that's us. That's the BBC. Um, and you're right. America's in this place where you have people on two different sides of the political debate who are implacably opposed to each other in a way that is incredibly deep. And our brothers and sisters at America has obviously talk about this with more knowledge and more insight than than we do, but you know, it's our turn at the moment. Um and they've just got to this position. What Camel Harris is also, which won't surprise you, she's eager to emphasize is that the popular vote was really very close. There was less than 2% in it. But that's like a coalition in this country complaining about the first pass the post system. It's not how you win in America. You win by winning the electoral college where each state has a certain number of voters. And Donald Trump trounced her in the electoral college. He got more than 300 votes. But you can tell she has a certain I think you can hear it in her voice. You know, she was a a criticized candidate for all sorts of reason. The Democrats don't really seem to have done much productive soulsearching yet about what really went wrong or where they should go next. But I think you can hear in her voice, there's still fire there. She's not ready to pack up and and disappear. There's many questions to the Democrats. They're accused of fighting the last campaign. She's trying to refresh it by saying the things that he's done smack of fascism or are fascist. So he's she's trying to reinvent her criticism of him and there will be newscasters who probably agree with her. But I just wonder since we can't do the whole interview, what's the behind the scenes like of doing a big set piece with a US politician of this caliber? Any anything kind of groovy going on in the background? It's like a military operation. incredibly controlled, incredibly carefully choreographed, incredibly tense with aids standing around looking at their watches. Oh, we'll be here in 2 minutes. Oh, she'll be here in one minute. Oh, which chair is it going to be? Oh, no, she prepares to be in that chair. This, you know, incredibly controlled. And also there's just something I think lots of newscasters maybe feel this too, but British journalists often we're all a bit like stareyed about American polit politics because it's just bigger and glossier and doesn't mean it's better, but it's different. And I suppose it's more showbiz, right? It's more showbiz. There are not, you know, UK politicians don't have their own glam squads. I'll just put it that way, you know. And it's a it's a different it's a very very very different environment. And also we've tried to import some of the stuff from America, haven't we? The spin room, the feed of the convention. And I went to the convention in Madison Square Garden where they appointed the Democrats. Oh, Chris has arrived. Hello. Plum squad where they nominated Bill Clinton. And you know, we have ours in old hotel ballrooms. This was Madison Square Garden, guys. And the letters like Theresa May's letters did not fall off the back of the stage. So, and the balloons work and it's not just a load of empty seats. So, you know, it's quite the American politics rightly is seen as showbiz and thus superficial and everything else, but there's a difference, says Laura K. There is a difference. It's bigger and it's glossier and there's absolutely loads and loads and loads and loads and loads and loads of money involved. And Harris actually one of the things she did do successfully in her campaign which was criticized for all sorts of other reasons is she raised enormous amounts of moola very very very very fast and you know she had like Beyonce and Oprah and I remember David Cameron once had Gary Barlo but doesn't quite match up really does it? Hello Chris. Hello you work today do they in the United States? Incredible. No I'm very well thank you. Yeah good. Nice to be part of the weekend newscasting gang. Anything going on? Well, enough to keep us keep me busy. Yeah. You know, it's been uh I've had a morning of It's always glamorous, isn't it? Reporting. Standing in the street. Yeah. In South London. My own personal old favorite. Exactly. Yeah. It's a It's a wholesome reporting pursuit. It's as close as we got to the actual declaration of the Labour leadership contest. Anyone would think the party didn't want to make a great fuss of it because it wasn't their woman. It wasn't It wasn't Downey Street's woman. Well, that's true. But also it was a contest they could have just done without you know coming about as a result of circumstance as a result of Angela Raina having to resign back in that first week of September triggering a vacancy that they'd have rather not had and then running a contest which inevitably because it's the nature of an internal contest within a party that involves a public conversation about whether they're doing well or not broad conclusion internally they're not as the outwardly the polls illustrate and then away we've gone with this contest over the last few weeks and then this result with me stood in the street alongside some of the reporters and it all happening inside. Let's then bring people the result in case they haven't been glued to their phone or their television eagerly awaiting the result of the Labor Labor Labor deputy leadership contest this morning. I shouldn't be thought that I have these in my head to newscasters who are listening. You're not memorizing the returning officer right now. Actually, I'm Are you going to say I hereby declare? I hereby declare I'm not going to lose anything any if you're bringing me up as a returning officer look. Uh, better than the geography teacher look I normally bring. I think you are just No, don't. Please don't say that. No, but there's no cordroid today. That's a sharper jacket. I here I hereby declare Lucy Pal 87,47 which is 54%. Bridget Phillipsson 73,536 which is 46%. Total number of eligible voters 970,000 and change. Total numbers of votes cast much shorter 160,000 and change. Turnout 16.6%. 6%. Yeah. So, a couple of sort of headline thoughts. Uh, the favorite from the outset won. We should sort of make that perfectly clear. Was she the favorite at the very beginning? Well, okay. Fair ones. Certainly ones that were down to the last two. Yes. Um, because there's a bit of there was a bit of rattling around before that, wasn't there? Yeah. But but it wasn't as clear-cut a win as some thought it might well be. I mean, she there was a 14,000 vote gap, so she clearly won. But you know 5446 is not a you know to the extent to which people were seeing this as a verdict from the party on how the government is doing and how Kestama is doing it wasn't a sort of overwhelming crushing of the candidate who was seen to personify the government in Bridget Phillipsson who sits around the cabinet uh around the cabinet table and as lawyer you've written in the last few weeks sometimes the differences between these two candidates were exaggerated completely um to to women from the north of England who sat around the same cabinet table until seven weeks ago. Yeah. Um but there were differences, there were subtleties and Lucy Pal outside of government was more willing to articulate her critique of government and critique of Downing Street publicly in the process of seeking seeking the votes that she amassed. But that was essentially difference, wasn't it? And the person who won is the candidate who would be more willing to make themsel a pain, maybe even in public in order to get things done than the person who's literally on the government payroll. and Lucy Pal a couple of weeks ago didn't ask answer our question about whether she'd ever be willing to vote against the government which is quite interesting now I think that's unlikely but if there was a policy that she as deputy leader had tried to stop or had tried to change and she felt really hacked off actually technically she's not a member of the government so that would be an that would be an unlikely thing but she just she positioned herself as being I'll be a critical friend rather than I'm someone who is completely part of the tribe and that'll be the fascinating dynamic when a moment comes up. Yeah. Where there is a potential division between Labour backbenches or a sizable chunk of them and the government and it is her own personal decision. It's not a collective responsibility. Yeah. So she would have to decide in that instance and face you know public questioning as to whether or not she's going to back the government um or not and with significant influence depending on which way she decides to go. Because I spoke to David Blancet, now Lord Blunket, a big lab Labour big beast who said if he had got his hands on the process they'd never have run a vote because they're in office now. So you don't need a deputy leader of the party. You've got a deputy prime minister. Yeah. And the party's got a chair as well. So you there are there are roles within the party structure that can be the the voice of the party as opposed to a voice in the government. Uh but um yeah, that's back to the thing where they'd have rather not had to had to run all the way all the way through this. It wasn't me fascinating. So when we were doing our loitering in the street, the whole thing happened. Is that what you call it? Well, that's kind of what it was really because it's been called reporting by the BBC. Well, you know, well, well, we tried a bit of that when there was people to talk to, but there are vast swads of time when there aren't, you know. So, they all go in. That's what these things are for. Well, you know, there was a Well, we were watching it on those things. Um, and uh uh and texting away and all the rest of it. But whilst afterwards we were like, ""Okay, it's all finished and various people are leaving."" There weren't that many people in there at all. Well, I think the only people left in there were the prime minister, Lucy Pal and Bridget Phillipsson. And sure enough, the two of them, uh, the prime minister and Lucy Pal were having a, you know, were meeting and there's, since then, there's been a sort of, you know, glossy picture of them coming out, a last no last no words and you, you know, I mean, it's extraordinary, isn't it, that, you know, seven weeks ago since he sacked her. I know. I mean, funny old business politics and there she was saying, ""Oh, wonderful to have you."" And when I sacked you, what I really meant was I was looking forward to your immediate return within a with another role. Yeah, exactly. The next month, the very next month. Oh, and a role at my behest. And in a role that I can't sack you from unlike the previous one because now she has her own mandate, which is the important thing to understand about the deputy leader is they can't be fired. So they can waltz off in a strop, but they can't be fired. They have their own mandate for the membership. And that's why this role matters. So there, you know, and there are people in government who's like, oh, who've been very dismissive of the chances of Lucy Powell being able to actually exert any influence at all. Some of them are rather cataly, it has to be said, but that's the power that she's got is you can't make her go away unless she makes some terrible mess up. And that's also why deputy leaders over the years have there've been very very different partnerships. So you had sort of we we talked about this, you reported on it a lot in the campaign as well. you know, it's you have the Jeremy Corbin versus Tom Watson. Uh, really tense, really different agendas having a terrible torid time or whether you have the sort of Prescott, I'll be the bluff supporter to you, Tony Blair, and I'll be very, very loyal. I'll speak our messages in a slightly different tone, but I'll be that kind of loyal protector almost. So, it was going to be really interesting to see how the the thing goes. I was peaked or my interest was peaked by what she said about reform. about mention spoke just about not outreforming reform. But more than that, she said we've let far run away with it. Yes. Which and losing the megaphone of politics as she said. So, you know, and and and that's a direct they're not out reforming reform thing is is a direct critique of the prime minister's conference speech just a couple of weeks ago that was all about taking the fight to reform and how that and how that is done and the tone and language in which it's done. We can hear that in this little clip of Lucy Pal saying how she'll change the culture. People feel that this government is not being bold enough in delivering the kind of change we promised. I'll be a champion for our Labor values and boldness in everything we do. And I know that you care as our leader. You want that too and I will be your ally in that fight. It starts with us wrestling back the political megaphone and setting the agenda more strongly because let's be honest, we've let Farage and his ilk run away with it. Ouch. For the prime minister sitting in the front row listening to this former cabinet colleague who sacked offering publicly that critique back. Uh yeah, I mean they they're a little window into this dynamic. I was chatting to Lucy Pal afterwards. there was a bit of an event with various labor activists in a park down the road in the rain. Um, and just to ramp up the the sort of glamour of my morning, you know, um, and uh, and she was saying, and this is back to the point that you've made, Laura, around not overdoing either the differences between the two candidates or necessarily how how Lucy Powell will now sort of prosecute the job. Although, let's see. But she explicitly said, I mean, you probably would say this on day one in this job, wouldn't you? But she did explicitly say, you know, in terms I'll do most of my grumbling in private. Yeah. Um but then most, you know, or whatever. How does that and as I say, there are going to be moments where we journalistically and perfectly reasonably will be seeking her view on issues that are contentious within the party and within the government and where she won't be able to say, oh well, you know, the view she articulates will will be her own. It won't be one that's forced upon her. And she is already on the record, for example, on things like getting rid of some of the limits on benefits for big families. She's already said the government should get rid of what's known as the two child benefit cap. Although it's not child benefit, which always annoys me. It's actually about different kinds of benefits, but that's what it's known as. So, she's already said that's got to go. The government wants to do that, but they might not. Somebody said to me, somebody said to me earlier on that one of the one of the consequences as they saw it because they are an advocate of losing that two child cap. They saw that a positive outcome of this contest was a real racing ahead of that argument that has been going on within Labour for a while. I mean Kia Stubb was saying in opposition it was a as he saw it a good Labor thing they wouldn't be able to afford to do in his judgment. Um but this contest has come at a time where that argument has stepped up not least because both of the final two candidates including you know Bridget Phillips as well making that argument publicly that it had to happen and so pushing that argument along ahead of the budget. So older newscasters will remember a satirical show called the thick of it in which a fictional government trying to maintain its hands on policy and serious issues is constantly assaged by events that you can't control of a more ridiculous nature piling up. So there is nothing funny and satirical about the actual news event that we are talking about. that just as they are running their deputy leadership campaign with the candidate that Down Street did not want to win just as that's actually happening in marches a gigantic news event Chris and there's an extra layer of absurdity here Paddyy because on this weekend where we're finding out the result of the deputy leader of the Labour party who is it within the uh Labour party who is making the announcements it is the it is the chair of the national executive committee of the party who just so happens to be the home secretary, Shapana Mammud, who is another person therefore who rolled up and got out of a car and to whom we could shout a a a governance question rather than a political one, which is how on earth how on earth have we has the country collectively managed to lose perhaps one of the most high-profile criminals of the last couple of months. So Hadouch Kabatu is the man who was jailed for sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl and a woman in Eping in Essex while staying in the asylum Hotel, the Bell, which was the absolute fulcrum of anxiety and protest and upset on all sides all summer. Unless you've been living under a rock, you don't need me to tell you that he was set free in error just weeks after being sent to jail. He was meant to be being sent to a migration center to then be deported and instead, as video seen all over social media shows, he was given his things and allowed to wander off. Now, we're recording at 2:29 on Saturday, so perhaps by the time this reaches your ears, he will have been found. We know he's been spotted in London, but this really is one of this stories where you just think you could not make this up. And you know it's sort of someone in the Labor party was suggesting to me with a with a slightly acidly but in in in Jess that this is kind of you know peak phase two. Remember here summer phase two it's going to be fantastic. We're going to start showing that we're in charge. We know the first year has been tricky but oh brilliant off we go. Actually phase two you've had rainer gone man gone. Deputy leadership contest that they didn't want China. China migrant one in one out policy being a hoke kokei rather than something that right now looks like it might make any meaningful difference and now this and it's but those moments where you you hit the phones as a reporter and you hear down it's either just sort of size or something utterly unbroadcastable along the lines of for goodness sake um because I mean of all people um and and and again just playing into that senses is a phase two thing, but there's that broader sense of and particularly actually in the context of the small boats route which so often comes back to uh incredibly visible daily state failure and in in a failure to be able to deliver what this government and its predecessor have said they've tried to do and this an element of of that where where people and is utterly understandable instantly as well of what how on how on earth does that happen? Yeah. So I went to Liverpool Street station in London which is where it's quite possible that this man exited the train. We know he boarded a train at Chelmsford. It seems likely got off at Liverpool Street. So I asked people getting off the train 24 hours later what they made of it all. And many people are furious. But there's also a feeling among two people I spoke to there that actually the prison service is in crisis. The prison service was not invented by the new Labor government who only arrived year and year and change ago. They've been releasing prisoners. The Conservatives voted against releasing prisoners. Some 200 plus prisoners are released by accident every year anyway. So there is a pro. Why aren't we in the media reporting on the problem of releasing the wrong prisoners before this man was released? Well, that's right. And it was one of the things the government felt compelled to do when they move in was actually release many many prisoners because the prison service was about to collapse. So you know there may well be public sympathy for that uh in that regard. But also without question, even if many people and newscasters are feeling sympathetic because it's been a long-running crisis as a in the politics of it, it's just an absolute shocker. Yeah. Lammy says David Lammy says he's appalled and livid, but you see just appalled, he's livid, but you can't really be appalled and livid about the thing that has happened that's impolling that you're in charge of. Well, you can, but that doesn't solve your problem, does it? And this in the week where the other element of the whole small boat story, the whole one in one out and then oh back in again that sort of sense again uh and and you know and they can point to teething problems. They can point to that the system worked because the biometrics have been taken and so they very quickly established that it was the same guy who' come across before but that where if you like the building blocks of attempting to manage this incredibly tricky issue around small boats twice in a handful of days has spectacularly and very publicly failed and as you say I think it's absolutely right when one of the things about this government that they would say in private is actually their biggest mission and their biggest fear is that they are desperate to show to a sensible middlesized democracy that actually democracy can give them governments that can get things done on their behalf. That's their big challenge which takes us back to what Lucy Pal was saying completely that completely that and all of these incidents just give you again and again that impression that the Jenga Tower is just really really really really shaky and not least because at the heart of that when I speak to senior folk in government it's taking on that point is that can you that that sort of central challenge that this government faces between now and the next election which is that can it can it make the that a government like it can credibly govern, do stuff, achieve stuff, deliver on whatever else it sets out to um because they fear if they can't then they're going to lose. And right now, you know, we can see the arguments that Nigel Farage is making. And when he can point to clear-cut, transparent incidents of repeated failure, that perhaps makes it easier for him to convince those who might not yet be convinced that maybe it's worth a roll of the dice because it in the view of many might not have worked under the Conservatives and might not have worked under Labor State failure. Um and we know that we see problems for the touries who ran the country for 14 years in saying that they didn't have a fingerprints on the problem as well. But on the other hand, I I I said that twice now. This is still a massive catastrophe really for for Labor on their big weekend. So that's really why we had to have you because we can't have this news uh on our own. Well, that is it's No, it's great to be here at the to see the weekend duo. This is This is This is how the sausage is made. This is how the sausage is made. Um it's possible that we might all be on together. Allegedly, we're doing 25 hours of newscast. And Adam's doing 25 hours. Oh yes. Yes. Which goodness, which mean which will make a podcast almost as long as some of the Brexit cast ones we used to do. They're almost as long as this one has felt. Only joking. Um what are you doing tomorrow? So we have we will hear calls from the historian Andrew Looney to release the travel logs of Prince Andrew when he was trade representatives for a decade. Ah and you have Kla Harris. More of our interview with Kla Harris. Yes. And we will also tomorrow that full interview will appear miraculously in your ears too on this newscast feed. And Chris you've described your job as damp loitering if I understand it correctly. Broadly that. Yeah. So I don't think that's fair. I didn't say that. But tomorrow do you have finally a day off? Yes, I am intending, says, as Laura knows all too well, saying this sentence out loud is a massive hostage to fortune, but I am intending tomorrow beyond tilting my eyes and ears in the direction of your broadcasting to have uh to have a day uh where I'm not entirely glued to this the entire time my phone and but yeah, but for now it's back to I've just been looking at some archive of Dennis Healey. So we talk about deputy leaders and all of that, you know, a little bit of a little bit of a knock back to history as we pull together a little TV piece. So bit of that yet a day off with a bit of luck. Very good. Uh we will have Wesing as well, the health secretary who is with us tomorrow morning. So lots to talk to him about uh including Labour's various shockers of the week. And we didn't even mention getting absolutely smashed to bits and losing a seat in Wales that they hadn't lost for a century. goes on the list 11%. I just say I warn you now that the podcast's over and the two of you polit politically in attuned as you are can't have another topic at this hour. So we say spoiling my fun. We say thank you for just being faded out. Sorry. That's what we do on Saturday to the sound of rainfall. Thank you very much for watching, listening, and bothering. Bye. Bye. Bye."
"1kznyTbZro4","'I am not done' - Kamala Harris tells BBC she may run for US president again | BBC News","Former US Vice-President Kamala Harris has told the BBC she may run again for the White House.
In her first UK interview, Harris said she would ""possibly"" be president one day and was confident there will be a woman in the White House in future.
Making her strongest suggestion to date that she will make another presidential bid in 2028 after losing to Donald Trump last year, Harris dismissed polls that put her as an outsider to become the Democrats' pick for the next election.
Speaking to Sunday with Laura Kuennsberg, Harris also turned her fire on her former rival, branding Trump a ""tyrant"", and said warnings she made about him on the campaign trail had been proved right.

I've read it three times. No kidding. Yeah. Because it's it's almost like a thriller. Um but it's clear you don't think losing the election was all your fault. So Madame Vice President, you say you'd underestimated the public's dislike of a frail 81year-old running again. Do you feel that President Biden and his team torpedoed your chances of a fair chance at winning the election? Well, as I've written, um I the buck stops with me in terms of my campaign. It always did. And I take full responsibility for what I did. And and um and that's part of why I wrote the book is to talk about the reflections that I've had on those 107 days, what I thought um were strengths, but what I also thought could have been better. And you know I wrote the book for many reasons and primarily th this election in the US was unprecedented. We had a president of the United States running for reelection and decides not to run three and a half months before the election. The sitting vice president then takes up the mantle running against a former president of the United States who had been running for 10 years with 107 days to go. On behalf of everyone whose story could only be written in the greatest nation on earth. I accept your nomination to be president of the United States of America. It is important to also note that it turned out to be the closest presidential election in the 21st century in the United States. And it was important to me to write this book because it is a part of American history. And I was absolutely intent on making sure my voice would be present when history reflects those 107 days. the the reason that you ended up in that situation and you you say very clearly in the book essentially you didn't have time you didn't have time to make the campaign your own you didn't have time to show the public what you could believe you could really do and you also say President Biden pulling out should not have been a choice for an individual ego or an individual's ambition do you feel that you were deliberately kept in the dark about what was going on and how much he was struggling behind the scenes what I have written is what I believe which is one, we needed more time. There's no question about that. Two, there were many factors that contributed to the outcome of that election. Um, but being mindful of the fact that there were extraordinary people who were involved in those 107 days in building up an inordinate amount for the time that we had, enthusiasm, and dare I say joy around the possibility for our country. And that comes across. But the context here, I think, at this historical moment you talk about, is so important because there had been months of speculation around the world, here in the UK too, even in April, long before President Biden pulled out. We asked Nancy Pelosi what was going wrong. This was a huge subject of discussion. And you write that President Biden didn't raise his frailty with you, and you write that you didn't really raise it with him. That's extraordinary to read in your account. more precise, there is a a a very serious difference between capacity to be president of the United States and the capacity to run for president of the United States. And so it is on that latter piece that I talk about in the book about my concern about his ability with the the level of endurance energy that it requires, especially running against now the current president, the the the total initiative relative to what we're going to do with more border patrol and more asylum officers. President Trump, I really don't know what he said at the end of that sentence. I don't think he knows what he said either. So that is what I speak of in the book and and you rightly point out that I you know in reflection realize that and I ask was it on my behalf grace or recklessness to not raise the point with him about whether it was right for him to run. But let's be clear, my question was never about his capacity to be president. But isn't it a strange message to the public to say, you know what, you need to be tougher and more able to run a political campaign than actually to be the person behind the desk in the Oval Office, to be the person making decisions in the situation room. So, did you just not think it was that bad or did you feel you just couldn't raise it? I was concerned about his ability to run for reelection given what the campaign would require of and requires of any individual regardless of their age and to run while being the sitting president of the United States with all of the responsibilities that that requires. There's a lot of very wellrespected reporting now in the United States that uses phrases like cover up that talks about well widespread concerns and you yourself say in the book it shouldn't have been a choice for an individual's ego. I do reflect on whether I should have had a conversation with him urging him not to run for reelection because of what that would require and given the stakes most importantly because as you know I predicted just about everything that has now happened since the election and we'll come to that and so my concern and especially on reflection is Should I have actually raised it? But as I've also written, uh part of the issue there was that it would would it have actually been an effective and productive conversation given what would otherwise appear to be my self-interest. You say you've reflected on whether you wish you'd had that conversation with President Biden urging him to pull out. In the end, it took other people's voices and even George Clooney writing an article in a newspaper saying it was time to pull the plug. Is it your belief that you would now be president if Joe Biden had pulled out earlier? I can't speculate about that. I do know we needed more time that I'm sure of. But if you needed more time, you might have won and you might therefore be president right now if he had pulled out earlier. That's speculation. Well, that's the logic of what you're saying. You're saying if you'd had more time, you might have won. I'm not going to I can't predict what the outcome would have been, but I am certain we needed more time, 107 days to run for president of the United States against a former president of the United States in this political environment with, as I also have written, the vast amount of miss and disinformation, the need to actually speak with a nation of 330 million people about not only who I am, but what I stood for in terms of the policies that I do believe actually are very um salient and um address the the highest priorities of the American people. 107 days was clearly not enough time to do all of that. And what leaps off every page is you threw yourself into those 107 days. Indeed, I did. And my team did too. I have an extraordinary team. In fact, I've dedicated my book to my team. they from the first day I got the call from uh President Biden on a Sunday afternoon while I was in my sweats with a ponytail having made pancakes and bacon and sausages for my nieces. Um from that day and that afternoon when they all showed up, half of us had been working out and not had even a shower. And for those 107 days, they worked around the clock and left everything on the on the table, everything on the field. And when it comes to your campaign, you've already said the buck stops with you. Indeed, you had massively successful rallies. You had a crazy number of celebrity endorsements. You had Oprah Winfrey turning out for you. You had Taylor Swift backing you. But there's little in the book about why you feel you didn't connect with ordinary voters, those people in the middle who could have gone either way. And indeed, during the campaign, Gen Z and Latinos in some numbers moved across to Trump. You stayed in your comfort zone, didn't you? That was the Democrat's problem. Uh, I received 75 million votes from a variety of people. But in the electoral college, you were not finished. I'm not finished. I received 75 million votes from people around the nation of every stripe, whether it be geographic location, race, gender, and age. And it is true, however, and I and I also reflect and write on that that for pro probably a decade, Democrats have been losing certain sectors of society, and there's work that we need to get done. One of the reasons that I ran on the issue of child care, of Medicare, basically health coverage for home health care for people, for example, who are raising young children and taking care of their parents. One of the reasons I ran on a perspective that we need to make housing more affordable. So, I was offering a $25,000 down credit for f first-time home buyers. I ran on a an agenda that was about going after price gouging, corporations, taking advantage of working people. But why didn't it connect with working people? Well, it did connect with working people, but clearly there was more work to be done. But why? Because we needed more time to talk with more people. And we have to understand the context which is that if you look at the the the trends that had been in play probably at least since if not before 2016 you were seeing for the Democratic party that there was a shift taking place among the demographics you have mentioned and that's work that needs to be done and that's work that I and others are working on to remind people that it has always been the Democratic party that has stood for working people. And the work we need to do going forward is also frankly to provide the contrast because right now we have a president in the Oval Office who is building a ballroom for his rich friends while he is depriving working people of health care during this government shutdown period. Let's talk then about that. There's a evocative moment in the book where you realize you've lost and you say, ""My god, my god, what will happen to our country?"" Yeah. And as you've mentioned, the Trump administration is pulling down the east wing of the White House, turning many conventions on their head. There's a shutdown in the federal government. In the campaign, you said Donald Trump was a fascist. Do you think he's running a fascist authoritarian government? I was asked if he was a fascist and I said yes. And the reason is that I look at what is happening right now and again it is what I predicted. He said he would weaponize the Department of Justice. He has done exactly that. He has used the United States Department of Justice which should be an independent agency that makes decisions based on fact and law and not personal vengeance of the President of the United States. But this is how he has conducted himself. So much so that recently he he has dared to suggest that the United States Department of Justice, which is an agency of the people of America, funded by their tax dollars, should give him 20x number of million dollars because of a prosecution and an investigation that he rightly deserved. You look at what has happened in terms of how he has weaponized for example the federal agencies around going after political satirists who he didn't his skin is so thin he couldn't endure criticism from a a joke and attempted to shut down an entire media organization in the process. And you are critical of billionaires and other institutions bowing down capitulation. There are there are there are not all but there are many that have capitulated since day one who are bending the knee at the foot of a tyrant I believe for many reasons including they want to be next to power because they want to perhaps have a merger approved or avoid an investigation. And it is a crying shame that when push comes to shove, we can't count on the titans of industry to at least posture in a way that is about maintaining the guard rails around a democracy and democratic systems. What then of foreign leaders? I just wonder what did you feel when you heard that Kier Starmer had presented an invitation from the king to Donald Trump in the view of the world's media in the guilt of the oval office. Did you think that was cheesy or did it make you feel queasy or was it obsequious? You know, is there a risk that foreign leaders are being played by Donald Trump because they have to show their close to power? I do believe that Donald Trump, as I said on the debate stage before the election, and I maintain it to be true, has shown his very nature on in the foreign stage. He has proven over a long period of time that he invites favor and flattery. And what I said on the debate stage, like everything else I said and predicted, continues to be true. So you would make that warning to foreign leaders to be careful what they wish for by getting too close. Perhaps foreign leaders will do as they think is right for their country. And yet Donald Trump has made progress of a sorts in the Middle East that President Biden and you, I know you worked hard on this, failed to make. Do you praise the achievements he's made in terms of seeming to move the Gaza Israel conflict towards resolution? Listen, I think that first of all, uh, I'm very, very happy that we now have a situation where the hostages are out. There's still more work to be done. I think credit should be given where credit is due, whether it be Egypt, Qatar, or this administration and this president. There is good work that happened. But there's a whole lot more to do. And as you can see when we're talking about in particular one the fragility of the ceasefire two equally important and something I've been working on since October 8th. What is the plan for the day after which includes the security, the governance and the rebuilding of Gaza. Let's talk then about what's next for you and also what's changed in your life since then. Um, Donald Trump stripped you of your Secret Service protection at a time when there had been attempts on his life. Of course, there have been other political killings in the US, most notably recently, the killing of Charlie Kirk. Has Donald Trump's decision put you in danger? I feel safe. Why do you think he did it? You'll have to ask him. Oh, you must have thought about it. You have to ask him. I I don't pretend to know why people do what they do on a daily basis. In terms then of what is next for you, you write very powerfully about the differences that many women have made to your life, whether that was your meeting with Angela Merkel or the experience of growing up with your extraordinary mother or the stories of your baby nieces, um, Amara and Leela. Um, when are they going to see a woman in charge in the White House? In their lifetime for sure. Could it be you? Possibly. Have you made a decision yet? No, I have not. What about running again as someone else's vice president or maybe being part of another ticket? If Gavin Newsome, your fellow Californian, said, ""Hey, come and be my secretary of state, would you consider that?"" Right now, I'm focused on my book tour. And I'm glad to know that you read it three times. I did. I read it three times because it's a great read. Thank you. But you but you say in your book, I'm not done. That is correct. I am not done. I I I have lived my entire career a life of service and it's in my bones and there are many ways to serve. I've not decided yet what I will do in the future beyond what I am doing right now which is meeting with many people. Obviously right now I'm in the UK but otherwise I've been spending a lot of time in our country. Most recently I was spending an incredible amount of time in the south. I was in Georgia and North Carolina and Alabama and talking with people and mostly listening and I'm enjoying doing that. I think the people want to be heard right now and um one of the reasons that I decided not to run for governor of California. I I want to listen to people without it being transactional, without asking people for their vote, but listening to them. I think the American people have a lot to say right now, but you've been very clear that it's a possibility you might run again to become president. And in my experience interviewing politicians, when someone says, ""I'm not done,"" it means they are thinking seriously about running. But when you look at the bookies odds, uh, they put you as an outsider, even behind Dwayne the Rock Johnson. I mean, is that underestimating you? I think there are all kinds of polls that will tell you a variety of things. I've never listened to polls. If I listened to polls, I would have not run for my first office or my second office and I certainly wouldn't be sitting here in this interview. So your message to supporters at the end of the book was we fought. If you fight, you win. You fought and you lost. But next time? No. My message is as you would have read in the last few chapters was yes, I do believe that when you fight you win, but sometimes the fight takes a while. That was my message. While I concede this election, I do not concede the fight that fueled this campaign. Let's close with a couple of fun things if I can squeeze them in because one of the things that also comes across in the book is part of the maybe the showbiz side of campaigning. You obviously enjoy it and meeting musicians and creative people and coming across and people who you might I think the challenge is you recognize the famous names so you're speaking of them. Um, but there were millions of people that you wouldn't recognize their name who I met with who gave me an incredible amount of joy and um and really continue to give me a sense of confidence in who the American people are and their optimism and their fight and their endurance and their love of country. Is Camela still brat? I you know I think we're going to have to ask that beautiful artist who said it over a year ago. Maybe we'll ask Charlie XTX. What do you miss most about being vice president? Um you I worked with wonderful people and and that was great. I um I mean I the work that I do I do because I want to solve problems and there was good work to be had. And what did you miss the least? Um, I don't know. These are high class problems to talk about things like that, you know. Madame Vice President, thank you so much for giving us your time today. I'm glad to be with you. Thank you. Thank you."

Less than an hour ago, she admitted and offered Miss uh Connelly her congratulations. Despite the concession, counting is continuing and no official results have yet been declared. Tallies from uh count centers show that Katherine Connelly does have a strong lead. She's an independent member of the Irish Parliament whose campaign has been supported by left-wing opposition parties including Shinfane. Let's speak to our Ireland correspondent Chris Page. What are the tallies showing, Chris? Yes, the tallies are showing that Katherine Connelly is on course to be the next president of Ireland and very possibly she might win this presidential election by the largest margin ever. She is, as you say, Martin, a left-wing independent candidate, but she's backed by an alliance of the leftwing opposition parties in the Irish Parliament. The biggest of which is Shinfane. She's been ahead throughout the campaign in the opinion polls and the tallies from count centers all over Ireland today are have been showing consistently. She's got a very strong lead over her opponent Heather Humphre from the center right party fina Gale which is one of the main parties in the coalition government here in Dublin. So the final result will be declared here at Dublin Castle in a few hours time but Heather Humphre has conceded defeat saying she's congratulating Katherine Connelly on becoming the next president of Ireland saying she wishes her uh all the very very best. Just in the last few minutes, we've actually had just the first uh official uh figures from a count uh center and that is from a constituency in Cork City. It's put Katherine Connelly on 64% of the first preference vote. Heather Humphre on 28%. But a very high proportion of spoiled ballots that is proportion is running to more than 10% in that constituency in Cork. And again that is something that we're seeing reflected across the country and it's emerging as really another big story out of this election. People deliberately spoiling their ballots in the main Dublin county center I was earlier this morning. We saw many ballot papers with messages written on them uh about issues such as immigration and crime. Very strongly worded some of them uh to say the least. So politicians particularly from the government parties have been out today saying uh they've got to take this seriously. This is a significant message uh about the number of people in this country who be disaffected by politics in general and also uh by the two candidates on uh the ballot paper. But that's uh putting all that aside. This very much is Katherine Conny's day. She's on course for a landslide victory in this presidential election. What powers does the president have to fix some of the things that people are vexed about? Well, it is a largely ceremonial role. But the president of Ireland has significant influence in shaping the national debates, establishing the nation's values, some would say, and also in representing the country uh abroad. So, Katherine Connelly is a veteran left-winger. uh she has spoken out on foreign affairs throughout her career and during this uh campaign she's criticized the US and the UK uh for their stance on the Middle East. Uh she has criticized other European countries for increasing their uh defense spending and that's something that's drawn uh criticism from her opponents. But Katherine Connley's campaign very much have presented her as the anti-establishment uh candidate against the establishment candidate as they uh see it. Heather Humphre from a party that's been in government here for the best part of 15 years now. And Katherine Connelly, her main line of attack on Heather Humphre is that the Dublin governments repeatedly uh over the last decade and a half haven't resolved a crisis in housing that has seen many people priced out of the uh housing market. And they also haven't given people a rising standard of living even though the economy on paper uh has been uh doing well. So, Katherine Connley, I think, may not be quite as outspoken once she's president as she was whenever she was a backbencher in the Irish Parliament. But nonetheless, we've got a very interesting counterweight going on here between the parties in government and the politician who now be taking up residence in the president's mansion called Arasanut Tron."

There's millions of us taking it religiously every day and on social media we're getting pushed powders, gummies, tablets. Its popularity is soaring. But does it work? I've been taking magnesium now every night um for the past 6 months and honest to God it is helping me to go and relax. It's being described as a miracle supplement that can do lots of different things and sleep is a big one. It's now a multi-billion pound industry and staff at this factory in North Yorkshire are working 24/7 now to keep up with the demand. It supports cell growth. It helps nerves send messages and it even plays a part in helping maintain a healthy heartbeat. But the big question is, does taking it as a supplement help us sleep? We shouldn't be looking to a supplement to try and top this up. We should actually be getting it all from our diet because magnesium is found in sources things like legumes, nuts, seeds, whole grains. to things like your cereals, your whole wheat breads, and even in fruits and vegetables as well. She says for most healthy individuals, all magnesium supplements do is give us quite expensive urine.

"kEgqRMuzMU0","Sex offender released from prison in error last seen in London, UK police say | BBC News","A migrant sex offender who was mistakenly released from prison on Friday was ""last seen in London"", UK police have said, with officers scouring CCTV in an effort to locate him.

Hadush Kebatu was set free in error weeks after being jailed for sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl and a woman in Epping, Essex, while staying in an asylum hotel.

The Ethiopian, who travelled to the UK on a small boat, was due to be moved to an immigration detention centre ahead of his planned deportation when he was released.

UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer described the release as ""totally unacceptable"" and said Kebatu ""must be caught and deported for his crimes"".

Police say an asylum seeker jailed for sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl and a woman in the UK and released from prison by accident has been spotted in London. Essex police have urged anyone who sees Hados Kabatu to call 999 immediately. Kabatu's arrest led to protests in Eping, the town where the assaults took place, and to calls for the hotel that he and other asylum seekers were staying in, to be closed down. The deputy prime minister, David Lammy, was highly critical of the error that saw the offender released. Well, I'm appalled and livid on behalf of the public that Kabatu is at large. He should be deported back to Ethiopia after the sexual assaults that he's committed. And of course, there is now a manhunt with Essex police, the Metropolitan Police, and British Transport Police looking for him. We know that he boarded a train um and is at large in London and of course savage for a full investigation into what's happened and an officer has been suspended. UK deputy prime minister David Lammy there. Well, Danny Shaw is a policing and crime commentator who acted as an adviser to Labour's then shadow home secretary Ivet Cooper in the leadup to the last election. He told BBC Breakfast's Charlie State that he was confident the released prisoner would quickly be recaptured. Well, firstly, I think it beggars belief that this prisoner was released in error of all the prisoners uh who were going to be uh looked after and all the arrangements made for them to ensure that they did their time appropriately and that the eyes were dotted and the tees were crossed. You would have thought Kabatu would be top of that list given the history of that offender and the um debate around asylum hotels and all the controversy that that caused. So, it's a terrible mistake. It appears as though it's an operational mistake by a prison officer or others in Chelmsford prison. Uh, but clearly someone has taken their eye off the ball there and an investigation has got to get to the bottom of that. Um, however, I've got confidence in the police that they will locate Hades Kabatu. The police generally when they're focused on finding a particular individual, they can bring to bear all their resources to do that. And usually in these cases, the person is um is found within 24 or 48 hours. Um he will only have around 76 pounds to spend. That's the discharge grant the prisoners are given. Some of that money has gone on a train fair uh from Shelmsford to London. Uh some of it is it looks as though it's gone on food because he was spotted carrying a bag with some food I think in that footage. So the money will run out pretty quickly. Uh and I expect he will be he will be found. Yes, you all have seen Danny those images you're referring to uh those uh pictures assumed to be the man who's on the run and carrying a bag as you say. When you saw those pictures, what what were your thoughts? Well, I mean, he looked slightly bewildered and I I imagine that he was expecting to go to an immigration center where he was going to be deported back to Ethiopia and suddenly he's given, you know, his belongings back um £76 in cash and told you're free to go. So perhaps he doesn't quite understand why that's happened. None of us really understand how that's happened. Um but nevertheless, he's got on a train to London. Perhaps he has friends or family or some connections in London. And I think what the police will be doing is trying to find out uh if he does have people uh there. They'll be trying to find out if that's where he's gone. They'll be looking at phone numbers that he was calling from prison because they will have those numbers to see whether those numbers have been called uh by him and if so try and trace those calls back to try and locate him. They'll also be scouring CCTV uh from the train station and then working forwards uh to see where he's gone uh after arriving at Liverpool Street, presuming that that's where he ended up. Um so I expect that they will find him. He also is quite distinctive looking. His clothes are pretty distinctive. Um, so you know, alerting the public is something else that will help in the manhunt. Danny Shaw there. Well, before being arrested, the offender was housed in the Bell Hotel in Eping. The local MP, Conservative Neil Hudson, told the Today program on BBC Radio 4 that the government was ultimately responsible for the mistake mistaken release. And we've seen, as you've heard on your program, the mistaken release of prisoners has more than doubled in the last year. and and this sounds like an operational error, but the buck has to stop somewhere and it has to stop at the top at the Justice Secretary, the Home Secretary and the Prime Minister. And um they have said that they are livid and appalled. Well, quite right, they should be livid and appalled, but that's that's not good enough. And the Labor government needs to get a grip of this issue. They need to apprehend this man, but they've got to sort this issue out. And that's what my constituents who are deeply distressed and and upset are saying. We heard from our correspondent earlier that there was a a new protest outside the hotel last night as a result of this. Absolutely. Yes. We saw a another flash protest last night. And I think we must remember this this issue hasn't gone away for our community in Eping. Although it's leading the stu the news stories today, this has not gone away. We've had uh twice weekly protests in the town for weeks and weeks and weeks and and as you have said um earlier in the summer some of these protests uh became violent and we've seen you know people injured. We've seen eight police officers injured. So this is something that we don't want to see uh rising up again and and no one in our community wants to see your hometown leading the news day in day out and it's leading the news today. I just must, you know, remind people this has not gone away for the people of Eping. This has been there and now this has brought it back to the surface and and people are deeply deeply distressed. I know as as you said that the key thing that needs to happen now is that this man needs to be caught again. But in terms of repercussions, uh the LibdMP for Chelmsford, for example, Marie Goldman, uh has said she's thinking about the idea, you know, should should there be a call for the governor of of HMP Chelmsford, the prison that that he was in that he should have been picked up from and taken to the the detention center for them to resign? What do you think should happen in terms of accountability? I think as I've said accountability must go right to the top in terms of the ultimate responsibility for the the the justice system is the justice secretary and above the justice secretary is the prime minister and as I've said they have said uh their emotions today they they sound like they are commentating on the situation and what needs to happen is accountability. We need to find out in parliament exactly what has gone. There's obviously been an operational error, but accountability in government stops at the top. And and this go this Labor government is presiding over an immigration crisis and also a a crisis in in the prison system. And really what needs to be done, we've got to apprehend this man. And and the government must throw everything at helping uh Essex police to find this man. And I I thank the police for what they're doing because if we think about the protests uh through the summer, they've had to police in incredibly difficult situations. As I've said, you know, police officers have been injured in the protests. This is through no fault of their own that this prisoner was released, but they need to get a grip and find this man. But very importantly, they need to get a grip on the immigration issue. But for my town of Eping, they've got to act quickly and we've got to get this hotel closed. There's Neil Hudson, the MP for Eping."
"tWFhWjFqkA8","Who is Zohran Mamdani, frontrunner for New York City mayor? | BBC Americast","Voting starts on Saturday for one of America’s biggest and most prominent political positions. 

How did Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic nominee, emerge as the frontrunner to be the next mayor of New York, despite being virtually unknown at the start of his campaign?   

Sarah, Justin and Anthony look in more detail at his policies, and in particular the centrepiece of his campaign around the cost of living. Mamdani says he will make New York more affordable, by increasing housing stock, raising taxes for the rich and bringing down the cost of rent. How realistic are his promises and how much could it matter if he can’t deliver? We also unpack his views on Israel and Gaza, and how his views on Gaza could affect the Jewish vote in New York, the biggest outside of Israel.   

We get an inside track on Mamdani’s campaign from Eric Lach, staff writer at the New Yorker, who has been following him on the campaign trail, from before he won the primaries, to having dinner at Mamdani’s apartment in Queens. He also shares his views on how Mamdani will handle the NYPD, the country’s largest police department, after calling for the police to be defunded in 2020.  

Donald Trump has made clear he thinks Mamdani is a radical left communist, so how might he handle the US president if he is elected as mayor? And how might Donald Trump target New York in return?

Who was leading the state? It was you. Governor Hok leading the state. Governor, there's a new kid on the block in American politics. His name is Zoran Mandani and he's about to become almost certainly the next mayor of New York City. A hugely important position in American politics. Not just because you're in charge in New York, but also of course because you have a wider relationship with other politicians and crucially with Donald Trump. And that relationship could be very tricky because Zoran Mandani calls himself a socialist and wants to do things in New York like making the buses free, like having cityowned shops, uh like controlling the rent in a lot of places that Donald Trump doesn't think much of. He also wants to raise taxes by the way on businesses and wealthy individuals. So Zoran Mandani with a huge task in New York City, but also of course a relationship to manage with Donald Trump who has said he's going to do him some damage at least politically in the future. I looked at the polls and uh looks like we're going to have a communist as the mayor of New York. It'll be very interesting. But here's the good news. He's got to go through the White House. He has said he'll take over New York if Mandami wins. And he will because he has no respect for him. He thinks he's a kid and he's going to knock him on his tukus. You could turn on TV any day of the week and you will hear Donald Trump share that his pick for mayor is Andrew Cuomo. And he wants Andrew Cuomo to be the mayor, not because it will be good for New Yorkers, but because it will be good for him. Americast from BBC News. Hello, it's Sarah here in the BBC's bureau in Washington and it's Anthony right next to Sarah here in Washington DC and it's Justin in the worldwide headquarters of American, England. Um, and I should say right at the beginning, this episode is coming to you very much by popular demand. A lot of you particularly on the Discord server um have been asking us to look at Zoran Mamani, the man, the phenomenon, the whole business of what is about to happen in New York in much more detail. And that Sarah Anthony is what we're going to do today. Yeah. and joined by uh a guest, a New Yorker who's actually followed Zoran Mandami around a lot of his campaign, spent time with him out on the streets, had dinner in his apartment, and he has some very interesting thoughts on just how Mandame might handle Trump if he's elected, as well as why his election campaign seems to be going so well. Okay, first things first, uh Anthony, we ought to set out first of all why being mayor of New York is is so important. I mean, there's an obvious reason, isn't there? New York is a big place. It's kind of it's it's it's the size of of um a medium-sized country when it comes to its economics and indeed it's its population, but it's more than that. And New York is America's most populous city. It's also, if you ask New Yorkers, its most important city. Uh and they have grounds for saying that because it is the financial capital of the United States, if not the world. Uh it is a a major port. It is also a cultural center for this country. It is a center of media which I think has a lot of relevance because things that happen in New York and in New York politics tend to resonate across the country. Say real estate developers who make their name in New York and sometimes go on to higher office. I think we can think of one in particular who has done that. It also has one of the largest police departments uh in this country. A police department that's larger than the Army of Belgium I believe. uh and it has about $116 billion uh in its uh annual budget and 300,000 employees. So, New York City is a big place and it is a very important place when it comes to American politics. So, even though we're just talking about a mayor, this is just one city. It is a mayor that has a unique platform and cultural visibility in this country uh compared to no one else in this country in in local politics. There's been a lot of very famous mayors of New York, haven't there? I mean, I'm immediately thinking of Mike Bloomberg and Rudy Giuliani, but I'm sure you can remember others further. Bill Delasio, you know, who who also came in as a kind of a a progressive reformer just a few years ago and and then there was a lot of hype around him as the new face of the Democratic party, the kind of Bernie Sanders uh who actually got elected to an influential office and then that all kind of uh petered out. I mean the the list goes uh on and on and it can be a very powerful position. A position where someone has vision and political skills can really change the face of New York. You think about Rudy Giuliani, what he did with fighting crime or Bloomberg uh the way he changed uh New York's finances and the operations of of New York and modernized uh some of that. So it it is but it also is a a role with a certain amount of limitations. There are limits to power and limits that Mani with all of his promises could run headon into if he gets elected. Yeah, we need to talk about some of those limits because it is really interesting what he can and can't do. Before we get though to him, just on the subject of who the candidates are this time round, something immediately strikes me from what you've just said, Anthony, and that list of people, that list of famous New York mayors is it's both parties and and and Republicans can win and have won uh very successfully and govern successfully in New York in the past. But this time round, um, if we go through the candidates and there is a Republican candidate, are we saying we are certain that he can't win? I think we're fairly certain he can't win. This is Curtis Silwa, who's been around in Republican and New York politics for quite some time. Uh, I believe he he founded a a law enforcement group, an independent law enforcement group, the Guardian Angels, I think that's what they they're called. uh uh that had a certain amount of notoriety in in in trying to clean up the streets of New York, but he doesn't have a broad popularity base and and according to polls, he is not a real factor in this. And it takes a unique set of circumstances for a Republican like Rudy Giuliani or Bloomberg, although he got to switch back and forth between Republican and independent and Democratic for them to to break through and and win a race in New York City. But in this circumstance, he's really uh kind of the the the third in line here for for the job. The big name that everyone might remember, of course, is Andrew Cuomo, right? Yeah, absolutely. Because he was governor of New York and during co he was uh he was much lauded and praised, wasn't he? Everybody thought that he was running New York better than Trump was running America, the early stages of um co and he was being talked about as having a great bright future. But then uh there were some sexual harassment allegations and he resigned under a a cloud and that all got very very messy and we might have thought we'd seen the last of him but no no he came back to fight to get the Democratic nomination to stand for mayor. He didn't. That went to Zoran Mami. So he is running well essentially as an independent um here but everybody knows he's a Democrat. Everybody remembers him being a Democratic um governor of the state. And so potentially you could be splitting the left-wing vote there, which is uh what seems to be giving Zam Dami such a great chance. Yeah. And and we should mention the incumbent, shouldn't we? I mean, there is a mayor of New York at the moment, but he's dropped out, hasn't he? Eric Adams. This is the very strange guy accused of various pieces of corruption and weirdly close now to Donald Trump. Um he hasn't endorsed anyone, has he? But but he's he's not going to be much of a factor. In other words, he doesn't have a a block really, does he, of people that he can deliver to a candidate. Is that is that right? Uh he was uh he was polling in the single digits, the low single digits as the incumbent running for reelection. That kind of prompted him uh to drop out, although apparently after the debate that we heard clips from just then last night, he went to a a Knicks NBA game and sat next to uh to Andrew Cuomo. So uh the two of them have been linked together but he is basically a non-factor in this race. The big factor of course is Zhran Mamani who is polling near a majority of the uh the entire race. Uh and he is a newcomer to the scene. Yeah. He's not exactly um Anthony what you might expect for somebody who is so far ahead, is he? He's very young. Um he's the first Muslim mayoral candidate for New York and he's pretty left-wing. and we'll get into some of the details of his policies and the very big promises that he's making, but he has really burst onto the scene in New York. He's captured a huge amount of attention. He's very charismatic. Um, he's got a big big following, very devoted following from younger voters as well. Uh, and it's that it's his personality as well as his politics that have really shaken up this race. Yeah, let's get a taste of that, Sarah, because the thing that first brought him to a lot of people's attention was his ability on social media and the videos that he was putting out and the appeal of those videos, both in policy terms, but also just his ability to communicate. Every politician says New York is the greatest city on the globe. But what good is that if no one can afford to live here? City Hall is engulfed in corruption. Unscientific, the cost of living is the real crisis. New Yorkers are being crushed by rent and child care. The slowest buses in the nation are robbing us of our time and our sanity. Working people are being pushed out of the city they built. A mayor could change this and that's why I'm running. Yeah, I think it's interesting you see the the laser-like focus he has in this clip and throughout his entire campaign on economic issues, on cost of living issues. You know, there's a lot of talk about Democrats uh focusing too much on cultural issues and getting distracted. Well, here is someone who is of the left who's not talking about cultural issues so much, even though he has an interesting cultural background. He's talking about affordability. And I think that is one of the things that has really resonated with a lot of New Yorkers and allowed him to to slip uh past some of the critiques of him as lacking experience or being too extreme on the left. Tell you, I heard praising him the other day, Anthony, and and that was David Axelrod. So right from the center ground of the party kind of Obama or he was the Obama the guy in a sense who invented Barack Obama went on to work for him in the White House um is is absolutely mainstream Democratic party but has always said and was fiercely critical of the Biden administration and if I seems to me if you've interested David Axelrod who brought Obama to the White House and is very much a centrist and is also uh the the son of Jewish immigrants from Europe incidentally and that is relevant as well when you think of Mandami's position particularly on the Palestinian issue. If you can interest someone like that through your political talent, it just seems to me you're getting somewhere. Yeah. Not just David Axarrod Justin. I've seen on social media um your favorite Democratic adviser James Carville also saying exactly the same thing saying he teaches politics and he would use this campaign as a model um for how to stick with the campaign discipline and get your message across. Right. And and let's be honest, there are some very real problems with affordability in New York City. I think the average New Yorker spends more than 50% of their income on housing. Uh the cost of housing is high. uh about half the houses, apartments in New York City are rent controlled, which means there is a a city agency that determines how much rent can go up, which on one hand, if you have one of those rent controlled apartments, it's great. Uh you know, you live a much better lifestyle than you would if you had a non-rencrolled apartment because those rents go up. But it also is contributing to scarcity in the city. They just aren't building a lot of new housing and that is driving up prices as well. I I think the bigger picture is he's making proposals in the same way that Donald Trump does. He identifies needs and concerns of the Americans, comes up with something to say this is what I want to do. People say, ""Ah, well, you know, that's not realistic, but at least they believe that the candidate understands the nature of the problem and wants to do something about it."" Yeah, Anthony, that's exactly right. And because I've been thinking as well that there were sort of echoes of Trump in this because I'm not sure that the people voting for him necessarily believe that he will be able to do everything that he's promising. Um but they like the idea of it. They think that he's on the same page as them and that even just trying to address some of these issues um would be a big step forward. And so yeah, there is there is something slightly Trumpian about making big promises in the hope that it's the vibes that people get from um what it is you're saying you would do. Let's listen to how he deals with the criticisms that say you don't know what you're talking about. You can't do any of these things that you want to do. you don't even have the power to do them because they're not done from the mayor's office. So, that was very much a feature, wasn't it, of that debate that we've had a little clip of. Let's hear a bit more of it with um Andrew Cuomo kind of kicking off the attack on him. You have never had a job. You've never accomplished anything. There's no reason to believe you have any merit or qualification for 8 and a half million lives. You don't know how to run a government. You don't know how to handle an emergency. and you've literally never proposed a bill on anything that you're not talking about in your campaign. You had the worst attendance record in the assembly and you gave yourselves the highest raise in the United States of America. You went from $110,000 to $140,000 and then you never showed up for work and you missed 80% of the votes. Shame on you. Shame on you, ladies. Always a pleasure to hear Andrew Cuomo create his own facts at every debate stage. The first thing I want to say here is I love New York debates. I love New Yorkers debating. I mean, it is throwing elbows and mixing it up. I love the accents. I love everything about that. Uh we should also talk about a little bit about what Mum Donnie is proposing because because he is proposing some some real policy issues. One is free buses. Another is uh state-run grocery stores in places where there isn't enough uh grocery markets and things. these these food deserts as they call. Uh free uh free child care for infants uh in New York. Uh of course all of this comes with a price tag, doesn't it, Sarah? Yeah, I mean it sounds very expensive and he's pretty straightforward about how he would raise the money um because you've got quite a lot of power to raise taxes um as the mayor of New York. And so it would be increasing income tax on everybody who makes more than a million dollars a year. That would go up by 2%. H and he wants to increase the corporation tax as well from um just over 7% to uh 11 a.5%. H and he says even just the personal income taxes would raise $4 billion. Um I've heard though interviewed about this uh and asked if there were other ways that he could do this. He's pretty flexible on the fundraising, but what but what he is doing is very open about saying to achieve this the richest people will have to pay more tax in order to fund these improvements for people who have less. He's he's he's very open and straightforward about that. Although one of the things there is whether he does or doesn't have those powers and actually that the argument is for a lot of businesses is he doesn't have those powers. They really are they reside with the governor of the state of New York Kathy Hokll who is a Democrat but he's not at all keen on uh Mandani and also not at all keen on raising taxes because of course in America you have a choice as a business indeed as an individual and people exercise that choice. you can go to a state with lower taxes and the big risk if taxes do go up. It's not a kind of magic money tree because there is a risk that people will go. Now, you can say they won't go, they'll end up just paying the taxes and staying. But Anthony, it is it's a live debate, isn't it? Can you actually raise the kind of money that he says he wants to spend? Yeah. And you point out rightly that that Hokll controls that she's a centrist. She has endorsed Mumani, but I think it was kind of grudgingly uh but very late. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. And and and so I guess Mumdani's theory uh is that he wins. He gets a mandate from the voters. He is able to to use that to to pressure other politicians and pressure the state to give him the flexibility uh to do that. But it is going to take uh you know a lot of a lot of skill to try to to try to get the the state to go along with with any of the things he's uh he's proposing. I mean the the the the mayor of New York has not so much power over taxing and that is one which concerned a lot of the the wealthy people who live in New York. They're they're terrified that they're they're going to get hit with a billionaire's tax because there are quite a few really wealthy people who live in in New York. Uh and two that uh that he's it's also something that's very unrealistic for him to be able to pull off. Now talking of the police um Anthony whom you mentioned there it is a very big issue in New York policing and Justin you've said in the past I don't disagree with you that that among the stupidest things that Democrats could ever say was when they were campaigning to defund the police and that turned off a lot of voters. Well Mami is on that list. He had um h said way back in about 2020 or something I think around about the time of the George Floyd protest that the police should de be defunded. He said that the the New York police were racist and anti-quer. He was very very critical of them and that has come up of course during the campaign. So um he has he has now properly apologized. Uh he's gone round to various police stations and done so. He's done it on television said that he was wrong about that that he has learned more since he was elected to the state assembly. He's met um far more police officers and that he's he's sorry he ever said that and he doesn't he no longer has those views. Um is that enough do you think? Yeah, I think it is actually. I mean, and I think he's done what um in a way Kamla Harris never quite managed to do, which is to stand up and address the things that they regret saying in the past and say openly, I regret saying this. I no longer believe it. I think he has that kind of Trump inability just to move on. And I'm not suggesting that he's moving on in quite the way that Donald Trump does move on from subject to subject and position to position. But fundamentally, I think in the modern era, you are able, if you can convince people that in your guts you're getting things right, you're able to to move on. And it's what Kla Harris never quite managed to do. And it seems to me that Mandani does have at least a chance of doing it. Yeah. And another area where he's had to try to explain past statements and tried to move on and done so uh fairly effectively if you look at the polls now is on uh Israel and the Gaza war on his past statements criticizing Israel calling uh what Israel is doing a genocide. Uh and he he has been able to thread that needle a bit too coming up as one of these politicians coming out of kind of the Palestinian movement and with his background as a as a Muslim. He was uh born in Uganda. His parents uh or were influential influential figures. But uh it is interesting to see how he's managed to try to explain those positions as well. Yeah, it's interesting, Anthony, isn't it? That he's actually polling not too badly with Jewish voters. Uh a lot of um younger Jewish voters. Um but this whole thing did come up. Um his relationship with Jewish voters came up in the debate last night. um because the Republican candidate Curtis Silva wanted to talk about it. But let me speak on behalf of my two sons. When they've heard some of the statements you've made like in support of global jihad and I hear some people out there saying the Jews their time is due, which means the same thing. They're frightened. They're scared. They view you as the arsonist who fan the flames of anti-semitism. They cannot suddenly accept the fact that you're coming in like a firefighter and you're going to put out these flames. You've got a lot of explaining to do, a lot of apologizing to do. My sons are afraid. their family, their friends. Many in the Jewish community are concerned if you become mayor because they don't think when anti-semitism re its ugly head, which it's now doing more than ever before, that you will have the ability to come in and put out those flames of hate. Okay. Yes, you can. I think there is room for disagreement on many positions and many policies, but I also want to correct the record. I have never, not once, spoken in support of global jihad. That is not something that I have said and that continues to be ascribed to me. And frankly, I think much of it has to do with the fact that I am the first Muslim candidate to be on the precipice of winning this election. Now, I all the same, Curtis, I do still want to be the mayor that will keep your sons safe, that will keep every single New Yorker safe. And it is my job to not only deliver on that commitment but also to ensure that New Yorkers feel it every single day that they live in this city. Okay. I mean he answers it quite forcefully there but it it is true to say isn't it? He got into some difficulties. He was on a a a podcast and he was asked about the phrase globalize the interifard and he wouldn't condemn it as a phrase and I think he said the word interifard can mean struggle but obviously to a lot of Jews the interifard is is the uprising uh in in Israel and the West Bank which has led to the killing of civilians and that that caused him I think it's probably right to say that caused him the most difficulty of any of the statements he's made about Israel and the Palestinians. Yeah. He's also made statements uh questioning Israel's right to exist. He said, ""For any state, I'm not going to recognize its right to be a state with a hierarchy of citizenship on the basis of religion, race, etc. Uh my critiques of Israel, critiques that I would hold for any other state violating any one of those other international laws."" So essentially it he's saying Israel as it's constituted now as the way it operates he does not recognize that that kind of a state to operate that way. Now we've al said a couple of times um during the course of this episode that we've been comparing Mami to Trump. Well Donald Trump himself seems absolutely fascinated by him. He talks about him a lot but not in flattering terms. um he um writes him off as a communist and says he'll destroy New York City and threatens that he will do as much as he can to withdraw federal funds from the city to try and styami's agenda. And the result is that Mandami's opponents are saying don't take the chance of voting for this guy because if he becomes the mayor, you're going to have the full force of the US president and the federal government attacking your city. Why would you want to put somebody like that in office? And Donald Trump does frequently refer to him as a a communist. Um, here he is just a few days ago. I looked at the polls and uh looks like we're going to have a communist as the mayor of New York. It'll be very interesting. But here's the good news. He's got to go through the White House. Everything goes through the White House. At least this White House, it does. And we'll have to see what happens. I don't know that I want to get involved. It's really a question of would I rather have a Democrat or a communist. And I would rather have a Democrat than a communist. Mom Donnie if he wins. Yeah, I'll speak to him. I think they'll get on fine. Actually, I think they both they've both got, as we've been saying, they've both got an they've both got a populist appeal. They're both very good communicators to the enormous annoyance of their opponents. In the end, they'll probably end up just living with each other, won't they? Yeah, that'll be an interesting dynamic to watch. Obviously, Trump has a lot of influence and a lot of uh ways he can punish New York City. Already punishing New York City by suspending some of these big projects. A tunnel from New Jersey to Manhattan has been put on hold during during the shutdown. There there's funding that he could he could cut off that would also really punish New York State and New York City if he wants to play hard ball. Let's listen to what they said at the debate because it came up. It's such an important issue, isn't it? He has said he'll take over New York if Mandami wins. And he will because he has no respect for him. He thinks he's a kid and he's going to knock him on his tukus. Look, Donald Trump ran on three promises. He ran on creating the single largest deportation force in American history. He ran on going after his political enemies. And he ran on lowering the cost of living. If he wants to talk to me about the third piece of that agenda, I will always be ready and willing. But if he wants to talk about how to pursue the first and second piece of that agenda at the expense of New Yorkers, I will fight him every single step of the way. Mdan is the kind of candidate, the kind of politician that a lot of Democrats uh say they want. They want someone who is younger, someone who is leftwing, who proudly espouses progressive ideas. He he does that, who's willing to mix it up with his opponents and throw elbows. I mean, we heard from all of these clips, he is more than more than able to to stick up for himself in a debate. Uh, and then is charismatic as someone who can can really uh paint a vision for the future. Now, you know, this is this doesn't necessarily mean he's going to be successful as mayor, but uh this does mean he might have a chance to really rocket out of this and become bigger than just the mayor of New York. and the fact that he's running against Andrew Cuomo who is the face of the Democratic old guard, the face of the establishment, as I mentioned, the son of a governor, someone who's whose family name has been around New York politics for decades, a half century practically. Uh this really gives him the opportunity to paint that contrast even more. Justin, probably important to point out um at this point that although he might be a model for the kind of person the Democrats might want to take into being their presidential candidate in 2028 or beyond, it cannot be him. Zoran Mandami was born in Uganda. And although he is now a naturalized citizen, I think he he cannot run for president because he was not born in the United States. Um now I'm going to have to run, not for office. Um but uh back to an edit while I thought there was an announcement there. No, I I have to get on with my um day's work, so I am going to have to leave you at this point. I'm afraid I will as well. Justin, you're going to have to do this interview by yourself, but I have the utmost confidence in you. Thanks, guys. Bye-bye. Okay, let us talk now to Eric Latch, who is a staff writer at the New Yorker. He's been following Mandani on the campaign trail, but not just on the campaign trail. He's actually spent a lot of time with him, including having dinner at his apartment in Queens. So Eric, you are exactly the right person to talk to. Welcome to the podcast. Thanks so much for having me. What is it about him that has enabled him to get to where he is? And I don't I'm not interested at the moment in policy. I'm interested in in his abilities, his political abilities and and his character. Yeah. I think two two words come to mind immediately. One is one is confidence and the other is discipline. I mean this is a guy he you know his these now famous sort of policy slogans that he has sort of uh deployed to great success. Uh you know he hit on this from from from the moment he jumped into the mayor's race uh at this point more than a year ago. um you know, he he had a clear uh and detailed plan for how he was going to run for mayor that he stuck to all the way through. And you know, and and for as and and and you know, I say this in the in my article, for as successful and and sort of um vivid and and winning a communicator as he is on, you know, in public, you know, on his internet presence and his social media videos, you know, in person, he is he is a shrewd and careful um um um um um you know, he he he is he is he is controlled and he says what he wants to say. He doesn't get knocked off message very much. That's really interesting you use that word careful because we've we've just used all sorts of adjectives to describe him in the discussion that we've just been having among ourselves, but careful wasn't one of them, but of course in a politician um authenticity is important and all the rest of it, but actually the message discipline that you've stressed is really interesting. They're not just slogans, freezing the rent and making buses free and and and universal child care and raising taxes on the wealthy. They are they are a kind of um they are a kind of rhetorical playbook that he turns to again and again and again. Yeah. Do do you if you look at a specific area like for instance the police which is somewhere where he does have some power. We were saying earlier in our discussion he has basically changed his mind. He used to say what a lot of people on the progressive left said didn't he about the police defund the police etc etc. He doesn't say that now. We were just wondering whether that is convincing or not. I mean, has it been, In other words, is he bringing with him people who are not necessarily sold on all the progressive left stuff, but still trust him? Yeah. Look, I mean, you know, I I say in my article, like I think he's had a hard time describing what changed his position here, except for the fact that he's now running for mayor when it comes to managing the police department. I think it's I think it is a a a you know, it's going to be a very live um and and complicated series of questions that he faces if he does take office in January. you know, not just not just the general rhetorical way that he talks about the police, but very very specific questions that are going to come up inevitably as mayor about how the police in New York uh treat protesters, about how they treat uh homeless people, about how they, you know, and on down the list of just kind of like the day-to-day decision-m um and problems that a that a mayor faces. So that that I think is is definitely going to be um you know a kind of front and center issue for him if he does become mayor. That said, you know, he he just just yesterday uh you know, at the debate last night, he confirmed some reporting that had come out that um that said that he you know, plans to ask uh the current police commissioner, Jessica Tish, uh who is um you know, no one's idea of a democratic socialist uh to stay on as police commissioner as as a kind of show of of sort of embracing, you know, not just um the the the ideological partners that have helped him get to this point. Yeah. And it is fair to say, isn't it, that the central message, the affordability message is something that has just taken off. And anyone who dismisses that as being hot air or or or kind of a political smoke and mirrors isn't isn't getting a really central part of his appeal. I I mean I think all you have to do is look at the way that Andrew Cuomo, the former governor who lost to Mumani in the in the primary and then is now challenging him as an independent in the general has I mean in the in the primary Cuomo made a bet that the election was going to be about public safety and Mumani made a bet that it was going to be about affordability and Mdani won that that that contest and since then you know Cuomo has has been a lot more um focused and and a lot more uh uh uh uh uh you know acknowledging that the issue of affordability is is is is is perhaps the the the the top top issue for many many voters in in in New York City. And on that can he deliver? You know, his central policy proposal in the campaign was to freeze rents on um you know, pardon my my I'm going to put my my wonk hat on for just like a half second here, but it's like proposal to freeze rents um uh you know, for freeze rents on on housing units, apartments in New York City that are that fall under um some pretty unique um rent control laws that New York's has on the books here, but those only represent about a quarter of of the city's total housing stock. So, it's about about a million um housing units in the city. About 2 million people live in those apartments. So for for the threearters of the rest of the city, you know, that that freeze the rent proposal doesn't apply uh directly. Um and you know, the the broader question of how to fix or address the runaway unaffordability in the city, even Mdani acknowledges is not the the rent freeze is not that, you know, that's not getting your arms around the whole problem. Um it's a it's a it's an area. It's a it's a big chunk of of of policy space where the mayor holds some powers. We were just talking about sort of what are the mayor's powers. Well, here here here's an example of a place where he does hold some cards. Um how that then spills out into the broader debate about what to do about housing costs and rent costs and and and and and the high cost of building in New York and just how jam-packed New York already is um with with with uh with building and with people. um you know is is is just that's just yeah that you know that's just it's like the first chapter of what's going to be probably a very long book. I just wonder about what we should make of his relationship with the rest of the Democratic party. You know so far it's been a very uneasy getting to know you period. Um it's you know he has he has won over a few um Democrats who who sort of greeted him skeptically. I mean, he certainly represents a kind of um, you know, an insurgent faction in the Democratic party that's been in conflict with mainstream and establishment leaders um and and interests in within the party. Um, you know, he's he's he's had a little success this summer. I mean, CA Governor Kathy Hokll in New York has endorsed him uh and is, you know, they've they've spent the summer sort of speaking warmly about each other uh in various ways. they seem to sort of see eye to eye on the idea of making uh you know child care for for young kids, you know, a reality in in in the city. Um but, you know, some of the other I mean, it just so happens that the leader of the Democrats in the Senate, Chuck Schumer, and the leader of the Democrats in the House of Representatives, Hakeem Jeff, are both New Yorkers, both from Brooklyn, and both have yet to endorse Mumani. And and and really there's been very little movement. uh on that in the in in the past few weeks. I mean, there's just there's no indication that that sort of either side is warming uh to the other here. That's quite pointed, isn't it? Given what you point out that they're both New Yorkers. I mean, what do they in in the end, are they going to have to just do it or can they just hold out and not do it? I I wonder what the thinking is there. you know, it it's it's it's there's there's there's some layers to this, but you know, what's been reported, what people talk about, what seems to sort of be sort of the widely acknowledged as as sort of the the important factors in in this dynamic, I mean, has to do with um you know, both both Schumer and and and and Hakee Jeff, particularly Schumer, you know, are long-standing supporters of of Israel. Um and uh you know the Democratic Party donor base you know is full of longtime supporters of Israel and um Mumani's criticisms of the Israeli government Israeli government's war in Gaza um you know that they they this is an impass you know this is a this is a sort of a political point that they that seems like they these these different these these different players can't can't, you know, don't see a way to resolve. Um, you know, but and it also has to do with um, you know, both Schumer and Jeffre are looking at midterm maps uh, for 2026. Um and you know and and and and and you know this is a national issue but it but it also has to do with New York City's backyard because because New York City has these um suburbs to the north um you know in upstate New York and then to the east on Long Island where for the past several cycles there's been these like very hotly contested house races that have really kind of determined the balance of power in the House of Representatives and um you know those those districts are full of the the The stereotype is that like, you know, these suburbs in eastern Long Island are full of cops and firefighters and sanitation workers that sort of come into the city and out every day and and and sort of, you know, just are are are not um philosophically disposed to embrace a kind of uh you know, a democratic socialist pitch or or a kind of idea of like the city is a place where, you know, social spending needs to increase or or or that, you know, that that that that kind of needs to just take a take a pivot. it to the left. Um, and sort of how Mumani's politics get talked about in those suburbs, you know, and then sort of by extension in in in in sort of districts across the country, I think, is something that's also on on a lot of Democratic leaders minds. That then brings us finally back to him because you've seen him campaigning. You've seen him sort of onetoone with voters on the street. Do you think he's got what it takes to bring in a much wider group of people than just those who would obviously support it? Yeah, I I mean I I I'll I'll answer the question, but I think the deeper one embedded there, you know, is a is is an old one, which is just kind of like how does the New York City mayor matter in terms of national or or or even international politics. like it's a big job with a high profile comes you know with a lot of power but complicated power as we've discussed sort of hemmed in in various ways again the velocity of this I think is something that we should all kind of just take a breath about you know six months ago most people in New York did not know who this guy was you know it's it's you know it's it's it's it's and so so this is all sort of very very new and the question of can he consolidate his power and then and then and then use that as a platform to sort of say things that resonate beyond beyond the city. I mean, you know, I think I think the potential is there. Certainly, you know, certainly mayors mayors since time in memorial have had have had bigger aspirations and have hoped to have make an impact sort of more broadly. And so, so, so I I think I think discounting it, you know, is is is is it would be premature. Final final thought, he is going to win, isn't he? I mean, is there any chance at all that he doesn't? If if he doesn't, I you know, I'm gonna it's like I've just written a long long article that sort of is is premised on that. So, I'm I'm I'm in some trouble. Okay, you're sticking with it. Uh Eric, really nice to talk to you. Thank you so much for for spending the time with us, Eric Latch from the New York. Thanks. Thanks for having me on. And that's it for today.

"Dozn3v8RyhM","Has President Trump lost patience with Putin as he sanctions Russian oil companies? |BBC Ukrainecast","In the last week, Volodymyr Zelensky failed to secure long-range Tomahawk missiles from Donald Trump during a reportendly heated meeting. Then, a planned summit in Budapest between the US and Russian presidents was called off by Trump who said it would have been a ‘waste of time’.  

But, the White House has now increased the pressure on the Kremlin announcing sanctions on Russia’s two largest oil companies, a first for the Trump administration since his return to office. But will these sanctions be enough to push Putin to the negotiating table? Or will the Kremlin see them as an escalation?   

And as European leaders join Zelensky in insisting that any talks on ending the war in Ukraine should start with freezing the current front line, how should we interpret the Ukrainian leader's language?  

To answer your questions, Lucy and Vitaly are joined by the BBC’s Europe Digital Editor Paul Kirby and senior digital journalist Laura Gozzi. 

The team also discuss the EU’s plan for using frozen Russian assets to help Ukraine and what, if anything, Ukraine is doing to combat propaganda within Russia.

Those Tomahawk missiles that we talked about here last week, they're not going to be going to Ukraine anytime soon after President Zilinsk's frank and apparently very tense meeting with President Trump failed to achieve any breakthroughs. Shortly after we finished recording Tuesday's podcast, we then had news of that much talked about meeting between Presidents Trump and Putin that was due to happen in Budapestt was being called off indefinitely. And then on Wednesday evening, an announcement from the Trump administration. For the first time since he took office, the US announced new sanctions targeting Russia's two largest oil companies in an effort to pressure Moscow to negotiate a deal. He was asked by a reporter why he decided that now was the time. I just felt it was time. We've waited a long time. I thought that we'd go long before the Middle East. Well, I think that in terms of honesty, the only thing I can say is every time I speak with Vladimir, I have good conversations and then uh they don't go anywhere. They just don't go anywhere. As always, plenty of you have been getting in touch with your questions about the war and our team are here to answer them. Hello, I'm Laura Gotia. Hello, I'm Paul Kirby. Hi, I'm Vitali Shvchenko. And I'm Lucy Hawings. Welcome to Ukraine Cast. Ukraine cast from BBC News. We've had lots of great questions from you and we're going to get into them in a moment. But firstly, Vitali, what a week we've had. Russian attacks on Ukraine really seem to have intensified. It's been a brutal week. It certainly has been a brutal week. Uh they're getting worse, especially targeting Ukraine's energy system. It's getting colder. It's getting darker. Russia's using it. But um it's also hitting civilians as well in a village outside Kiev. Um three people were killed in the Russian uh drone strike. uh a mother, her 12year-old daughter, and um a six-month-old girl as well. In in Kharkiv, which is in Ukraine's northeast, um Ukraine's second biggest city, a kindergarten was hit by Russia's shahed drones. Not one, three Shahed drones hit one daycare facility. And those children, they escaped unscathed because they were in a bomb shelter. It's it's grim out there. And just take one example of Lake Cherniv, they've got no electricity at the moment. Yes. The the day before on Monday, there was a massive strike on uh power stations supplying Chernh with electricity. Churnney is a is a fairly large city north of Kiev and yeah completely um blacked out. No power there. And Paul, what's happened with the meeting, the Budapesh meeting that they seem so excited about? Extraordinary. There was a lot of excitement for several days. Um, everyone thought after the 2 and 1/ half hour phone call there was going to be a summit in Budapest. First of all, we were trying to work out how is Putin going to get to Budapest. That was all the interest. Then we suddenly things begin to fall apart rather quickly in a way that they fell apart slowly after the Alaska summit. Uh it turned out that the Russians were going a bit cold on it and uh Lavough was essentially saying well nothing was planned anyway so how can you postpone something that actually hasn't been scheduled and eventually it just began to fall apart and Trump said it was going to be within two weeks and now we don't think it's going to happen at all. And do you think it was frustration around that Laura that led to Trump then saying he's going to slap these sanctions on Russia? Um I think possibly. I mean, I think Trump um Trump has been trying to solve this for some time now. Um I think he's getting increasingly frustrated at how intractable Moscow seems seems to be um on many points around a potential ceasefire or peace deal. And so yes, I think now he's trying to show that um you know him losing patience actually means something actually has real world consequences for Russia. In terms of President Zilinski, he's on a big diplomatic tour this week. He's been in Scandinavia. He's in Brussels coming to London as well. And we've had some questions around some of the language he's been using. And we're going to get to those in a minute. But first, let's talk about these new sanctions from the US. And we've had this question in from Finineian in Liverpool. Hello Ukraine cast. It's Finine from Liverpool. Donald Trump has finally taken some action against Putin as a result of his unwillingness to find a peaceful settlement. How much difference do these additional sanctions really make to Russia both versus what's been imposed previously and versus what more could be directly implemented by the US? Uh yes, these sanctions they are harder biting than most of the others because they target Russia's two biggest oil companies, RSN and Luke Oil. Um they are absolutely huge 3.1 million barrels of oil per day. Now the biggest question I have about this is that whether this is going to change anything actually and this is a question we keep coming back to when it comes to Russia, Ukraine and all the efforts that um America and Europe are taking and the reason why we have to ask this question in this case is because 80% of Russian crude oil is being bought by two countries India and China whether they're going to listen whether they're going to uh take account of these sanctions is another another matter is China going to ignore it in which case they will be pretty much meaningless I mean it does feel Paul like India would take more note than China exactly now as you say India is one of the two big countries India has already had secondary tariffs slapped on them by by Trump so India is sitting up and taking notice and this is probably why the oil price has gone up ever since Trump made this announcement then we have the whole idea of well it's not just the economic impact it's the symbolic impact because it's the first time that Trump has actually done anything in this respect this is the first action direct action he's taken in terms of sec sanctions and it they came from Scott Bessant the treasury secretary but they also came a week after the UK imposed identical sanctions. So it was almost as if the two countries were in lock step and so you begin to think well maybe something has moved on this front. So other things are happening in Russia at the moment and we've had this question in from Melissa in Buffalo New York who says I just heard that Russia is conducting nuclear drills today. Can you describe more about what this might entail? And I think Vitali Melissa asks because every time you hear about anything to do with nuclear it can be very worrying for people. It can be. But we need to remember that this is what Russia does. It rattles its sabers. It shows off its nuclear arsenal. And the the reason why this is happening is because nuclear weapons largely exist not to be used against your enemy in practice, but they're used as a deterrent. The very fact that countries have them is supposed to stop their enemies from taking meaningful action. So this is what happened in in Russia as well. It showed off various videos showing uh missiles being launched from submarines from from the ground and uh uh Vladimir Putin was involved and the message was be afraid. We can use nuclear weapons against you. Whether they will is an entirely different question. Melissa, and we should always remember, Laura, as well, NATO conducts nuclear deterrent exercises as well. Um, yes, absolutely. I mean, it it often does. It's not unusual, but as as Vitalia was pointing out, it's the timing and what you want to read into the timing that is of the essence here. I think so many of you are interested and it's time to get to the ongoing negotiations and the kind of tone that we're hearing as well from President Zilinsky when there's been any shift there, what he's talking to European leaders about as well. But Sasha on Discord has said Trump has had another falling out with President Zilinski last week and now he's talking about freezing the front lines as they are and everyone can just go home. Does anyone really think he's serious when he says that and will it work? The Gaza ceasefire seemed to last 5 minutes before killings started again. Paul, that is the tone that we're getting from President Trump that, you know, everyone can just they just need to agree and everyone can go home. What are we hearing from President Zilinski? Right. So, this I think has been Zilinsk's point all along that we need a ceasefire. The question is really how are you going to bring a ceasefire about? Is it going to be along the line of contact, the front line as existing because that seems to be the only possible way you can have a ceasefire. And I don't I don't think that Zalinski's tone has changed at all over months. I think I think we're we can say that that Zilinski is basically saying this all along. Has it changed, Vitality? I mean, this line of contact phrase, it keeps coming up every day. It does. But when we're talking about ceasefire, we need to remember where else do you cease fire? It's along the line of contact. And President Zalinski, he he was speaking in Sweden yesterday on Wednesday and he specifically said, ""We are prepared to engage in diplomacy, but not at the cost of withdrawing from territories we currently control."" So I don't think he is signaling any readiness to make concessions. However, over the past months, he's been talking about discussing the territorial issue, whether or not it means that Ukraine is now being pressured by its allies to accept relinquishing control of those or acknowledging that Russia is in charge of those territories for some time or forever. That seems to be what's going on. What about the Russian perspective, Laura? because President Zilinski does keep saying that, you know, he's prepared to stop at the current front lines. He said that would be a good compromise, but even he said yesterday, I don't think Putin will accept that. Well, I mean, one of the of the goals of this war, as stated by by Putin and other Kremlin officials over and over, is that, you know, they want to take full control of the two regions um that called collectively are called the Donbass um in eastern Ukraine. Um I mean they even uh annexed them through referendums that weren't really recognized by by um anybody but themselves. But um but the point is that Putin has never backed away from this idea of of of seizing the two regions in full. Now this is a problem for Zilinski because if nothing else I mean thousands of Ukrainian soldiers have fought to protect these regions. So the idea of giving them up is you know is is very problematic and also because Zilinsky has always said you know those are regions that one day if we gave them to Russia Russia could use as a springboard to attack us again. So I mean there's there's such a gulf between Ukraine and Russia on this and many other things that at the moment I mean I'm not surprised that all discussions are focusing on this especially because it's so contentious. We have a great question and actually from Ian as well who is asking about the political capital and how President Zilinski stands in Ukraine right now. Hi Ukraine cast, this is Ian from London. How much political capital does Zinski currently hold in Ukraine? Could he convince Farada to give up any territories as part of a concession for peace? Thank you. President Zilinski still wields a lot of influence in in Ukraine. Um I've looked at the the latest opinion polls and his support rate rating is somewhere in the region of 60% which is more or less unchanged since uh early summer this year. Um, so, uh, when it comes to what he will be able potentially to do to, uh, to give up territory, I think it's a non-starter really. So, first, it's not up to the Rada or the Ukrainian parliament. It's up to the people because any changes to Ukraine's borders will have to put to a referendum. And Ukrainian law says no votes, no referendums can take place as soon as martial law is in place. And also if we think back to to when uh Ukraine was initially attacked by by Russia in 2014 and what happened uh later in 2022 when Ukraine was openly attacked by Russia, it was the Ukrainian people who organized themselves into volunteer battalions to defend their land. So if suddenly Zalinski were to be pressured into giving up territory, would Ukrainians accept it? That's a big question. And also when politicians in in various capitals talk about Ukraine giving up land, people live there. People still live there. So uh those families, they will have they'll be left behind enemy lines. they lose their everything, possibly their lives, given that Russia has shown incredible cruelty in targeting Ukrainians who are still uh present in occupied territories. So the key point here is that when we hear all these suggestions and ideas coming from Washington, European capitals, the 12point plan, none of this is going to work until these uh uh politicians decide what exactly they will be prepared to do to make Russia accept those plans because currently they've not done much to to make the changes. plan at all. And Paul, obviously in Europe, they're worried too that this would set a really dangerous precedent. Of course, and I think Laura mentioned that the fact that they could be used as a springboard if they hand territory to the Russians. But what we were just saying now, this is really interesting, Vitali. It refers back to the previous question as well about territory. And I think Trump has had to find out the hard way from Zalinsky over a period, especially since August, that actually you can't just hand back the territory. Zalinsky has not got that power. He said the other day that uh and and I think he's right that uh 78% of Donetsk region which is the other part of Luhansk in Dubas is pretty much all 99% in Russian hands but 78% he's beginning to understand Trump that this is not something that's negotiable. You can't just hand back 22% the other 22% of Daetsk because there are so many cities, there are so many civilians living there and do you really want to create another humanitarian crisis? Well, we've got a question here about European countries, most of which of course are Ukraine's allies, continuing to boost the Russian economy by buying its gas. And this question comes from Chile from Alejandro. and we think you might be our first Ukraine cast listener, Alejandro, to get in touch with us from Chile. So, thank you so much for writing in. He asks, ""Could the US impose tariffs on individual EU countries for buying Russian goods, or would it have to be on the whole EU block? And are there lawful ways to permanently expropriate frozen Russian assets or otherwise deny future compensation to deter such trade?"" Laura. Um well, this issue is probably being discussed as we speak um in Brussels. Um this idea that um that that European financial institutions hold so much Russian money and that it can't be touched, it's something that European lawmakers have been trying to get around for for quite some time now. So, this system, well, this this proposal that they've um come up with and that they're discussing today basically involves um the EU borrowing the the Russian um money that's being held by a financial institution in Brussels and giving it to Ukraine, but replacing it with a sort of IOU um that would be backed by all member states. Now, Ukraine would be spending that money um now because it needs it badly. it amounts to um 140 billion which would maybe cover its expenses for a couple of years and no more but um that's a problem for the future. Um but in the meantime the idea is that Russia one day if and when the war ends would then be paying Ukraine reparations back and then only at that point would it get its assets back. So it's it's very complex. Um Russia doesn't like this idea at all. um the uh Russian ambassador to Italy um I think uh referred to it as the theft of the century um and and it's being discussed and the European Commission would then have to uh work out the legal framework and it wouldn't come into force until early next year, but it would be pretty momentous because it's not something that's been done before. Um and it's ambitious. It it's contentious. Not everyone's going to like it, but um but we'll see if it if it actually comes about. Laura's had some intense time getting her head around this, Paul. Yes, it's it's an extremely comp complex instrument, but it does feel like most European countries are on board. That's the interesting thing. And by the way, it made us laugh a little bit when the ambassador to Italy came out with that comment in the week of the Louvra theft of 88 million euros worth of uh of jewels. But yes, in terms of getting the European Union to agree, something so contentious as this has been quite something. It's taken months and months and it's this has come to a head right now because countries as as important as Germany have swung behind it. Friedriat the chancellor of Germany very recently decided you know what this is a good idea and we can back it. The most important country of course is Belgium in this instance because this is where the institution that holds the the Russian assets Eurolear is based and if Belgium can be convinced and the door has been pushing that way for a few days it looks as if they are agreeing it then the rest of the European Union um although they have reservations will probably swing past it. We often get questions of course on strategy and Ukrainians right now dealing with the aftermath of uh these strikes as Vitali was saying on some of their key infrastructure particularly when it comes to energy and electricity. Uh Peter has asked us a question now that Ukraine has the Flamingo and Neptune longrange missiles. Why is it not taking out power stations for Moscow and St. Petersburg and other utilities like water? They've done it to Ukraine and much worse. I think there are two possible answers to that question. One is that they can't because Russian air defenses are so good and the other answer is that because they want did they not want to because that would um portray Ukraine in a completely different way uh uh as a country that is prepared to to harm Russian civilians as uh winter approaches. This is what Russia has been criticized for um for for its attacks on Ukrainian energy infrastructure. So for Ukraine to be doing the same thing, that's a political risk. That's so the imperative for Ukraine is to target things that fuel the war machine directly which is uh mostly oil refineries, oil storage facilities and that has been reasonably successful. But I think the oil refineries are also hitting home. Hitting the oil refineries means that civilians are being affected because petrol prices are going up. There are 20% shortages. So those are actually targeting civilians in their own right, even if indirectly. I think another point about the flamingos and the Neptunes is that just maybe they're not ready yet because yes, there's been some talk of of Neptunes being used on short levels, short range, for example, just over the border into Brians and so on. But in terms of closer to St. Petersburg or Moscow, they've been using drones very effectively so far. And maybe they don't want to use the flamingos and Neptu until they're really ready. Paul, I wonder what you think. in terms of the next few days and it's been quite a busy week again for President Zilinsky on the sort of diplomatic tour but then the developments out of the White House with the sanctions the discussion we've had around the narrative but also the language that's being used. Do you think by the end of the weekend things might have actually changed? Will they have moved on? I feel that we've gone around and around in circles and we've done this since August and I don't feel we've got anywhere. Every time somebody suggests something like Trump suggests, we're going to get somewhere, we're going to have talks, and they haven't abandoned the idea of talks, it feels like we just go back into reverse and we end up with nothing. And I remember listening to um a Ukrainian MP just this week saying, ""I don't want to get optimistic because everybody's talking about the possibility that something might move in the right direction in terms of the end of the war."" But the truth is I don't want to get optimistic because I just have a dreadful feeling that it's all going to go back to where we were at the start. I think personally having followed this story for quite some time um I think what's what's really obvious is that um you know there can be so much talk uh talk of talks um talk of sanctions and all the rest of it. But I think what we keep coming up against is um is a very um intractable stance by Moscow. Um, you know, a lot of words are thrown around, but the only messaging that doesn't really change is the Kremlins. You know, they want certain things. They've wanted the same things since the beginning. They've sometimes dressed them up as a bit different, but not really. And so, they've actually been very consistent in their goals and aims and and we keep coming up against the same problem because they just won't budge on that. And I think there is something to to what um Zalinski was saying earlier this week when, you know, he was talking about how Russia won't really engage in diplomacy. He was referring to the issue of front lines especially um and he was like actually the only thing that made Russia pay attention was uh you know the tomahawks the longrange missiles that's when Putin picked up the phone and had this unscheduled um call with Trump last Thursday. So whether this message is something that's beginning to trickle through. There's no tomahawks. No, there's no tomahawks. But you know there might be something else down the line or not, I'm sure that whatever does come about will be preceded by weeks of back and forth. Um, again, and we will be here for all of those questions. Thank you all very much and thank you for watching. We will have another Q&A episode next week.

The advert, which is sponsored by the government of Canada's Ontario province, quotes the former President Ronald Reagan saying that tariffs hurt every American. President Trump wrote on social media the advert was fake, adding that trade talks were hereby terminated. Well, there's a little bit of that ad that so enraged the president. But over the long run, such trade barriers hurt every American worker and consumer. High tariffs inevitably lead to retaliation by foreign countries and the triggering of fierce trade wars. Then the worst happens. Well, Canada's Prime Minister Mark Carney told reporters about a couple of hours ago his country is prepared to continue trade talks when the Americans are ready to actually return to discussions. We can't control the trade policy of the United States. We recognize that that policy has fundamentally changed from the policy in the 1980s, 1990s, 2000s. Um, and it's a situation where the United States has tariffs against every one of their trading partners to different degrees. And it's in that context that our officials, my colleagues have been working uh with their American colleagues on detailed, constructive uh negotiations, discussions on specific transactions, specific sectors, steel, aluminum uh and energy. And a lot of progress has been made and we stand ready uh to pick up on that progress uh and build on that progress uh when the Americans are ready to have those discussions because it will be for the benefit of workers in the United States, workers in Canada's uh and families in both of our countries. Well, that was Mark Carney. Jars Gearton is the president and CEO of the Toronto Regional Board of Trade. I spoke to him earlier and he gave me his reaction to the breakdown of these trade talks. We've had months of hard work and and good faith negotiations as you heard Prime Minister Cardi mention um and and it appeared that we were on the cusp of at least a partial um set of arrangements around some critical sectors steel um aluminum and um and energy uh with the rest of still to come. we were hoping. Um so to see the progress stall out at this stage uh and this is not the first kind of termination that we've had uh but to see it stall out at this stage is is is quite frustrating. Yes, we sh will see if it's a short-term political tantrum or a long-term position if it is the latter. Take me through the consequences of not making progress on these key areas. Well, you know, um we've had tariffs now in place for for quite a few months. uh and and and and we're being treated like every other country. As Prime Minister Carney said, the problem for us is that we have a deeply integrated economy with the United States and Ontario in particular, large manufacturing economy and it's tied directly into the US manufacturing economy. Supply chains are deeply integrated and that's taken place over uh the last 40 years. And ironically, talking about President Reagan, it was under President Reagan that the free trade deal, the first free trade deal with Canada was negotiated. I was a young reporter in Washington when that deal was negotiated. And we remember President Reagan as being, you know, a free trader. And um and so and so this disrupting and and trying to unravel these these this deeply integrated economy and supply chains is is is very costly. And so we're starting to see the costs in Ontario. We're seeing our steel industry has lost half of its export market um literally in the last several months. Our auto industry is is facing uh significant trade constraints and and loss of sales and investment. Uh we just seen a major uh auto plant in Ontario uh where the the prospective model vehicle that was going to be produced there has been plucked out of that plant to be put into a US plant uh in order to satisfy uh you know the the requirements US. So, so this is having significant repercussions. I will say that our understanding is that what we're hearing from our our members to the board of trade, our manufacturing members, is that their US counterparts in Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania are also feeling the brunt of tariffs as else."

Hang. Whoa. Who's it's Pudsy Bear from Children in Need. Hello, Pudsy. Have a seat. Come and analyze this week's news if you want. What's this? Is that an envelope you've got that says Pudsy challenges you? Also, you're trashing the place. I'm not. Your challenge is to stop trashing a studio, right? What does it say in here? for BBC Children in Need. Challenge yourself to 25. Your challenge is to record a 25-hour episode of newscasts. Do you know what? I think I could probably do that. Challenge accepted. Thank you, Pudsy. Hello, it's Adam in the newscast studio. And just to say, we are recording this episode of the podcast at 7:30 on Thursday evening. And it's Chris in the studio and it's Alex in the studio and it's also Joe Pike in the studio. Chris, a few moments ago, we had a proper celebrity sat in that chair. Did you? Pudsy Bear from Wow, that is a celebrity. Yeah. And he handed me an envelope with a challenge in it, which we're all now part of. Sorry to break this news to you. Well, having heard about, you know, Sarah Cox's challenge of having to cycle halfway across the UK and everything's around the number 25, right? Yeah. Yeah. I'm just thinking, what on earth have we been signed up to? It's a test of endurance built around the number 25, but it is something that we'll be better at than say running a lot or drumming a lot or dancing a lot. Go on. We're doing a 25hour long episode of newscast. What? Wow. What? Which will be live streamed on BBC Sounds and I player on Thursday the 13th of November starting at 8:00 a.m. and finishing at 9:00 a.m. the next day. I don't know why I'm laughing. You're going all the way through. All the way through, apart from loot breaks, which will not be live streamed. Oh, so you are doing lube breaks. Not it's not like uh senators. That's what I do. I don't 25 hours without one. Well, Cory Booker 25 hours in the US Senate in April this year standing up. No food, no lube breaks. There's your Okay. Well, I'll start training my bladder. Anyway, last time we saw each other amazingly was just before you went to India with Kier Starmer. How did that trip go? Yeah, it was really interesting. I think the takeaway because it was one of those really quick flying literally visits to Mumbai which was about effectively celebrating the trade deal they had signed but the notable thing from a sort of political watches perspective was how much there was like real welcoming for Kiama there like there were these massive cutouts like life-size Kiaas everywhere in Mumbai like you drive down the road there were 5,700 posters of Kama and Narendra Modi put up around Mumbai just for this visit it was like this huge welcome And it was like the contrast between the prime minister on the foreign stage where he increasingly looks pretty comfortable and people say he's doing pretty well and then like that kind of domestic return where he's facing a lot of problems to you know I must admit that weekend after you got back I turned on any questions. I it's quite close to my heart, but I turned on to just work out if like halfway through I was going to hear the sound of Alex's head hitting the desk because you another endurance test what 5 in the morning and then went to York and then let's talk about domestic politics which you've not been doing much of for the previous days because you've been in India. That's it. Yeah. Well then a very neat segue Joe for about the last 172 hours you've been tallying up politicians calling for action on Prince Andrew. Yes. Where would you say the tally has got to? And I don't you don't need to give me a precise number. Just I think I think we're probably at a stage where there needs to be some sort of action. Certainly uh various politicians from different parties are calling for the legal removal of titles for uh select committees to bring Prince Andrew before them uh for him to disappear from public life altogether which is what Robert Gri suggested earlier this week. But the fact that there is this sort of increasing volume and increasing boldness in political interventions on the royalty is pretty unprecedented. And I'm sure those in the past are trying to work out how you how you there's just like there's open just tipping skip loads of approprium uh the best way of describing it over his head, aren't they really? you know, that kind of real sense of open public anger that this has gone on for too long and is unsustainable. And the Royal Lodge element of it, I think, unlike other parts of this story, is so easy for everyone to understand. He's somebody who is not good enough to be part of sort of royal life. He's been sidelined. He's being punished. And yet he can live in this beautiful 30 although he would saysion he's got a legal contract with the crown estate that they negotiated in 2003 and that he paid loads of money to refurbish that building in lie of rent. Absolutely. He would argue he's it's not very easy to get to get get him out of it. And of course he's denied wrongdoing and he's never been charged or convicted of anything at all. And yet it's such a a visual easy to understand because you hear the word lodge and you you you half think of some sort of wooden hut somewhere in a forest Gretle and then you see that and then you see those sort of helicopter shots of what is sort of mansion 30 rooms not 30 bedrooms. So I sound like I'm Prince Andrew's spokesman say it's only 30 rooms it's not 30 bedrooms only 30 rooms. Isn't the bigger problem that this whole issue about Royal Lodge and about titles has suddenly made everybody far more interested in the detail here, including the detail of royal finances. There's one thing we've known over decades the palace does not like is people looking into that detail and now we've got select committees looking at some of the details around a royal the very financial architecture that sustains the whole edifice is now is now a topic of public conversation because of Prince Andrew but what it's also done is shone a light on the relationship between parliament government and the royals because you know there has been and even there was a bit of misunderstanding kicking around the houses of commons this week about whether MPs and what they could raise about the royals in the commons, you know, cuz there isn't a blanket ban. But that a lot of people seem to think that there was that they couldn't criticize the royals in the commons and then there had to be this kind of like clarification from the speaker saying no actually you can. It's just that you can't basically chuck it into the mix whenever you fancy. There's got to be some sort of proper process around it. But you absolutely can. But, you know, I think I think there are sort of really legitimate questions to ask about how much oversight, how much involvement the government and parliament should have when it comes to the royals, particularly when there's public money involved, which of course there is when it comes to the clown. What people would really like to know is how Prince Andrew finances his life now and who provides that money, whether it's himself, his family, associates, business contacts. But here's the conundrum. He stepped away from public duties several years ago. So actually could probably argue no one has a right to know about that because actually that's nothing to do with public money. He's just he's just a person that people are interested in. And this was the third intervention of the royal family on Prince Andrew. So after news night interview 2019, you had that initial stage which was stepping aside from um royal duty. Yeah. at the time that I remember it. It felt like the nuclear option like wow this is like unprecedented in modern times but it turns out but then he didn't vanish. Yeah entirely. And step two was 2022. So that was around that civil case in America involving Virginia Grey. That's when the raw patronages and military titles came into it. Last Friday was step three which is around of course the publication of Virginia Jafrey's postumous memoir but also these emails which look like Prince Andrew has either been confused or lied about his last contacts postconviction with Jeffrey Epstein and also the Royal Lodge and it doesn't look like that step three and that step three in what six years was enough because that step was not using these titles but not actually legally removing any of them. So there are many more steps that the royal family could still go on. Just an observation about this most recent step that you were mentioning, Joe, which is without knowing specifically the individual motivations around particular sources deciding to talk to journalists or act in a particular way, there's been enough chains of events in recent days to point towards an element of the sort of dam breaking around um a a sense within wider royal circles that the current position is not sustainable. Um and you know the speed with which the freedom of information request that the times made around the whole business of the the lease on Royal Lodge and the peppercorn rent they now there can be multiple reasons why something like that might be answered either slowly or quickly but the speed with which it was answered without question was another set of headlines that were difficult for him to to to deal with some of the stuff that the Mail on Sunday was reporting at the weekend around um his conversations with his police protection team way back in 200 1. Again, that being something that becomes public knowledge right now as opposed to at any time in the previous 14 years. Different subject, the national statutory inquiry into child grooming gangs. Before we talk about the the chaos that's happened this week, Alex, we should probably just go through all the steps that it took to actually get to there being an inquiry at all. Yeah. And it has been quite a long process, wasn't it, right at the beginning of the year? I mean, yes, absolutely decades. But I think this latest stage if you want to view it that way, it kind of erupted at the beginning of this year actually and it was this sudden resurgence in the demands for a national inquiry to look into this issue which has seen so many mostly but not exclusively women completely failed by the authorities that were meant to protect them and subject to the most horrendous experiences. There was this kind of call. Kistama initially resisted it on the basis that there had been previous inquiries and he was saying that the focus should be on implementing the recommendations of previous more wide ranging inquiries about child sexual abuse and exploitation eventually. Then he commissioned Louise Casey who is his kind of go-to troubleshooter for things across Whiteall to do a sort of short sharp review of the grooming gangs issue in particular and then her recommendation was that there should be a public inquiry. So that was announced and then we are now embroiled in this kind of turmoil around the process of setting up that inquiry. And part of the setting up process, Chris, was this panel of victims and survivors who were in conversation with the government about a what this national inquiry should actually cover and b who should be the inquirer and chief? Who should chair it completely? And and what you have from the government's perspective and indeed all of those involved really is like a 360 degree headache. So on the on the subject of the chair, how do you find someone who wants to do it and is seen to be credible by the widest number of people? And there's an acceptance in government that a finding somebody who wants to do it and will stick the course will not be easy. And then B, whoever you do find will not be universally welcomed. So some ministers were really keen on this guy Jim Gamble who used to be to give you a sense of his biography he used to be in policing in Northern Ireland during the troubles and then spent years helping the victims of child exploitation. So two jobs that you couldn't exactly describe as being straightforward and yet he did not fancy taking on this job and talked publicly about how he felt how politicized the whole process had become etc etc. So now the government is acknowledging it's going to take months for them to find a chair. They're desperate to find someone who Oh, so that could be next year. Yeah. Yeah. And they're desperate to find someone who will stay the course. Then separate to that, but it overlaps in terms of the awkwardness is the views that some of the uh victims who've been involved in the and consulted in the setting up of this process have about Jess Phillips, the safeguarding minister. So some who have gone public and said they only want to be a part of this if she goes and then others who went public saying they only want to be a part of this if she stays. So another impossible bind. Now Jess Phillips is not going anywhere. She is supported in the home office and in the safeguarding minister she is staying in her post. Um, so I mean, yeah, what a what a mess. And this is just setting it up, let alone it running its course, it coming to conclusions and the conclusions being acted upon, which is the whole point. And also if you remember what Baroness Casey actually suggested, it wasn't some giant inquiry like the inquiry into infected blood or bloody Sunday where you looked at loads of bits of it was more like an inquiry that could go into particular areas and conduct inquiries that local authorities couldn't do themselves. It was more like a sort of like like a sort of hit squad as opposed to a big giant kind of machine. Let's listen to a bit of Jess Phillips, the safeguarding minister in the House of Commons, and then we'll talk about why why this has become quite controversial. Allegations of intentional de delay, lack of interest or widening of the inquiry scope uh and dilution are false. And Joe, it's those two words, allegation and false, that really riled some of the people that she's supposedly meant to be working with. Yeah. and one of them has has accused Jess Phillips of lying because it seems in the process of consultation around this from a body separate to the government um some survivors have been asked a series of questions including a about the a breadth of this inquiry even though the government are very clear it will be purely focused on on grooming gangs this has been completely chaotic really the government have ultimately failed at the first stage. This has all fallen apart. But I do think what they said about the time scale now is is what is probably necessary. They sort of the pressure valve needs to be used here to say it it'll take months to sort of lower expectations to calm things down and then once people are feeling calmer to try and work out if there's a way forward. I think the the reason that the reaction to what Jess Phillips said there about the false allegations clearly had such resonance not in a good way for some of the survivors was that they were saying that for a long time what they felt was that they hadn't been believed or heard by the authorities. So then to have the perspective that they were putting forward dismissed as a false allegation only exacerbated that view because you have to remember when I say mostly women of course they were girls they were children a lot of them at the time and then when they did find the courage to speak up or speak out then they weren't kind of listened to. So it's clearly and and and that speaks to why this is just so difficult because there are those survivors who feel that way very strongly that Jessip shouldn't be apart. There are those who really do want her to stay, but of course here these are people that you can totally understand and I don't want to speak for them, but you can just you can't even imagine some of the experiences they had. And to be able to trust anybody in a position of authority after that experience that must be quite a fragile thing and I think that is why for the government clearly they're now finding this position like although I was quite struck by by Jim Gamble's um statements. to the guy who pulled out from being being the potential chair and he had like quite harsh words for all politicians in all directions for politicizing this. Of course, that's what politicians do. They make political arguments about issues. But he was saying there is a parallel universe where there was some cross party consensus that took some of the political heat out of this and did this in a much more constructive way. Yeah, I think there is that parallel universe. Although I'm I'm not sure that was ever realistic. That's the point of parallel universe. Well, indeed. The other thing is, you know, there's there there were 30 people, I'm told, on this panel. There's fewer than that now because some have stood stood down. They are clearly of different views and instincts. They're on different views and instincts about whether speaking out is a good idea, whether it is either right to do that or wrong to do that. There are different views about the scope and breadth of the inquiry, different views about who might be an appropriate person to chair it, and whether their own biography. In other words, if they've worked in a sector that some would regard as deeply tainted by all of this, that should exclude them. But then someone was saying to me today, look that there will there isn't a clean skin out there. If you're going to find somebody who has the credibility to take this on, they are likely to be from a sector, whether it be the judiciary. The government doesn't want to go down that route, but the conservatives have made that argument. or social care or the policing or policing you know the likely areas where someone's CV would match up to the challenge of this is also likely to overlap with a sector that is likely to be heavily scrutinized and criticized in this process and that how do you find a way through that that is a path of least disruption anger um uh sense of let down when when as you say at the heart of this as Alex says You have people who have been profoundly and repeatedly let down by the state. So of of course they will very easily be skeptical about any sense that another arm of the state is somehow not handling this properly. Right. The one in oneout deal. So by which somebody who crosses the English Channel in a small boat gets returned back to France and in return the UK takes somebody officially and processes them for asylum here or reunites them with a family member here. has now become the one in one out, one back again and eventually out again. Has it? Yeah. Well, yeah. Which is not as catchy as the first version. No. Yeah. In one case. That's right. There was this situation that developed this week where somebody who had been sent back to France under the one in went out scheme then got on a small boat and returned back to the UK again. Uh which you know, you got to be blunt about it. Clearly the government did point to this scheme as yes, one of the things that it's doing because it's consistently said it doesn't believe there's a silver bullet when it comes to tackling this issue. But nonetheless, one of the key things that they thought might make a difference because they hoped ultimately it would act as a deterrent. I.e. people in Calala would hear that they might be sent back if they'd made that small boat crossing and therefore they wouldn't make the small boat crossing in the first place. Well, this person decided they were going to do it twice. So you that does obviously pose a question for the government about the effectiveness of that scheme as a deterrent. Now Karma has been pretty clear in saying we know who this person is. We're going to make sure that they're sent back very quickly. But I do think obviously it's going to lead to questions for the government about this. Here Kier Star saying that in his own words in relation to the uh person who's returned. Obviously what we've now got is all of his details in the system. At the moment he's shown up. He's already been detained and he will now be fasttracked back to France. So trying to get back here has been completely pointless um because he's already in the system. We know who he is. We've got him and we're going to get him back out the country very very quickly. But I suppose if this person does get sent back, I mean does that still provide the deterrent effect? Because the net result is still that if you cross English Channel in a small boat, there's a chance you might get sent back. Well, I mean, firstly, there's the if, isn't there? So, what process happens between now and them definitely being back in France. The argument those in government make, they accept this as embarrassing. But the argument they make is that up to a point the process worked in that they had this person's biometrics from their first attempt and therefore when they made a second attempt, it was immediately flagged that they'd been around the block before uh around all of this. But I mean I'm really struck again not least because also happening this week is this whole business where the numbers crossing in small boats so far this calendar year has now hit the same number as the total calendar year of last year and is on trend to be similar to the highest year ever which was back in 2022 of about 45,000 uh from from memory is that the language that the home office is still using is the language of opposition politicians. They're saying the numbers are shameful and they're the ones in government which again speaks to this whole sequence of things they are trying to do. No one silver bullet but they're attempting to line up all of these measures that they hope in time will make a difference whilst acknowledging that as someone said to me recently about all of this. We're scaling up but the problems scaling up faster than we are. And therefore the the the numbers the numbers are still bleak. And that thought that you could get to a point even in a couple of years where maybe some of these ideas that they've got do start making a difference. But if the numbers attempting to cross continues to grow, the number might not slow down or it might it might slow down relative to where it would have been, but the graph will still be pointing upwards and it could be it could be working but getting worse. Yeah, exactly. It'll just look like failure still even if it's being successful up to a point. I mean, I'm ashamed to admit I hadn't quite clocked when the one in oneout deal was being negotiated and then put in place. It's like, well, of course, France can't lock up asylum seekers because we don't lock up asylum seekers. That's why you get put in a in a hotel or an HMO or a flat is because when you're in the asylum system, you are free to move around. You don't get detained. And so, of course, that means people in France are free to go and try again. But what was the what was the plan? What was the government's intention for these people to do after they got back to, I don't know, Paris airport or wherever? Well, in theory, you need the French asylum system to work super super quickly. Grant that person asylum in France or repatriate them back to a third country but instantly and but therefore expect them to be able to do something that that we struggle with the UK is struggling with. And also if just in this the sort of personal psychology of it, if you have spent probably a lot of money, time and put yourself in a really dangerous situation to come maybe cross half the world to go to northern France to take one last dangerous trip. Like why would going back to France mean that you wouldn't try and do that final section again and go back to back to square one? It just there isn't necessarily a huge amount of logic to it. And also you've got this question which can be bait has posed. Does the person going back a second time being deported a second time? Does that count as one of the French one in one out? It's not clear what happens there. But I would say that's part of the the sort of but that's the system. I mean I think that's the key thing was that effectively this scheme was meant to be a deterrent. It questions whether or not it actually is a deterrent. And a lot of people did say for it to be an effective deterrent. People that really understand what's going on it will have to scale up quite significantly. And even though the government insisted it was just a pilot scheme in the first instance and that it was going to scale up, I I think we still don't know whether they have, you know, actually had an agreement in France with France that this is going to be a really kind of substantial scheme where loads of people are going to be set up. And I suppose in time that the extent to which it is a deterrent be determined by two factors, won't it? One, the the the number and how high how much scaling up can happen. And then secondly, the proportion who who end up having another go. In other words, for whom it has clearly not been a deterrent. And the proportion of people who decide partly maybe because of the deterrent they hear and see with these leaflets in in Northern France. Oh, actually I'm going to go through the legal route apply to be part of the other part of the one out scheme, not take the dangerous journey. But of course that is numbers and that's back to scaling up again because if that number's big, the other number's big and therefore it's a greater likelihood that that's a viable option. Just a little sidebar issue, but that clip of Kier Sarmmer that we played a minute ago was an interview with our colleague Zoe Kleimman, who's the technology editor, where Karma was talking about ID cards. So, they're back on the agenda, having appeared on the agenda, then disappeared, but now they're back. But also, it was interesting that he was talking to Zoe because he obviously wanted to talk about it from like a tech point of view completely. and I wanted to have another go at trying to sell them. I think because when he did it initially, it was wrapped up in well, firstly there was a bit of briefing to try and sort of knock the Andy Burnham leadership story off the off the top of the news bulletins just before Labour. Could you buy a boat? Well, yeah. The first time he's had a few bites of this cherry. Yeah. The first time he mentioned it out loud was talking to me by a I must say a ship because I was told off for calling it a boat. Uh, so I just uh, you know, I don't want to get you into trouble with our boys and girls in in the Navy. Um, yes, we were on the banks of the Clyde talking and but I spent most of the interview talking about Angela Raina because that was the story at the time who's also back. Yeah. Yeah. And and then he mentioned I I asked him about ID and then he I was like, ""Oh, that's interesting. On any other day I' I'd make a whole thing about that."" And then we barely covered it because we were all obsessing about Angela Raina. So that really didn't get much of an outing. And then he had another go three weeks later and then there was Andy Burnham and then he started dropping it into a speech where he was talking about the future of the left on the global stage and blah blah blah. And I think he wanted to have a clean go at talking about what he sees as the merits knowing that there's been what three million people now signing a petition on parliament's website thinking it's a terrible idea. Just as an aside, during the trip to India, he actually met the man who was the architect of India's digital IT system which was introduced and scaled up rapidly to 1.2 billion people. Yeah, it's a 12-digit number which means you now people most people use it to access most public services. I think you can even use it for sort of payments and things like it's become this really extensive thing but it isn't without controversy at all. Things around data sharing, things around people that might have been excluded from that. And it was interesting that Kalma met him to discuss and Downing Street was saying look it doesn't mean we're going to copy the model very different parameters in the UK but still fascinating he met him and then interestingly the kind of shift from Downing Street at that point where it was as opposed to initially when this was first announced it was very much this is to tackle illegal working and it's a part of our efforts to tackle people coming to the UK to stop illegal trying to sell the wider benefits as they would see it about improving access to public services reducing the FAF I think he said today. Yeah. And I think there's been a really notable shift in the approach from Downing Street on this where they think that they do need to make a broader argument like a consumer argument almost, you know. Um I've lost track of the Labour deputy leadership contest. Have Have the ballots closed? Is it? They have. So Thursday closed announcement Saturday. Yeah. Saturday morning. Um uh it's a big snazzy event. No. No. It's the opposite. It's like a it's like could have been an email. like a fire blanket just being thrown over it in the in hope of boring everyone to pretending it's not really happening. is basically do do you think and for that reason I'm covering it cuz I'm like I'm covering it right but there's no there's you know there's no there isn't a we're not we're not being invited into a room as as reporters to sit there and then watch some returning officer come out and say I hereby declutter the might the whole thing might be like on zoom you know they don't see anything in it for them for making a big deal out of it because the whole nature of the deputy leadership role whoever it is but particularly if it's Lucy Pal which is widely expected is to be that kind of sort of depending on how you decide decide to do the job that kind of rain check on the leadership or that counter to the leadership or that voice for the members in you know into the into the leadership and you know yeah they don't want to make a fuss about it right lovely to see you all pleasure as ever and look forward to your thrilling Saturday morning Chris will be tuning in it's going to be great you've really s I know how to live at the weekend if only it was happening in the middle of a hour long live podcast. We can take the result in minute detail down to 57 decimal points just exactly. And that would just leave you with 24 and a half hours to go. Exactly. Anyway, that's it for this episode of Newscast.

"vjoA4tOSpik","Is climate change to blame for rise in South Korea fishermen deaths? | BBC News","In South Korea, there’s been a drastic spike in the number of fishermen being killed at sea.
 
Last year more than a hundred died after their boats capsized or sank.
 
The government has investigated, and it has pinpointed climate change as one of the main causes, alongside other factors, like the country’s ageing workforce.
 
The waters around Korea are warming far faster than the global average. This is causing fish to migrate - forcing fishermen to travel further and take bigger risks to catch enough.

Photographs released by Gaza's medical authorities show some of the bodies badly decomposed, and arriving in civilian clothes or naked except for underwear, some with multiple signs of injury. Many have their wrists tied behind their backs, and doctors say some bodies arrived blindfolded or with cloth roped around their necks.
 
The forensic team at Nasser Hospital are working with almost no resources to answer vast questions about torture, mistreatment and identity - and a lack of cold storage space.

Israel's army has repeated that it acts in accordance with international law. Almost 200 bodies have been returned to Gaza in return for Hamas handing over the bodies of 13 Israeli hostages. Earlier this week, Gaza buried dozens of remains before they were identified because of a lack of facilities to hold them. Our Middle East correspondent, Lucy Williamson, has been speaking to doctors, officials, and forensic experts about the challenge of confirming the stories of the dead, bodies without names, buried by families without relatives. at a funeral without closure. A mass burial for 54 bodies sent back by Israel, unidentified and unclaimed. In a place without autopsies or DNA tests, the dignity of a flag marks out the hearse. Families of those missing in the war gathered here, unsure if they were burying a stranger or their nephew, brother, or son. We are looking for my sister's son. Every day I go with her to try to identify the body, but there's nothing to indicate if it's him. If there was DNA testing, we'd know. Only some 50 of the almost 200 bodies brought to Gaza's NASA hospital during the ceasefire have been identified. Unable to carry out postmortems or DNA tests, doctors this week asked families to spot their relatives among the dead. Many naked, decomposed, and bearing marks that the forensic unit says are signs of torture. When a person is found naked with hands tied behind their back and visible restraint marks on the wrists and ankles, it indicates that they died in that position. Likewise, the multiple injuries, bruises, and marks found across the bodies were blindfolded with bindings around the neck. Some of these photographs show deep indentations and cable ties around the limbs along with other injuries. But establishing what happened to these bodies before they died and whether injuries are due to combat or abuse isn't always easy. We showed these photographs to several forensic specialists who said they raised questions that were difficult to answer without postmortems. Human rights groups and whistleblowers have told us that detainees held without charge in Israeli jails were heavily restrained, especially at the start of the war. Detainees from Gaza were held when they were restrained and cuffed and their eyes were covered the whole time 24 hours, 7 days a week for months. People developed serious infections on their skin, on their hands, on their legs because of the cuffs. Israel's army told us all the bodies returned to Gaza so far were fighters and denied tying any bodies before release. Israel, of course, adheres to all international law when it comes to any actions inside of the Gaza Strip. These types of reports that come out, it's just more evidence and more efforts to demonize Israel. Gaza's forensic team told us that Israel had provided ID numbers for six of the bodies, five of which proved to be wrong. The war here may have stopped, but for Gaza's forensic doctors, a new battle for the truth has begun. Lucy Williamson, BBC News, Jerusalem."

So, Terry Rosie, you mentioned there from the Miami Miami Heat. So when you look at the indictment, he's accused of participating in an illegal sports betting scheme uh using insider NBA information. So for people who might not know much about Terry Rosio, he was averaging nearly 21 points per game for the Charlotte Hornet. During a game against the New Orleans Pelicans, he scored only five and played less than 10 minutes before claiming he was hurt. This is the allegation. The injury, according to the indictment, it was fake. And that fix was part of a scheme to help sports betters. The allegation is that you can bet the guy who usually schools height may not.

He has to get a royal lodge. He has to lock the doors and he has to go. Should the government step in and what can they realistically do? Nadine, the government should not step in. They shouldn't go anywhere near it. It's um it's that would set a precedent. You know, he's one bad apple in we should be very grateful for our royal family for all that they do, all the revenue they bring into the UK, for what they do for us globally on so many levels. But Prince Andrew is about Apple. And you know, I'm a mother of three grown-up daughters, and I know that if I'd behaved in the way that Prince Andrew even begins to behave, they would be making an intervention. And I really feel sorry for Beatric and Eugenei because they're being bismerched by this. And we've seen our royal family diminish through death and illness in recent years. And they could be playing a very active role, but of course they can't because of their father. And if I were Beatric Eene, I know this my girls, they'd be sitting him down and saying, ""Pack your bags, get out, go and live somewhere else. Go and live in a different country. You It's over."" But the problem is Prince Andrew doesn't seem to realize it is over. what he's done in the past through his relationship with with Epstein has been not just unbelievable but untenable in his position as a member of the royal family. He has to go. He has to pack his bags. He has to get a royal lodge. He has to lock the doors and he has to go. And the sooner he does it, the better. And I think the only people who can make him realize that are his own family and his own daughters because he doesn't seem to be listening to anybody else. I should point out, of course, given that Prince Andrew is not here. He's Well, we've never asked him to come on the panel. I'm not sure he would, but um he is not here to defend himself. He has vigorously denied the allegations made by Virginia Duke of course uh that that he well effectively that he had sex with her that he he's sexually assaulted. He is I have to say that, you know, I do the point. The point is it's a point of law that I have to point that out. But the point is he's absolutely blackened the name of the royal family. While the king is over in Rome at the moment meeting the pope, while the king is trying in the post the death of the queen to establish a new monarchy and modernizing the monarchy, it's been absolutely dominated by Prince Andrew. Okay. He he just has to go. We certainly had a lot of questions on it tonight, which is why we're doing it. Yes, the man there in in the dark glasses. Yeah, in the blue sweater. Uh, should Prince Andrew not be exiled, face crimes? Right. What? Chucked out of the country altogether? Yes. Any idea? Any any idea where you think you should go? Okay. Very distracted. Yeah. The man at the very back with the with the the cap. There you go. Baseball. I'm actually quite shocked. I'm actually agreeing with you, Nadine, today. Anyway, well, you're saying you're shocked. You agree with it? Yes. Okay. Talk to me some more. You'll find there's loads. Oh, I don't know. Um I I think he's an embarrassment to this country and he really needs the taxpayers actually paying for him to live in an accommodation and it's just disgraceful. What about the man there in the glasses and the black t-shirt towards the bank? Um yeah, I think there's a bit of a danger in referring to Prince Andrew as a bad apple. um thinking that once if you know if it if it does if it is true and once he's removed then the whole problem's over with this this was like a a highly organized horrific thing I mean who else was involved and what sort of what sort of systems what sort of environment is put in place where these people were abused in was talking about the royal family I was briefing the bad happened in the royal family in the context of just the royal family you're absolutely right in wider scheme of things. Yeah, there are there are many questions to be answered. So just putting another point of view, Mariela, for the sake of argument, I mean, is there any sense, do you think? I mean, Prince Andrew, he's he's no longer getting income from the royal family. He may have a private income or inheritance that we don't know about. He gets no income from the royal family. He has no title anymore. Um, he's effectively a pariah. I think it's it's fair to say. Well, I certainly don't have sympathy for him. I mean, I think that he's he's dealt with this in a in a particularly clumsy and entitled way, but I'll maybe come back to entitled in a minute. You know, I mean, I don't think he's been properly um apologetic to the victims. I don't think he's taken it seriously enough. Um the fact that he behaves in an entitled way, I find it ironic that that term is bandied around because he is entitled. The royal family are entitled. They're entitled to inherit this position at the sort of pinnacle of British so society. I think Prince Andrew I I also find myself curiously agreeing with Nadine in that I think he should go and live in some nice you know Swiss ski resort with his creepy friends, his creepy rich friends and you know live out his life the way he clearly enjoys it. Um, but I think that there's big questions that we should be asking about the place of the monarchy in our society at the moment. You know, we have this constitutional monarchy which is in many ways at odds, I would say, with the parliamentary system and the democratic system. We have I think that the royal family are incredible. I think that the king with all of his organic and environmental work and the queen with all her work around literacy and I read an amazing article the other day because Sophie the Countess of Wessix had gone to the DRC and taken this very dangerous trip to highlight the Democratic Republic of Congo to highlight the issues particularly women were facing there and so I think that they do great work but do you know there's there's absolutely no transparency when it comes to finances um We scrutinize them to with an inch of their lives because of the fact that we pay such huge amounts of money for them to continue to live in the way that they do. And I think that's what we should be asking questions about at the moment. Clearly, Prince Andrew is is is, you know, has has has has, you know, dirtied his hands in something that is totally abhorrent. And I find it really also um you know very difficult to comprehend why what was clearly a grooming gang of rich powerful men. The only people who have been very clear um you know well one's been a recipient of justice in terms of Gileain Maxwell for for her role in it. One woman and another woman Virginia Gifrey you know has has committed suicide as a result of her experiences. Where are the men? You know, where are the guys that were involved with this? It's not just Prince Andrew. And I think so Harriet, should the government step in and what can they realistically do? So, so just to to fill everybody in, the government has said they'll not be making time for MPs to debate Prince Andrew in the Commons. And actually, there's all sorts of difficulties about debating the royals in the Commons. You can maybe come on to that, but the public accounts committee is going to look into the lease arrangements for Royal Lodge. So, they're going to have an investigation into that and that has been supported by the government. Is this I mean there's lots of things the government should be doing. Is this something the government should be doing? Well, I think these allegations are horrendous and I think that uh the stain, the blot that they have created. Um particularly I I thought serious last weekend was the allegation uh that Prince Andrew had asked the Met Police through his security detail to do some background uh investigations into uh Virginia Jafrey. And I think if that proves to be the the the case through these investigations that the Met are currently doing, uh I think that's an incredibly serious situation. You're absolutely right that um parliament itself and obviously I'm an opposition MP. I can't speak for the government, but I think Parliament does have the ability to scrutinize these uh types of issues. uh and I think that uh the government itself um has got the power to to to provide time to parliament in in government time um to debate them. But I think that the allegations are incredibly serious. Particularly that one uh last weekend I thought was really, you know, just so shocking in terms of uh of investigating um her um that I think this story will continue. And to to Mariela's point, I think I am passionate monarchist. I think we have been incredibly blessed to have a constitutional monarchy and I'm a huge huge supporter of the royal family and that's why I think this is such a serious situation because clearly the the the great work that our royal family uh do and as Mariela was was outlining some of those examples um it is um affected by the media coverage that we're getting all the time about these but they could do great without us being Prince Andrew they could do those good works without us being a constitutional monarchy with completely, you know, opaque finances. You know, part of the reason we can't investigate royal lodge and so on is because there is no transparency with the with with an awful lot of the money that goes to the royal family. I'm not saying they shouldn't. I I absolutely, as I said, you know, they do great work, but maybe we should reook at our relationship with them, but this is why it's so serious because people who are Republicans, I'm not a Republican. No, I'm saying I'm not I'm not sure including you in that, Mariel, but I'm saying there are people who are Republicans. You know, they are using they are using this as a way to get at the royal family and that's terrible. Men there in the in the jacket and tie. Thank you. Um I think if Prince Andrew wishes to do the honorable thing and leave the country with his family, there may be a couple of spare bedrooms in Monteito with Harry and Megan. You're thinking, of course. Yes. uh man here. I think it has to start somewhere, right? It's it's there's this shroud of secrecy across the whole thing and some, you know, if we make an example of him, then maybe the rest of the world will follow. We've got the Epstein vials and all of these other things and they just work in the shadows. So, by making an example of him, I think that'd be a really good start. But is this is this something you think the government should be doing or you think the royal family should be doing it? A brave stance. Yeah. But what could they do? Like what should they Well, hang on. We've got someone representing the government here, so let's find out. So, so, so just clarify for everybody here who may not be be familiar with it. As I understand it, MPs are not allowed to disuss the royal family in the comment. Is that right? It's a long-standing protocol that MPs are not supposed to get into the detail of debating the royal family. You can talk about constitutional issues in the in the Commons, but you're not supposed to get into the personal details of a particular member of the royal family. And Karan has made it clear he's not going to make time for MP to debate Prince Andrew, but we are having this public accounts committee inquire into rural law and this is something that's Kstar is supporting. Yes. What do you think can come out of that? What what is the what is the outcome do you think that would be most desirable? So I think the public you think you should leave I I think the public accounts committee is going to dig into the detail around the leasing arrangements for Royal Lodge which have been in the public domain for for almost two decades actually. Yeah. And so they're coming quite late to this. There's a there's a peppercorn rent, isn't there? And then it's a question of uh how was the maintenance paid for? Uh was there an advanced payment on leasing the lodge? We there's certain questions that need to be asked and what we are told. Well, it looked at it in the public domain, which is why I'm interested as to what exactly they think they're going to find out. So, as as we are told, something like 8.75 million was given by Andrew up front. Um he then is is liable for the maintenance of the property. Um he's got a lease that goes on till 2078 something like that. Um and in return for all that upfront payment he pays a peppercorn rent which could be nothing, could be a pound, it could be something like that. So what is there left for them to find out? And what do you think could happen as a result? Well, I think they've got to dig into where the money is coming from. I mean sunlight is the best disinfectant. So we need to establish the facts. Uh, Prince Charles, uh, sorry, excuse me, King Charles has made it clear that, um, Prince Andrew no longer receives any public money in terms of the royal allowance to get, which was a million pounds. That's gone. I think he only is getting his Royal Navy pension in terms of that's income that we know about. So I think we, you know, until all of the facts are established, it's it's difficult to to say much more about the work that the public accounts committee is going to do, but we very much welcome the fact that they are going to launch that inquiry. And do you think he should stay in Royal Lodge in Great Windsor Park for this Peporn Rent? Well, I think it is best for the royal family to determine that because I think we we fully support what the king has done in terms of removing Andrew's uh titles. Uh stopping all of the public money that was going to him. Um any further action I think should be based on a conversation between the king and Andrew himself. One thing I would want to say is we we do for perfectly understandable reasons we get into the conversation about Andrew, but I just think it's really important as well that we remember the victims in all of this. Um Virginia Duprey incredibly brave in what she did, utterly tragic that she took her own life and there are many many more like her and we need to get to the bottom of this network at the center of which was a monster Jeffrey Epstein and it is absolutely right is not when I say sunlight's the best disinfectant not just around financial matters but also what actually happened. Now, Andrew has said that he is prepared to go and give uh evidence and share information in these inquiries that I think could be helpful with the inquiries. I hope that he does that. You know, he should be as good as as his word and he should go and do"

The cost of a typical carton of supermarket juice has gone from 76p to 179 in 5 years. In fact, all of these orange juice cartons of different types have shot up. Most orange juice concentrate used to make basic orange juice comes from Brazil, which has seen 5 years of bad crops due to severe drought and a bacterial disease called citrus greening. Global prices saw a huge spike in response which we're not expecting to see come back down as other groceries rise too. Now when you think oranges you think Valencia, Seville, Spain, but they're also experiencing weather related problems for their exports which they tend to export as fruit. And you'll also think of Florida, the sunshine state, but they're also experiencing that citrus greening and a lot of hurricans. So what does this mean for your orange juice? Well, you probably noticed the price, but big brands are also now mixing orange juice blends, mixing them with mango, mandarins, clementines, pear, which saves them money, but keeps them sweet, too.

Uh we're going to bring you some breaking news from the world of sport because Sheffield Wednesday, we understand has filed for administration. Um a number of issues here, financial issues. Uh a number of the players, many of the players have not been um paid for many many months now. Uh there's also been issues with regulation. uh many uh regulation breaches have been recorded, longunning issues uh with debt and when we talk about the regulations, we're talking about EFL. Um so let's cross to the BBC's Ben Croucher who has all the latest details. Ben, what on earth is going on? Well, quite simply, Sheffield Wednesday who play in the second tier of English football have filed for notice to be put into administration this morning. Now, this has been a longunning saga within the English game regarding Sheffield Wednesday. Only earlier this week, we discovered that the HMRC were intending to serve them with a winding up addition uh due to tax debts running up to around a million pounds. We understand now this administration would effectively serve as a buffer and buy them a little bit more time. Administrators will come in, we understand, and take over the running of the club. Now, this has been going on for a long, long time. Five of the last seven months, Sheffield Wednesday staff and players have not been paid on time. In sporting terms, the EFL, who run the league that Sheffield Wednesday play in, have served them with sanctions, meaning that they can't pay money to pay players. Just at the start of the season, they only had 15 senior players on their books, and they currently sit bottom of the Championship, the league that they play in. Now with what this administration will also do is pretty much give them a 12point deduction as well. They're already sitting at the bottom of that league. So from a sporting sense, relegation is now very much on the cards. And only earlier this week, we saw fans protesting against the club's owner, Despon Chanceri, and the way that he has been running the club over the last 10 years. where they have filed for notice to be placed into administration which could potentially see the end of Chanceri's ownership at Hillsborough. Uh Ben, Wednesday there was a game of course and I think that's where we began to to see the anger of the fans. Just just tell us what happened. There was a mass protest to put it simply. They were playing against Middlesborough team at the other end of the league and the fans simply didn't turn up. Now, the official attendance was registered at over 20,000, but just looking around Hillsborough on Wednesday night, and clearly that wasn't the case. They record season ticket holders, even if they don't actually attend the game. There are around 4,000 Middlesbrough fans in attendance for that match. There probably weren't many more Sheffield Wednesday fans. So, they have been voting with their feet. Many fans angry at the way that the club is being run and quite simply not wanting to put money into the club to go into the owner's pockets. they voted with their feet whether this administration or whether a change of ownership would likely see the fans return in their numbers. Ben, just expand a little bit more on um the troubles regarding ownership. So Deshon Saniri has been in charge of the club for the last 10 years. He's a Thai businessman, but his relationship with the fans has soured in the way that he has been running the club. The fact that players and staff haven't been paid on time throughout the course of the year and the sporting sanctions that they have been placed under have had a real serious impact on their standing within the league. Only at the start of the season, just 10 days before the start of the season, they only had a new manager in place. They had barely any players. They weren't able to undertake any preseason friendlies in front of fans. Such was the situation. people questioning whether they would even be able to fill the first fixture of the season. And what this administration now means as well is that there's a high chance in January when the transfer window reopens that players could get sold maybe even for less than market value. So it really does have dire consequences for the running of the club. But on the flip side, administration could see the end of the Chanceriri ownership and that is what fans in Sheffield are really hoping for because their dislike of the the owner is is quite toxic at times. Okay, Ben, thank you very much for"
"n7zr4RIYi_s","Plaid Cymru makes history winning Welsh parliament by-election in Caerphilly | BBC News","Plaid Cymru defeated Reform UK in the Welsh Parliament by-election for Caerphilly, with Labour coming third and suffering its first parliamentary defeat there for 100 years.
 
Plaid's candidate Lindsay Whittle won 47% of the vote with a majority of 3,848, in what was the 14th time he has stood for election.
 
The result saw a swing of 27% from Labour, which has held the seat in Westminster since the 1920s and in the Senedd since it began.
 
A former Caerphilly council leader who has been a councillor for almost 50 years, Whittle said: ""We've beaten billionaire-backed Reform and, with the same determination, we can do it again in May 2026.""
 
He also paid an emotional tribute to the late Caerphilly Member of the Senedd Hefin David, whose death had triggered the by-election, saying David's ""kindness"" was the ""guiding spirit"" of his campaign.

Let's take a look at the winning moments. 15961. There it was. It is the 14th time lucky for Lindsay Whittle. The plighted candidate had stood time and time again in the constituency at elections for Westminster and Cardiff Bay since 1983. He said winning the Senate bi-election was better than scoring the winning try for Wales against New Zealand in the Rugby World Cup. Here's the final number of votes for each candidate. Clyde's Lindsey Whittle a clear lead with almost 16,000 votes. Reform UK's Cla Powell came in second with just over 12,000 votes. The Cavilli bi-election has seen a record turnout at the polling booths. More than half the electorate voted and 47.4% of those cast ballots went to ply Cry who overturned a century of Labor dominance in the electorate. Well, Pied Camry's leader Rein Abby celebrated his party's win, saying voters chose a progressive alternative to Labor. It was a hard-fought win. I think most commentators were expecting it to be closer than this. It turns out that it wasn't particularly close and it sends a very very clear message ahead of the Senate elections just 6 months away. So historic for Cap Philly, historic for for Ply Cry. Certainly the appreciation of the work that Lindsay has done over so many years as a counselor here came uh very very clear over the past few weeks. Well, Labour won just an 11% share of the vote and the Labour minister and Tofan MP Nick Thomas Simons says his party's loss in Cili is disappointing but not surprising. We've had thousands of conversations on the doorstep. We treat this result with humility. We've heard what uh people say about speeding up uh that pace of change. Uh but look, bi-elections are always difficult for incumbent governments and this one was no different in that regard. And coming second uh was reform UK. Let's listen to the reaction from the chairman David Bull. In some ways disappointing for us, but actually it's an amazing result on another hand because actually we're only four years old as a party. At the last election we got 1.7% and this morning we got 36%. That's a meteoric rise for us and I think actually pretty unprecedented in modern political history. What we can see from that of course is the decimation of labor. As you said in your introduction, this is a 100red years of labor rule. Labor trounc going down to 11%."

The group which comprises 33 nations including the UK and France was set up to strengthen Ukraine's defenses and to provide security guarantees in the event of a ceasefire. Ukraine's leader, President Zilinski, is traveling to London from Brussels, where European Union leaders agreed to help support Ukraine's financial needs for the next two years. Meanwhile, two Russian planes from the Kinenrad Enclave briefly entered Lithuanian airspace on Thursday. That is according to the Lithuanian military. Spanish NATO aircraft were scrambled in response to the violation. Well, let's speak now to Alexander Har, former adviser to Ukraine's Ministry of Defense and now director of the Center for Defense Strategies who joins me from Keev. Hello to you. Thank you very much for speaking to us here on BBC News. So, the coalition of the willing um how high will expect expectations be from President Zilinski that something concrete is going to come out of the meeting today? Uh first of all, we highly appreciate what the the United Kingdom has been doing uh ever since the Russians invaded Ukraine back in 2014 and consecutive governments were supporting Ukraine in various ways. And certainly in 2022, the UK played a major role in gathering uh coalition that support Ukraine uh in in this fight against Russia. uh I don't put much uh hopes in into the coalition willing because I believe the whole idea it is a great idea uh but with the point that this contingent will be deployed after there is a ceasefire or or peace in Ukraine means that it may never happen because Russians are not willing to stop this war but if you're talking about practicalities certainly it's a good thing that the longrange missiles supply offline launch missiles to Ukraine uh will be discussed because it's something that we badly need to degrade Russia's war fighting capabilities and to degrade their uh energy infrastructure and push Russians to stop this war. Yeah, I mean there must have been disappointment last week when President Zilinsky went to the White House. The expectation was that the Tomahawk missiles would be forthcoming from the US. That didn't happen. So what's the alternative in terms of what the European Union can do or the coalition of the willing can do? Uh well, unfortunately, our European partners uh do not possess long-range missiles they would like to have since because the INF treaty that actually the United States withdrew from uh in in 2019 didn't allow the United States, Europeans, and Ukraine actually to produce land-based long-range missiles. But what the Europeans partners have in their possessions uh the missiles like Taurus and the German government has been uh suggesting that it's possible to supply them to Ukraine and with sculp missiles storm shadows the British made missiles there would be more success of Ukrainian armed forces in in fending of the Russians and I believe it's important to get those and particularly German missiles We aim to isolate Crimea. Crimea is a center for gravity of this war. We cannot liberate it with the land forces because there is an asymmetry in in in in manpower. But we can uh make Crimea like an island and it will pose a huge political dilemma for Putin and it may bring him to think to stop this aggression. What immediately would help Ukraine? Um, we hear a lot about the drones, the use of of of Russian drones. Are they the key um attack method at the moment? Is that what's causing the most damage? Well, yes. But there are several let's say domains uh with the uh the front line in the east and the Russians have some advantages there and because of all the mass they they they disregard the number of casualties on their side and they're trying to advance even uh on tactically unimportant places but they want to project a power and they project an image that nothing can stop them. The other thing is a daily uh bombardment of Ukrainian cities and Ukrainian civilian infrastructure and particularly energy generation infrastructure. For example, now I I use the lithium battery to power my laptop, my Wi-Fi and and lighting here and there is a blackout in my part of the city. So we adjusted to to to the Russian bombardments. Anyway, uh it's something that is damaging Ukrainian economy and lives of civilians. And the other thing that is really important, it's our ability to target deep into Russia their energy infrastructure. Production of drones and missiles and uh other military objects. That's why we need the western missiles and uh Tamagak missiles would be really uh really helpful here. uh but we need components and technologies uh for our homegrown production. We can produce cheaper and faster than our European and American partners and we need uh those missiles and drones and mass to to to to coers putting uh to negotiations or to to have a pose in this war. Um, you said when we first spoke to you, we were talking about the coalition of the willing and and you rightly point out that that um that one of their aims is to talk about how Ukraine could be supported when the war has ended. Um, that must still seem like a a very long way off. Well, yes, but what of may do and we've been asking for that for a couple of years is protect our skies. So the western capabilities like jets and air defense systems may protect at least half of Ukraine uh or the Nepra river that cuts Ukraine into two halves. uh and it's possible to do without any vi uh the any prospects of direct clash between NATO or collision partners against Russians because Russian missiles and drones do not have uh the military personnel in them and that's why you know shutting them down would not cause the the the war between NATO and and Europe. It's something that is possible to do. The other thing is possible to do is to uh deploy trainers, the military trainers to Ukraine that they can train Ukrainian troops to fight the modern warfare uh with with uh you know cutting the expenses on transferring huge amount of Ukrainians to the foreign countries and training them there. The other thing that our partners can help is to help our command and control structures to uh jointly plan operations and there are some good instances and there is a success story and particularly with the United Kingdom they've been helpful to us and there are many other technical things like sharing intelligence the the I I can name many many other instances where where the deployment of coalition winning not in mass not those those who will be in trenches in the and fighting against Russians, but helping Ukrainian defense forces to to uh build build up their capabilities. And one of the issues on the table as well that's likely to be talked about today is the issue of money and whether frozen Russian assets uh should be unfrozen and the money used to to help Ukraine. All of this stuff that you're talking about costs a lot of money. Um so Ukraine really does need that funding as well. Well, yeah, you're absolutely right because no, Russia should pay uh for the uh uh their uh war of aggression against Ukraine and not just Ukraine. Uh the they've been at war with Europe. It's the problem that European societies and governments do not want to acknowledge that and to react properly. Uh and I'm talking about the different type types of warfare. It's a cyber. It's cutting the undersea the cables. It's a political involvement in campaigns in Europe elsewhere. Now in the United Kingdom, there is an investigation of the alleged participation of Russian uh intelligence and money helping to to to bring uh the United Kingdom out of the European Union. uh and the Russians who are actively engaged in uh elections uh in other countries as well. Not to mention sabotage act, acts of sabotage, killing uh on the territory of other countries. And particularly in Britain, you had the case of Lipinena, an attempt to poise scrials uh intelligence gathering and many many other things. Not to mention the uh incursion into airspace of NATO. Fortunately, now Poland and other countries are ready to shut down Russian drones and missiles that are violating their airspace and and I hope they will be shutting down Russian jets as well. This is the only way how to show Russia that it's it cannot uh let's say it cannot intermediate NATO and show that article 5 doesn't work. So all these things are really important and talking about money. Yes, we would love to see Europeans and particularly Belgium to uh provide us with this frozen Russian assets and they should understand that uh this is not a peace time for Europe. It's already uh the phase zero of the Russian aggression against Europe and it's possible not in five years when Russia will be able to reconstitute his land forces and other uh parts of the military but they can do it right now the the only goal for Russia to show that article 5 doesn't work and for that they don't have don't need to have a mask. Alexander we will have to leave it there. It's really good uh to talk to you and hear your thoughts on that meeting today. Alexander Cara, their former adviser to Ukraine's Ministry of Defense. Well, let's speak now to our correspondent in Kev, John Sudworth. Uh John, hello to you. Um we were just listening there to the Ukraine's uh former adviser to the Ministry of Defense really talking there about the need for uh longrange weapons and also money, finance um to help uh Ukraine's defense. Are those issues likely to be discussed today at the Coalition of the Willing? Very much so, Sarah. I mean, all of the focus now is on imposing costs on Russia already struggling, of course, uh, as a result of the war and the existing sanctions packages. Uh, we had those talks in Brussels, um, uh, you know, focused on, uh, the latest package of sanctions. uh they coincide with an announcement from Washington, the first time under President Trump that we've had a sanctions package uh targeting Russia's two largest oil companies. So uh that will impose further costs on Moscow, no doubt about it. the focus in London uh with President Zilinski there today uh not only speaking to uh K Starmmer, the British Prime Minister, but other European allies, some in person, some joining by video link, will be on what President Zilinsky euphemistically calls long range sanctions. Uh namely, uh more weaponry that allows Ukraine's military to strike targets deeper and deeper inside Russia. Uh this week uh we had the news that Ukraine had hit uh a Russian chemical plant with Britishmade storm shadow missiles. And it's those kind of uh weapons that Ukraine wants more of. All the while, of course, President Vladimir Putin, a man whose words are passed very carefully, of course, as the head of a nuclear power attempting uh to raise the risk and some caution. In his latest press conference, he said providing Ukraine with these kind of long range weapons would have serious, if not staggering, consequences, he said. And just remind us, John, about the coalition of the willing, um why it was set up. what what's what what is it hoping to uh achieve in that relationship with Kev? Well, it's all about bolstering uh support both financial and military support for Ukraine in particular at a time when that support is under question uh in Washington. Um the sense that you know aid under President Biden has stopped under President Trump. We are in a very different era and Ukraine knows that it needs to increasingly rely on its allies in Europe. That's exactly what President Trump has been saying. And you know, Sarah, you know, the the bigger sort of picture here, um, you know, President Trump is talking about freezing this conflict along current lines and both sides going home. When you look at the the the situation uh on the front lines and the battleground, uh you know, Russia already occupies uh Ukrainian territory equivalent in size, back of an envelope sort of calculation, but roughly equivalent in size to the area of Greece. And it still claims it still wants to fight on for a an an additional area roughly equivalent in size to Belgium. These are not small parts of territory. They involve hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian citizens. Uh Ukraine uh is uh has lost many lives already uh trying to defend its territory. There is no sign that Russia is ready to stop fighting. So Europe knows uh that peace is not around the corner and everything now is focused on imposing costs on Russia to make it more serious to bring it to the table and get it into a position where it is really ready to make concessions. Okay, John Sedworth in key for the moment."

These are very big. Those are against their two big oil companies and we hope that they won't be on for long. We hope that uh the war will be settled. The United States has announced sanctions on Russia's two largest oil companies. Why has President Trump changed his mind on this and what will it mean? We'll discuss on this latest episode of the BBC's Daily News podcast newscast. Now, we've had another change in position from Donald Trump when it comes to Russia. This time last week on Thursday evening, we were talking about that phone call that Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin had, which seemed to go very well. So well that Trump was planning to have a summit with him face to face in Hungary. Then we had a phone call between Marco Rubio, the US Secretary of State, and the Russians, which did not go well. The summit was off. And then on Wednesday night, we found out that Donald Trump was going to do something he'd been quite reticent to do up until now, which was to apply some pretty sweeping sanctions on two big Russian energy companies. So, what has gone on and what's going to happen next? The two people who can help us work that out are here. Joining us from Moscow is the BBC Russia editor, Steve Rosenberg. Hi, Steve. Hello there, Adam. And Sumi Sumiscandanda is in Washington, DC. Hello, Sumi. Hey, Adam. So Sumi, first of all, um, just how did Donald Trump make this announcement about these sanctions on Russia? Because I'm guessing with Donald Trump, there was an element of of performance. Yeah, we had been told all day that his meeting with the NATO Secretary General Mara would be closed press and of course, as is often the case with Donald Trump, it then opened up and he was sitting ass alongside Mara. Again, we know these two men have a pretty good relationship, a close relationship. Our listeners might remember that Mark Wera called him daddy. uh President Trump daddy in the past and they were sitting side by side and President Trump uh talked about the sanctions that are going to be put on uh Russia to Russian companies and we had heard just before that press availability that the Treasury Secretary Scott Bessant had actually announced these sanctions saying it was time for them to come and that's exactly what President Trump said he said I just felt it was time he was asked specifically by a reporter why now and he said uh that he had cancelled um the meeting with uh Vladimir Putin, this planned summit in Budapest that he had talked about just last week because he felt it wasn't going to go anywhere. So, you did get a shift in tone there, but sitting again with his good friend who is also a big supporter of Ukraine. And we'll talk a bit more about the timeline in a second, but Steve, just tell us a bit more about Rosf and and Luke Oil, the companies that we're talking about here. These are big companies. These are the two largest Russian oil companies. They account for I think nearly half of Russia's crude oil exports. So uh these are big fish and I think the the sanctions have come as a bit of a surprise to the Russians. They weren't expecting it. I was reading something in the Russian papers only yesterday some commentator saying that uh it's clear that Donald Trump wasn't going to take tough measures uh against Russia and then bang suddenly you have these sanctions against Ross and Luke Oil. And Steve, what could they mean practically for those companies? Because is is this just American companies can't do business with them or are there knock-on effects around the world that could really really be felt in Russia? So yeah, first of all, the assets of these companies in America will be frozen and American companies and uh individuals won't be able to do business with them. But yeah, there could well be a knock-on effect for other countries and it's going to be really interesting to see what the big buyers of Russian oil do now. So for example, countries like India which buy a lot of Russian oil already at a discount. Um will they reduce that the amount of oil they buy? Will they curtail that uh to avoid uh US sanctions? It'll be really important to follow that in the next few days. And Sumi, you hinted at at this about kind of the the cogs turning in Donald Trump's mind, but what what do you think has been been going on in there in the last few days? Yeah, it's so interesting. We were watching last week that President Trump had this long phone call with Vladimir Putin. He said it was very constructive just before meeting Vladimir Zilinsky in the White House. And indeed, you know, Financial Times reporters said that that meeting with President Zilinsky in the White House actually got quite testy and that President Trump was tossing maps around, right? And you got the sense again, okay, President Trump has shifted his position. You know, he's vacasillated between um being tougher on Vladimir Putin, expressing frustration there, and then being tougher on Vladimir Zilinski, expressing frustration with him. You know what I think is actually really interesting to think about is we saw his secretary of state, Marco Rubio, have a phone call with Sergey Labra, the Russian foreign minister. And remember until now the special envoy Steve Wickoff has been the one kind of leading the negotiations with Vladimir Putin. And I think the fact that it was the secretary of state Marco Rubio who you know they had said there would be high level negotiations happening between the two sides this week. I think he got on the phone call and realized Russia has not changed his position. not that Russia had ever claimed to do so, but relayed that to Donald Trump to say, ""Look, the Russians are not backing down. And what is the point of a summit if it's going to be more or less more of the same?"" That could have been a big factor there. And the fact, and this this is the second that I think that that I think is important, President Trump has been receiving the question of late, have you been played by President Putin? you know, he said, ""Yeah, I've been played by uh many people over my life, but I've come out really well."" Uh, more or less, I'm paraphrasing. But because he's gotten that question more and more, you know, you do wonder if that's been something that's been part of his thinking and the shift to move towards sanctions this week. And of course, Sumi, one of the other significant things about this move this week is that up until now, Donald Trump has said he would only do this if the Europeans stopped buying Russian oil and gas, too. So, actually, he sort of jumped his own gun a bit. He did. He did. And he he has uh underlined that message over and over again with European partners to say sanctions will come when you stop completely from buying Russian oil and gas. To be fair, he had that conversation with the um European Commission President was Aafandeline in the past and they have said that European countries will be committed to um you know buying no Russian oil and gas in the future. In the meantime, it's not possible, but they're looking to get there. But yeah, you're right. he did jump his own gun in that sense and I think it really was because of some of the the pressure and perhaps the messaging that he is hearing on this. And then in terms of negotiations uh between Russia and Ukraine kind of brokered by the Americans, Sunumi, it seems to me now that Donald Trump is pretty wedded to this idea that the basis for the negotiations would be freezing the conflict on the current front line. Yeah, and that's not new. We should say that is something that has been discussed by the Ukrainians, by the Europeans for some time now and Steve obviously can talk about that as well, but it's certainly something that President Trump uh as we understand discussed with Limmer Zilinski in the White House on Friday. The problem is the Russian demand of course that Russia takes all of the Donbass region and that is something that is a complete non-starter for the Ukrainians and the Europeans. Um but freezing the conflict along current lines seems to be and if you look at some of the social media messaging from President Trump, he's basically saying lay down weapons and leave things where they are now. We can start to negotiate. Um if there is an effective way to push Russia to accept that it would not take over all of the Donbass, that could be a first point where you see the two sides move closer towards negotiations. But I'm not sure uh how you get there. Yeah. And Steve, how do the Russians respond to that idea of of freezing the conflict where it is now? Uh they don't accept that. It's a complete non-starter for the Kremlin. Uh and they've made that position clear uh to the White House, to Donald Trump. And over the last few days, the Russian newspapers have been making the same point. Um, in fact, you know, when Donald Trump announced this Budapest summit within within two weeks, um, it was, I think, pretty clear that there was no guarantee it was going to happen. Russian newspapers were writing that um there was no point in Russia uh to to announce a ceasefire, that the special military operation would go on, especially after Donald Trump uh came out publicly and said that it was important to freeze the the battle lines as they are. Russia simply doesn't accept that. It's pushing on um it's a minimum, I think, for Moscow to get control of the whole of the Donbass. uh and there is no way that Ukraine is going to accept to hand over the part of the Donbass. It's still it still controls. So, it's hard to see where where things go from here. And Sumi, one of the other things that was on the table, although I don't know if they ever got as far as the table, but certainly in the ether around the table, was this idea of tomahawk missiles being given to the Ukrainians by the Americans? What's happened to them? Yeah. So, we understand that President Zilinski left the White House without any progress on that. He said, you know, President Trump didn't say yes, but he didn't say no, seeing some hope perhaps for the future. But when President Trump was asked about this in the White House on Tuesday when he was sitting with Mark Bera, he said, ""Look, what you don't understand is the Tomahawk missiles cannot be put into play immediately. They take a significant amount of training. There's what he called basically a six-month gap before they can actually be used."" So he didn't see the point in allowing Ukraine to have these missiles and to use them to strike far deep into Russia at this point. That doesn't mean that it is completely off the table, however, and certainly the Ukrainians are still pushing to be able to have that long range missile capacity to bring the war closer to home in Russia. M and Sumi, you mentioned uh Trump's vacasillation where on a Friday it can seem that he's anti- Ukrainian and pro- Kremlin and then by Thursday he's being anti- Kremlin and a bit more pro- Ukrainian or at least neutral towards Ukraine. Steve, how does that vacasillation feel kind of an ocean away? I mean, of course, the UK is an ocean away, too, but you're an ocean you're an ocean and a continent away. Yeah, I think the Russians are getting a little bit confused and frustrated by it as well. Uh they're they're getting used to it. Um and um people are writing about it in in the press. But I think the key question now really after these sanctions uh announced on Lucille and Ross Neft is are these sanctions going to force a change in uh in the Kremlin? In other words, will they be enough to bring the Kremlin to the to the negotiating table? Up till now, um, nothing that America has done or none of the thousands of sanctions that have been imposed on Russia have forced a change of course on Ukraine by from the Kremlin. Uh, and the huge casualties on the battlefield that Russia has incurred have not forced a change in course from from Vladimir Putin. But the thing is to continue to to wage a war, you need money. You know, Vladimir Putin is not a magician. He can't wave his criminal magic wand and suddenly magic up all this money. And the truth is, objectively, there is less money than there was in the state coffers here to wage a war. I mean, the economy has survived sanctions, but it's not good. It's not strong at the moment. Um, the budget deficits rising, oil and gas revenues are falling. The government's going to have to put up VAT by 2% here from 20% to 22% to try to fill the gap. And every day uh the Russian newspapers are writing about quite openly about the economic problems um in the country and that's a huge problem because they need money to continue to to to uh wage the war and and on the the government finances of Russia there's a separate conversation going on in Brussels right now a summit of EU leaders about is there a way of of using the the Russian assets central government assets which are in Europe European banks or in banks in Europe um to turn somehow turn them using some chicainery into a loan for Ukraine for 2026 and 2027. So that that that's happening as well, right? Something completely different although you did nod to this Steve about the the Russian economy. Um yesterday's newscast we had a big chat with Fisel Islam about the significance of the price of orange juice. Are there particular items in your countries that just kind of at the moment really reveal how the economy is feeling? Steve, you were talking about the Russian economy a second ago. Is there a particular item that people point to and go, ""Oh yeah, the price of that is the thing that's on my mind."" People often talk about the price of buckwheat uh in Russia actually as an indicator of where things are going. Also in in recent months, people have been talking about the price of of butter and dairy products because the price of butter has gone right. In fact, in in the Russian papers today, they were talking about butter. I've got um one of the papers here today. If I can find it. Excellent newspaper reading sound effects there. Yeah, look at that. There we go. Front page news. front page news about um the price of butter uh which has been zooming up u by 38% um this year right and uh demand for dairy products has been going down because people can't afford everything that is an indication I think of the economic problems in the country because inflation has been a problem um prices on all kinds of things have gone up um in some Russian supermarkets they've been starting to sell butter in these sort of safety boxes, security boxes, um, to stop theft. So, that's all an indication, I think, of of sort of economic troubles ahead. Um, Sumi, we've talked about the price of eggs in the US before. Is it still is it still the price of eggs? You know what it is actually at this point is the price of beef. So, I should say full disclosure, I'm a vegetarian, so this does not affect me. But, um, the price of beef, I was just looking it up. It's gone up 51% since February 2020. The price of beef is as high as it's been here in the US. And this is now really affecting consumers. And it's gotten really interesting because uh President Trump and his administration are starting to or making a plan to import beef from Argentina to help push those costs down. But as you can imagine, you know, cattle farmers, cattle ranchers here in the US are not happy about that and they are voicing their discontent. And in fact, some Republican members of Congress who represent those farming regions are also pushing back a bit on this plan. So there's some trouble in there for President Trump on beef prices. And is there anything happening with beef just in people's daily lives? I don't know. Are burgers getting smaller? Are people having chicken burgers instead? That's a good question. Will they then move to, you know, other forms of meat? I haven't seen the numbers if on whether you know chicken consumption is going up, but certainly uh ground beef um the prices of that of you know that families buy for you know making burgers at home or you can tell I'm a vegetarian. I don't know what people do with ground beef. It's a very versatile item. I suppose the index for you Sumi as a vegetarian will be if there's an increase in people asking you for vegetarian recipes that will be the signal that the price of beef has reached crisis levels. Um Sumi thank you very much. Thanks for having me and Steve thanks to you too. Thanks Adam."

US President Donald Trump has pardoned the founder of the crypto exchange Binance. That was Changpang Xiao, who had been convicted of money laundering. The White House press secretary Caroline Leit said the president issued the pardon because Xiao, as she put it, was prosecuted by the Biden administration in their war on cryptocurrency. Well, our North America business correspondent, Michelle Flurry, has been uh looking at this story for us in the last few minutes. Remind us, Michelle, what did Changpang Xiao do to end up in this situation in the first place? Yes. So I mean I think the thing to remember is you have to go back a couple of years to 2022 2023 and you know Changpang Xiao or CZ as he's often referred to the CEO of Binance at the time was a monumental figure in the world of cryptocurrencies uh along with Sam Bankman Freed. Now, at the time, uh, he ended up caught up in a scandal and pleaded guilty ultimately to un anti-money laundering laws to violating those laws in the United States. And for that, he was sentenced and served four months in prison. So, given that he's been out of jail now for several months, almost a year, uh, what is the significance of the pardon? Well, it means that when you are a convicted felon in the United States, you can't serve uh on the board of a company uh like Binance operating in this financial sphere, operating essentially a trading platform. Uh and so having this pardon kind of clears the way for him to make a return to Binance and to the world of cryptocurrency. And this is something that, you know, people who watch these things closely have been speculating, I have to say, tag for a while now. um some you know one sort of very close watcher of his social media handle had noticed in September that he changed his handle from ex Binance to just Binance. Uh so there was speculation that you know maybe this pardon was in the works uh and that this that he was sort of clearing the way back to kind of returning to control of the company he founded. And Caroline Le is right. The Biden administration certainly did have a different attitude towards cryptocurrency than the Trump administration. A world in which Donald Trump's family have become deeply personally uh involved. Well, and this is where it raises uh some eyebrows perhaps. You know, I mean, there are going to be questions about conflicts of interest here, not least because uh the Wall Street Journal reported back in the spring that there were conversations between the Trump family and about taking a stake in Binance, the company that CZ founded. Um, so there are lots of questions about, you know, how much of this is motivated by uh money and and profits and and again uh it's going to bring renewed focus and scrutiny to the Trump family's involvement in the crypto world uh and and how it sort of interplays with the White House. Michelle Flurry in New York. Thank you for that."
"Cvqnnk27xH4","The Tech Billionaire Taking on OpenAI and Google   | BBC News","In an interview with Amol Rajan for his BBC podcast, Radical with Amol Rajan, the CEO of cybersecurity giant Cloudflare explains how artificial intelligence is transforming the internet. 
 
Matthew Prince’s company is blocking the AI “crawler” bots that scrape content to train large language models like OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini from accessing the websites of its customers. 
 
He hopes his decision will lead to a better deal for publishers as ‘search engines’ become ‘answer engines’ in the era of AI overviews and chatbots, which he says is having an impact on website traffic.

That deal is what has generated the internet that we have that we have today. But that deal is changing and and you can actually see it by just watching any sci-fi movie. Um some sci-fi movie you imagine has a helpful robot uh and you say I'd like a recipe for cookies. The robot doesn't come back and say, ""Here are 10 links and maybe you can find it somewhere."" The robot comes back and says, ""Here's a recipe for cookies."" And that once upon a time was science fiction. But if you look at the AI companies today, you look at something like Chat GPT, you look at anthropic, you look even at what Google is becoming where they're putting AI overviews at the top of the page. Instead of it giving you a treasure map, instead of it being a search engine, this is becoming an answer engine. But how did you come to realize that this was a growing phenomenon and actually the the complaints people were maybe make making to you which is hey Matthew you know I'm using your stuff but you know people aren't coming to me as much as they used to. What we started to hear because we have so many clients uh is is at first media companies coming to us and just saying we're getting killed and our business primarily is to protect against cyber attacks, you know, the the Chinese or the Russians or the North Koreans or the Iranians, you know, hacking um folks. And so when they were like, we have this new threat and it's AI companies, my first reaction was, oh god, it's media companies that, you know, roll my eyes. They're just complaining about new technology again. They're such lites. Like you know what? What's journalists? Lites. Seriously. Hey, you're in the BBC now, bossy. Yeah. And so, you know, I think that that was um that was my first reaction. And and company after company after company said, ""Just go pull the data."" And so we did. And people might not totally understand how search engines work, but the way that they work is essentially they have a little uh a little robot or or what's might be called a crawler or a bot that's that's going around and visiting everything on the internet. And so Google every day is making, you know, billions of requests to access all of the content of the internet and it gets a copy of everything that has been created and then it uses that to build an index which is what is the what the search engine is and then when you search it returns the results that you see. And so the deal has been that you let Google copy your content in in exchange for appearing in their treasure map that they that they have. You get the visibility. That's right. And so we can see for the last 10 years what the ratio of how much Google crawls that content Google takes it versus how many page views, how many visitors they actually send you. And the ratio 10 years ago was they crawled two pages for every one visitor that they sent you. So they crawled two, they sent you one visitor. Over that period of time that has gotten much much worse. So today it's up to almost 20 to one. They crawl 20 pages for every one visitor. What's changed? AI overviews because that then says I don't have to click on anything. I don't have to go anywhere. I get the answer right there. And that's the good news for publishers. If you look at folks like OpenAI with Chat GPT, they're at 1,500 crawls for every one visitor that they send you. If you look at something like Anthropic, it's 40,000 crawls for every one visitor you send you. And and just from a fairness perspective, like that's putting that's that's cost to the BBC. That's cost to content creators. They have to pay for all of that crawled content. And yet they're not getting anything in exchange. they're not getting the traffic and the world over time is going to move to these answer engines and as it does it means that the deal that content creators have with them it has to change and you made in that context and in the context of all we're discussing about the development of AI um quite remarkable decision which is that you said AI bots will not be allowed to scrape the data from websites that are protected by Cloudflare technology. Can you just explain precisely what was the decision you made and why did you make it? So, it's it comes back to where we started with the conversations uh with media companies where they said our businesses are getting killed because people are taking our data, they're using it to give answers in their answer engines, but they're not sending us anything back. They're not paying us. They're not sending us traffic that we can monetize in one way or another. And so we started to think about, you know, what could happen. And again, we we walked through and we said, you know, done right, we could create a an actually a new market and a new business model which might not only be better for media companies, but might be better for society as a whole, where we get away from kind of the rage baiting, dividing media that we have today back to rewarding real content creation. And the question is, how do you get there? And you need a market. And the challenge is that no markets can exist without scarcity. There's not a market for air unless you're scuba diving, right? Because there's no air underwater. So you have to pay someone to put air in a tank and then you breathe that air and and they make money from the scarcity of air, right? If every media company is just giving their content away for free and they're letting anyone take it and they're not getting anything back, then there will never be a market. And so in order for us to get to that better media place, in order for us to understand that, we said we have to restrict this and the media companies, you know, again because they don't have the same technical sophistication often as as as someone like Laughler does, uh they didn't have the tools to be able to do that. And we really do believe that again coming back to those journalists who are covering government corruption, coming back to the small local newspaper that we own, we think that media is such a critical part of society and it deserves to be protected. And so we said we need to engage in this and we need to take all we've learned from stopping you know hackers around the world and apply that to help media companies have the ability to stop these AI bots create scarcity and then hopefully what emerges is not not a world where all the media all the journalists starve to death not a world where all the media gets locked up behind five different AI companies but one where there's a fair exchange of value where if you're creating original content, you're paid for it. And and again, I think the first step in doing that is you've got to you've got to actually restrict the crawlers. How do you contend with the criticism or push back that though that might produce a better internet in some ways at this current moment in history, it's a sort of dangerous thing to put blocks on the innovation prompted by AI that anything that sort of places a limit on where AI can scrape away and and and provide data is both against is there's a liberal argument against it which is that people as you say want these services and they want the best possible you know chatbot to give you give them the best possible information to organize the best possible holiday as a genti but also that there's an economic danger potentially um even though you've made your decision for principled reasons you say there's an economic hazard in putting a sort of blocker on AI in some way yeah well there are lots of blockers on AI um you know if you want to get chips from Nvidia Jensen makes you pay for them uh Jensen twang the Jensen who who uh is the the CEO uh and founder of Nvidia if you want um you know to if you want to get the best researchers, you know, they get salaries. You we we we're not going to say, ""Oh, AI is so important that we're going to bring back slavery, right? It doesn't that doesn't make any sense."" So, I don't understand why if the content someone like you is producing is the is the fuel that's running these things. Why is it they have to pay for the chips, they have to pay for the researchers, but they don't have to pay for the content? Um, that doesn't make any sense to"

And it is the end of an era for fans of the BBC show Strictly Come Dancing because two main presenters, Tess Daily and Claudia Wkelman, have announced that they are going to be leaving the show. We have news. After 21 wonderfully joyful years on Strictly, we have decided that the time is right to step aside and pass over the baton, the very sparkly baton. Uh, you've been here since the beginning, 2004 with Brucey, lovely Bruce. I mean, that's over two decades ago, and a lot of that time has been with you. It's been a huge part of our lives, hasn't it? You know, since our children were literally babes in arms, and now they're young adults. And I think genuinely, we have cherished every second. We have. We're so lucky to have been part of this amazing show and we just want to thank the Strictly team because Strictly is the people who make it. So, thank you. They are the very best team in television. With me is our culture reporter No Nanji. So no, this is a big change, isn't it? Big news definitely in the entertainment world. I mean you said it there, this is sort of the end of an era. Test Daily, Claudia Wkelman have been the faces of this show for such a long time. I mean test daily has been there right from the start 21 years and then Claudia Wkelman she also joined as a main presenter in 2014 and we heard a bit of their joint statement there that went out on Instagram they said that they had cherished every second they thanked the Strictly team. They thanked the BBC and also the audiences who've been there right throughout. And they also, I thought it was quite interesting, said that they were always going to leave together and now just felt like the right time. And was this coordinated with the BBC as far as we know? Because obviously this show's also had a lot of uh difficulties and controversies, hasn't it, recently? Yeah, I think it's fair to say it has had a bit of a rocky time in the last couple of years. Well, we did get a BBC statement around 2 hours after that Instagram post went up on Tess Dy's account. So, they said that they also called it the end of an era. They said that Tess and Claudia had been both incredible hosts and that, you know, they praised their passion and dedication. But, as I say, that that statement came a couple of hours afterwards. But you're right, it has been a difficult period for the show. Of course, they celebrated their 20th anniversary last year. This is the 21st year, but it has faced a number of controversies relating to the behavior of some of their professional dancers and also some of the celebrity contestants on the show. But throughout Tess and Claude have been there fronting the show week in week out. So, this will be a big shock to a lot of people. And what we don't know is what's behind it. Why have they decided to leave right now? I mean, they are staying till the end of the series, but clearly they've announced this in the middle of a series. And also, we don't know who's going to replace them. And are the bets already up and running as to who could come next? And it gives the producers, I guess, a chance to to rethink the format of the show, think about who the audiences are that they're trying to target because it's still really popular. Definitely. And I think, you know, we're probably going to get a lot of these runners and riders pieces in the next coming hours. People will be really interested to know because these are two of the biggest roles on British television now up for grabs. Of course, we don't know who's going to replace them yet, but it is such a popular show. And I think that's what's really interesting because strictly, you know, as we've been saying, it started 21 years ago. I mean, the whole media landscape has changed so much in that much time. If you think about it, you know, with the advent of streaming and everything else, it the idea of families sitting around a TV on a Saturday night watching a live show like Strictly might feel slightly anneronistic, but it happens. They keep the audiences coming in. So, this is a really hit format for the BBC. It's a really important show for the corporation and there'll be a lot of interest to see how they keep it going and whether this does present an opportunity to perhaps shake up the format slightly. And do we know uh you know in terms of the audience numbers have they actually held up over those those time frames? It's a long time for a show to run in a very fragmented arena. Audience figures have held up reasonably well for Strictly and in some ways people describe it as one of the jewels in the BBC's crown. But you know I mean there are other hit shows. I mean we look at the traitors right now and in fact that is quite an interesting one to look at because of course Claudia Wkelman is also presenting the traitors and right now celebrity traitors. So when we think about the reasons why they might have taken this decision together and we do know that when Claudia Wkelman stepped back from her radio 2 presenting roles a couple of years ago. She said at the time that she wanted to spend more time with her family. Then the traitors took off. So we're not sure how much time she did get with her family. So it could have been that that fed into this decision, but as I say right now, no one's saying anything on that. Nor Nani, it' be intriguing to see who comes next. Thanks very much indeed."

The former British army paratrooper - who cannot be named because of a court order - was also found not guilty of five counts of attempted murder.
 
Thirteen people were shot dead, and 15 others injured, when soldiers opened fire at a civil rights demonstration in a predominantly Catholic part of the city.
 
The case of R v Soldier F was one of the most controversial, significant and high-profile trials over killings from the conflict in Northern Ireland.

The veteran known as Soldier F had been on trial charged with murder in relation to the killings of James Ray and William McKini, who were two of the 13 people shot dead by the Parachute Regiment at a civil rights demonstration. He was also charged with five counts of attempted murder. The judge at Belfast Crown Court has acquitted Soldier F of all charges. Chris Page reports. What happened in these streets more than half a century ago is captured on the walls and seared in people's minds. Bloody Sunday was one of the most deadly days during 30 years of violence in Northern Ireland. [Applause] A civil rights march in London Derry turned to carnage. The killings happened in the Bogside area, a part of Derry where most people were Irish nationalists. Soldiers from the Parachute Regiment shot dead 13 demonstrators. This image became one of the most prominent and poignant of the whole conflict. The Catholic priest, Father Edward Daly, trying to protect one of the victims, Jackie Dudy, after he was fatally wounded. It was completely outrageous, disgraceful. I I don't know. It's they call they call themselves an army. It's utterly disgraceful, I think. Are you quite sure that that nothing was fired at them first? There was nothing fired at them first. I'm absolutely certain of that. I can speak of this uh without any difficulty whatsoever because I was there. The army rejected that version of events, saying the paratroopers shot gunmen and bombers. But in 2010, a public inquiry said that on balance the soldiers did fire first and that none of the victims had posed any threat. Nine years later, prosecutors decided to charge a veteran known as Soldier F with murdering James Ray and William McKini. He was also accused of five counts of attempted murder. I heard live fire, but I didn't know where it was going or where it was coming from. John Kelly's brother, Michael, was also killed. Berieved families knew the trial they'd campaigned for would be harrowing. I can see everything in my mind's eye. It even puts me back to where I was that day and where I ended up with Michael because I helped to to carry Michael on the day afterwards and place him in the ambulance. But even going through that, again, it's worthwhile to me. Some veteran supporters claimed the prosecution reflected an imbalanced approach. There are many families of soldiers across Northern Ireland and indeed GB who have never had the truth regarding the death of their loved one. The trial focused on the shootings in this courtyard called Glenfa Park. People who were here on Bloody Sunday told the court that they'd been fired on as they ran away. Some described how they tried to protect themselves by lying still on the ground and pretending they were dead. The only evidence which specifically said Soldier Fired his rifle came in the form of statements which two other former paratroopers made to the initial investigations back in 1972. Defense lawyers argued the statements weren't reliable. In Derry, the walls of a museum bear the bullet marks from Bloody Sunday. Inside, there's James Ray's jacket torn by the shots which killed him. After 53 years of grief and controversy, the criminal process has ended with no conviction. Chris Page, BBC News. Well, Mickey McKinn was the brother of William McKini, one of the men that Soldier F was accused of killing. He gave this reaction to the court's decision on behalf of the bloody Sunday families. Soldier F has had been discharged from the defendant's criminal dock, but it is 1 million miles away from being an honorable discharge. Unlike his victims, there has been no declaration of Soldier F's innocence. Soldier F created two young widows on Bloody Sunday. He orphaned 12 children and he deprived dozens and of siblings of a loving brother. Despite the heroism, steadfastness and dignity of the bloody Sunday families and wounded, a cyard walks free from the dark today. Not through the front door of this courthouse like every other vindicated, wrongly accused offending proudly does, but instead once his curtain is peeled back for him creeping out the back door. The type of thug who is well used to special treatment, well used to have important and powerful connections with his police escorting to back over to Hiden Palace barracks where all this began. Mickey McKini there. Well, Paul Young is from the Northern Ireland Veterans Movement and he made a statement outside court once the verdict was given. Veterans across the whole of the United Kingdom that served in Northern Ireland with honor and courage will be hardened by this verdict today. You can hear the barrack that I'm getting from people behind me. That shows the good grace they do not have. And I will not comment on any further than that. Soldiers have beenounded. Elderly soldiers have beenounded. And I'm mindful of Dennis Hutchkins who was here in this very court and died trying to clear his name. The terrorists in this community murdered 44 soldiers in 1971 and 104 soldiers in 1972. I ask you, who's the terrorist? Paul Young there speaking out"

I'm Mark Lohen. We are live on St. Peter Square at the Vatican where a moment of history has just been made involving King Charles and Queen Camila who have been here at the Vatican meeting Pope Leo I 14th and for the first time a British monarch prayed alongside a pope, a Catholic pope for the first time in five centuries. The royal couple joined Pope Leo for a prayer service in the Cistine Chapel in a show of religious unity. It is the first time that the heads of the Catholic Church and the Church of England have joined in prayer since the Reformation 500 years ago. It comes at a difficult time for the royal family following new revelations about his brother, Prince Andrew, who last week relinquished his royal title. Let us just show you that moment. [Music] Pope Leo with uh the Archbishop of York there beside him and then King Charles and Queen Camela Camila in that uh prayer the first prayer shared between a British monarch and a pope in five centuries. Let us uh bring in our religion editor Alem Mcbull uh who is live with us from London. Alem, your thoughts today on this historic moment for uh two wings of the church between which there has been so much mistrust and tension for such a long time, but then uh coming together today in this real moment of unity and reconciliation. Well, striking pictures, striking symbolism. We're going to see more of it later in the day. Uh we've seen the praying together. We'll also see later in the day the beautiful basilica of St. pause outside the walls that uh an honorary title will be conferred on the king as well because that basilica before the reformation before 1534 uh was looked after in part by Anglo-Saxon rulers by English kings obviously that hasn't happened since but this will be an honorary title so so extraordinary gestures uh but what I would say watching this is you know this is not about marking a sea change suddenly in the relationship between these two churches. Yes, there was animosity, but we're talking about centuries ago. The groundwork for this has obviously been laid uh through the decades uh to a point where the churches are working together where popes have met monarchs in the past, have talked about their respect for monarchs. We remember Pope Francis talking about his respect for the late queen and the warm relationship that actually uh the king had as Prince Charles over the years in meeting several popes uh in the past. So uh it is extraordinary symbolism and the groundwork for this moment has been laid uh for many decades and in some senses there are those who are looking at this thinking it would have been very fitting if this had happened as originally planned uh in a meeting a prayer between the late Pope Francis and the king because these are two characters uh heads of of two churches who were really all about uh reaching out. Pope Francis was about reaching out to other faiths, other denominations. And of course, we know that the king has had a very profound interest in interfaith harmony. And uh of course when it was originally due to take place, Pope Francis was very ill. The king still met him, but it was in the final weeks of his life. But as I say, extraordinary symbolism in the pictures that we're seeing now. and Alm as we started speaking uh we saw the uh first images that we had in there of um uh King Charles and Queen Camila meeting Pope Leo the 14th in the apostolic palace before they then entered uh the Systeine Chapel. It is of course the first meeting also between the two heads of state. Of course uh the pope is the head of head of the state of the Vatican, the the smallest independent state. politics also at play here uh beyond the theological and religious significance and and the two men discussing matters that are close to their heart. Yes, no question. I mean this is a state visit. Yes, the Vatican is the smallest state but one that punches many many times above its weight. Uh there have been occasions in the past where uh you know the British government has been very keen to get the Vatican on board on some of its global projects for example uh issues like uh combating sexual violence in in conflict for example and so that was something where the British government had worked hard to get the Vatican on board because they recognized if the Vatican was on board was uh they if they had the same interests uh it was something that was extremely helpful on achieving some of the goals on the world stage. So certainly that is at the heart of this as well a political meeting between uh heads of state uh but of course uh with the backdrop of this uh religious symbolism and you know that there is a sense that uh the king has been uh keen for some time for a meeting like this. We know as I say that uh the palace and the Vatican had been working on it uh in the days uh and months preceding Pope Leo's uh uh election as as pope uh installation as Pope uh he's already met Pope Leo, one member of the royal family in uh in uh Prince Edward who attended the inaugural mass of Pope Leo in uh instead of uh in repres representing the king. Uh but now they get this uh this historic meeting together. Alem, thanks very much indeed. For now, uh let me just tell you what is happening here on St. Peter Square because uh we can see the uh Carabineri, the Italian military police at the ready. We think that uh King Charles's uh King Charles's car is going to uh come out of here uh imminently uh carrying the king and queen because they are then going to cross the city and go to the uh other hugely symbolic part of today. They will go to the papal basilica of St. Paul outside the walls uh which contains the tomb of St. Paul uh that the uh the English crown has for for centuries been involved in in upkeeping going back to Saxon times. Uh and uh we understand uh that that is uh that is imminent now. The departure of King Charles and Queen Camille to to that church and and at that church uh the king will be conferred with the title of uh royal confra that is a sign of the fraternity and unity. uh and also he will be given a seat a special chair uh which will bear his coat of arms and will be allowed to be used by him and his successors and heirs uh for centuries to come and uh that a sign uh of uh the another sign of symbolism and and and of unity between the two faiths. Salem that uh will also be an important moment of this visit and uh as as both the pope and the king get these are given these special titles by each other. Yeah. Again uh a striking gesture but like I say the two churches have long worked together. I know Church of England bishops go backwards and forwards working on various ecumenical projects together on various global issues together. Uh you might remember in early 2023 Pope Francis, the late Pope Francis and the then Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby traveled together uh for example to South Sudan to try to encourage peace. So you know for for a long time ecumenical projects and and work has gone on between the two churches. But again it will be a striking gesture in uh in in a stunning setting. St. outside the walls, one of the major basilas uh in Rome, just outside the uh the walls of the uh the ancient city. But as you rightly say, that was uh a basilica where uh Anglo-Saxon rulers uh were part of the upkeep. English kings and queens after that were part of the upkeep until the reformation when that stopped. So this is a recognition of uh that contribution that was made by by English kings and of course an extraordinary striking gesture indeed allem and uh the the symbolism the religious symbolism a backdrop to all of this but one can't help but but but mention also that another backdrop to this visit that I'm sure uh Buckingham Palace would prefer not to be so is the growing controversy and scandal over uh Prince Andrew and uh the growing controversy over his living arrangements on the Windsor estate and all the uh allegations of his association with the convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein which even though Buckingham Palace says of course they are completely aware of and and and you know they know that we are going to be talking about uh they will be hoping is not overshadowing this visit. Yes, I mean certainly uh it won't be overshadowing the visit necessarily from the Vatican point of view. Back at home, all eyes are on the royal family at the moment. For that reason, I think it's unlikely that Pope Leo, for example, will be drawn on the issue. He's he's very careful in what he says. We've seen uh since he was uh inaugurated as as Pope in May, he's he's been very cautious in what he says about uh political events around the world. He's really focused on working behind the scenes as a bridge. Sorry, I'm going to just interrupt you. Apologies because uh apologies Alen because we can just see the uh the car uh and the convoy of the king and queen just coming around the colonades uh of St. Peter Square and onto Via Deontat which leads up uh to the Vatican. You can see there the Italian Calabini, the military police at the front of that convoy. Uh, and then there is the king and queen. And there are the king and queen in their car with the royal standard above being followed by police vehicles as they make their way down via de la contri that effectively links Italy to the Vatican followed by uh the official cars at the end of their convoy and they will make their way across to the papal basilica uh and abbey of St. Paul's outside the walls which as Ali Mcbool our religion editor was just explaining there uh there will be also more religious symbolism there as uh King Charles is given the title royal confrata uh and uh there you can see the uh chapel uh from the uh cysteine chapel that was the moment of real unity that we have seen within the last hour the moment where uh the king and the pope prayed together the first British monarch and the pope group to to lead prayers together in five centuries."
"aUg-SL3fS1Q","US sanctions Russian oil companies after failed Putin talks | BBC News","The US has announced new sanctions targeting Russia's two largest oil companies in an effort to pressure Moscow to negotiate a peace deal in Ukraine.
 
The announcement comes one day after US President Donald Trump said a planned meeting with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin in Budapest would be shelved indefinitely.
 
""Every time I speak to Vladimir, I have good conversations and then they don't go anywhere,"" Trump said.
 
While the economic impact to Russia is likely to be minimal, it represents a major shift in Trump's foreign policy, having previously said he would not impose sanctions until European nations ceased buying Russian oil. 
 
The Kremlin said Russia was ""immune"" to the sanctions.

The Ukrainian envoy to the US said that peace could only be achieved through strength. The sanctions targeting Russia's two largest oil companies, Ros and Lucille, are the first direct financial punishment that the Trump administration has imposed on the Kremlin over its invasion. It comes after President Trump said a meeting planned with Russian President Vladimir Putin would be shelved indefinitely. Well, overnight Russia again carried out strikes on Ukraine. Several civilians were reported to be killed and injured in the capital Kev and the second largest city of Hake. Look, these are tremendous sanctions. These are very big. Those are against their two big oil companies and we hope that they won't be on for long. We hope that uh the war will be settled. Uh we just answered uh having to do with the various forms of missiles and everything else that we're looking at, but we don't think that's going to be necessary. Uh we would like to see them just take the line that has been formed over quite a long period of time and go and let's you know go home. Every time I speak with Vladimir, I have good conversations and then uh they don't go anywhere. They just don't go anywhere. So in that sense, but no, look, he's fighting a war. He's in a war. That's two very competent sides, and that's the way war is. You never know with war. But uh I would say that it's time it's time to make a deal. A lot of people are dying. Well, at a two-day gathering in Brussels, EU leaders are expected to consider loaning Ukraine more than $160 billion funded by the frozen Russian assets. The idea has been proposed by the block's foreign policy chief, Kaakalas. Speaking to the BBC's Today program, she accused Vladimir Putin of trying to play Donald Trump. Here she is. Well, the work is still ongoing, but we have made a huge step. I think uh you know what is the fundamentals of this is that our taxpayers shouldn't pay for the damages that we haven't caused. It should be Russia who pays for the damages uh that they are causing in Ukraine. And it is also clear that the assets that have been frozen that we are not giving them back to Russia before they have paid uh the damages to Ukraine and Ukraine needs them now. But you think we won't be doing another interview with me saying will it happen? You think it's going to happen? Well, you never uh really uh can say that we are there until we are there and of course we are 27 different democracies and that's why you know we discuss these things because you know what Donald Trump says and he was referring of course to oil and gas purchases by European countries. They're funding the war against themselves. He says who the hell heard of that one because the Hungarians are buying 400 million euros worth of oil and gas. The Slovakians 275 million, the French 150 million. Why? Why can't Europe just say stop? Well, uh we have said stop and we have even uh you know really decreased our um you know purchases of of oil and gas like 80%. So a lot from the start but it's true that we are still buying and not all of us but few countries uh also big friends of of President Trump. So I hope that he delivers those messages directly as well. All of this is in the context of what does Donald Trump intend to do? There's a lot of talk about a 12point plan for peace. Whose plan is it and do you think Donald Trump will own that plan eventually? Well, uh those points have been put forward all the time by the Europeans. I mean there are a lot of issues like returning the deported children. I mean paying for the reparations uh also you know the territorial integrity and and sovereignty of of Ukraine all these issues. I think we have been very vocal about those topics and now the question the big question before any peace plan is really how to put the pressure on Russia to also come to the table and be genuine. Kai Kalisa talking to Nick Robinson. U the Ukrainian president Vadimir Zalinski will be joining European leaders at this summit. We're monitoring the live shot as leaders come to talk to the press. Ukraine war very much on top of the agenda after Zalinski failed to secure that deal for Tomahawk cruise missiles from Donald Trump at their last meeting which arguably didn't go as well as they had hoped. Let's cross over to our Ukraine correspondent, James Waterhouse, who joins us in Brussels. Uh James, so a lot of anticipation ahead of this meeting as leaders gather. Uh obviously the EU always supportive of uh Zalinski. He's going to really want to hear that support today. Absolutely. I mean, what the European Union has tried to do time and time again is both pressure Russia to change course in its invasion of Ukraine. I mean its 19th round of sanctions is going to be announced today. But it's also been trying to push Donald Trump to take more direct action against the Kremlin. And the this two-day meeting of EU leaders couldn't have had a better injection of impetus after the US president announced sanctions on Russia's two biggest uh oil companies. It it it injects momentum on an agenda that is packed. Frankly, it includes housing, migration, online regulation as governments grapple with ongoing challenges. But what strikes you being here is how defense and Ukraine still dominates. We've seen the block, as you've heard there, propose uh a sizable loan for Ukraine, 120 billion pounds worth to be funded by frozen Russian assets. It's also drawing up its own road map where it's going to spend trillions on its own defense to it says be ready for a Russian invasion or acts of aggression by 2030. There are a lot of political creases to be ironed out. It's very difficult to get any kind of broad consensus on these increasingly difficult issues. But if you're President Zalinski, who so far has left Washington with nothing, as you say, with the tomahawk missiles, this is welcome news as his European friends gather around the table today."

He and the Queen are due to meet Pope Leo for the first time since he was elected. The king will become the first British monarch to pray publicly with the Pontiff since the breakaway from the Catholic Church and creation of the Church of England in the 16th century. While the visit comes as questions remain over the king's brother, Prince Andrew, and his links to the convicted sex offender, Jeffrey Epstein. The prince has always denied any wrongdoing. Our royal correspondent Daniela Lar is at the Vatican. Landing in Italy, escaping the pressures at home for a state visit to the Vatican Buckingham Palace has described as historic and hugely significant. On this trip, the king and pope will pray together in the cyine chapel. The first time a monarch and pontiff have done that in around 500 years. It will be a powerful moment of religious unity in a week when family troubles have dominated. Together at St. James's Palace this week, the king and prime minister on duty promoting British interests. But lurking in the background, questions around the Prince Andrew problem just intensify. His 30 room mansion in Windsor Great Park at the heart of political scrutiny. Mr. Speaker, given the revelations about Royal Lodge, does the prime minister agree that this house needs to properly scrutinize the crown estate to ensure taxpayers interests are protected? The chancellor herself has said that the current arrangements are wrong. So, will the prime minister support a select committee inquiry so all those involved can be called for evidence, including the current occupant? Prime Minister. Well, it's important in relation to um all properties, crown properties, that there is proper scrutiny. I certainly support that. Prince Andrew's lease for Royal Lodge was frontloaded. In 2003, he paid a million pounds to move into the property and then 7.5 million to do renovations required under the lease. The money up front meant in effect he pays no rent. Where Prince Andrew sourced that level of cash is unclear. Buckingham Palace said he now receives no money from the royal family from any source. But for the next 24 hours, the focus will shift to Vatican City. And for those attending events, this is a timely state visit for the king. Well, I think in the essence of prayer, we bring before God our weakness and troubles. And I have no doubt at all that family difficulties will be in the heart of both the pope and the king as they as he were place themselves before God and ask for grace and strength to live through all the difficulties that we all have in life. These are far from perfect circumstances in which to start a trip of this kind. But Buckingham Palace hope its message of unity and faith will make an impact. Daniela Ralph, BBC News. Well, let's show you the live scene looking out at the Vatican as King Charles prepares to arrive there for his meeting with Pope Leo. Well, let's speak to our correspondent Mark Lohan who is also at the Vatican for us. Hi, Rajie. Yes, good morning. uh on a really symbolic historic day here at the Vatican. It was it back in 1534 that King Henry VIII broke with uh Rome and set England on the path to Protestantism, created the Church of England. And then for many centuries there was real mistrust between the Church of England and the Catholic Church. In recent decades, uh there has been a warming of relations between the two wings of Christianity. And yet today will be that really that the climax of that kind of unity and and reconciliation as King Charles III becomes the first British monarch uh in five centuries to pray alongside a Catholic pope, Pope Leo I 14th inside the Systeine Chapel uh just behind me there in the splenders of Vatican City. And uh they will pray beneath the frescos of Michelangelo in the Systeine Chapel where Pope Leo himself was elected pontiff back in May. and prayer is often a very private moment. Uh so in the fact that it will be filmed by Vatican TV in itself is unusual and yet on top of that you've got this extreme extremely important symbolism of the two faiths coming together. Uh now what we're expecting this morning is before that prayer uh King Charles and Queen Camila will arrive. They will meet uh Pope Leo. It'll be their first meeting. First meeting of course of two heads of state because the pope is also head of state of the world's smallest independent state, the Vatican. Uh then uh Queen Camila will be given a tour of a of a of a chapel called the Pauline Chapel. Um and then they will go into the Systeine Chapel for that moment of prayer and then later on in the afternoon Rajini another symbolic moment as the king and queen are taken by the pope to the basilica of St. Paul outside the walls outside uh the Vatican where the king will be given a special seat engraved with his coat of arms and conferred with a title of royal confrater signifying the kind of unity and and confraternity once again between the two churches. Uh the English church traditionally was involved in the upkeep of the tomb of St. hall in that basilica and that seat can be used by King Charles and his successors in decades and centuries to come. So uh the both Buckingham Palace and the papacy very very keen to emphasize the symbolism of today. But as you heard there in Daniela's report of course looming large in the background to all of this back in the UK is the deepening scandal over Prince Andrew and Buckingham Palace very much very much hoping that the that the importance and symbolism of today is not overshadowed by that. Indeed. Mark loan in the Vatican. Thank you very much for the moment."

Lots of the survivors who were involved in advising the inquiry have withdrawn because they're not happy about how it's shaping up. And two of the people who were touted as potential chairs have withdrawn because of the criticism that they've faced. We will discuss what is going on and what it means on this episode of the BBC's daily news podcast newscast. Well, we can catch up with Chris who's at Westminster. Hello, Chris. Hi. And also our special correspondent, Judith Morris. Hi, Judith. Hi, Adam. Where are you geographically? Judith. Gloria Sulford. Okay. Oh, inside in an office for once rather than indoors. Yes, that's makes a change. Um um before we dive into the politics of of today, I just wonder Judith, where is a good place to kind of go back to for this for this story? Good question. Um well look let's start I guess by just reminding ourselves of why we are in the place we are talking about a national inquiry at all because you you remember all the back and forth about this at the start of this year. The government resisted initially a national inquiry. The plan at the beginning of the year was for there to be local inquiries, five local inquiries, but there was a a review and audit commissioned uh which was carried out by Baroness Louise Casey and as part of that she recommended that there should be a national inquiry. Now I mean this is complex um but what she said very clearly at the time was she didn't want it to look like other public inquiries. You know, there have been a raft of different inquiries in the past which touch on this subject, not least, of course, the longrunning Ixa, you know, the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse. But there's been a feeling uh widely accepted that no one's got to grips with the specific issue of grooming gangs. And when Louise Casey looked at this, she was particularly looking at whether or not enough local authorities and and regional areas were likely to take up the the idea of of local inquiries. Tony Olden put its hand up and she said I think it needs to be national but it needs to be local in inquiries which feed into a national umbrella not something which takes on the same form as uh not a judge-led inquiry necessarily but something new and you could say well maybe that now is why we are where we are because it's being fought over the terms of reference the concept of who will chair this what it'll look like how it will run. That's up for grabs. That's what's being debated and clearly people are falling out over it. And also Chris, just the politics throughout this year, the way the government was sort of justifying this and saying it wasn't a U-turn was that they put in place a process under Louise Casey that could have led to this outcome and they were just following the process and Luis Casey changed her mind about whether to have a national inquiry. So therefore it's okay for the prime minister to to change his mind. And also as Judith was saying this wasn't a repeat of the big child abuse inquiry. This is a quite targeted thing. And also I remember at the time Luis Casey saying so much of it was just about forcing different local agencies and different bits of local government to actually talk to each other in a way that a local inquiry couldn't do. Yeah. There's been a kind of arc to this political argument going back to the the beginning of the year and the prime minister's trying to make the case that he has followed a kind of logical procedure if you like even if it has taken some time with the work that Baroness Casey did earlier in the year and then that decision I remember I was with the prime minister on a plane on the way to the G7 summit in Canada when he told us middle of a Saturday afternoon I think it was that there would be um this uh statutory uh inquiry and that it I've just been looking back at my notes actually from that day, 14th of June. Setting it up will take a bit of time, he said. Well, that's definitely turned out to be the case and and then now the politics around uh around what it amounts to and who chairs it. And I'm struck, Adam, and we can talk about how it came up at Prime Minister's questions because it was the dominating exchanges between the prime minister and Kemmy Badnockley, Conservative leader. But taking half a step back from it and just reflecting on what Judith was saying, I'm struck that at the heart of this that the government is is having to wrestle and in public with the reality of the utterly bleak nature of this and the fact that at its heart are victims who have been let down in the most profound way by agencies of the state. And you now have a government attempting to grapple with this and set up an infrastructure, an inquiry that can attempt to get to some answers. But in so doing, yeah, of course, is is dealing with a a range of people who have been persistently let down. Some of whom are then now not happy with the process that's underway. and and the nature of that is then playing out in real time whilst the government is still trying to go about trying to find the right per the right person to lead it conscious that they'll want to ensure that when a decision is taken firstly as the prime minister acknowledges perhaps not everyone will be happy but that also that that person is is up for the longevity of the challenge ahead so that this isn't a recurring problem for everyone involved in this where they might have to come back and and find somebody else. Yeah, and we'll talk about the appointment of the chair in a second and also how it played out at Prime Minister's questions on Wednesday lunchtime. But first, Judith, just in terms of the the victims and survivors who've been on the panel advising during the setting up of this inquiry, we've now got a situation where well, as we're recording on Wednesday evening, four people have withdrawn from that panel, but equally a few people on the panel have come forward saying they disagree with some of the people who've withdrawn. Yeah, it's clear that there's a a division of opinion that not everybody uh has the same view that all survivors have the same view. I think that's to be expected. You know, whenever I've covered stories in the past, very different to this, but public inquiries or legal processes involving survivors and victims of of difficult situations, attacks, tragedies, whatever, you will find it's a mistake to take the the the view that everyone has the same opinion. and and I don't know whether that was perhaps a naive assumption here uh amongst officials who were looking at this you know let's take a sounding board of some views of different survivors and we should then be able to take that box and move on but certainly I've been speaking to survivors of grooming gangs over the last couple of days particularly have heard of Fiona Godard who's been very vocal she's waved her right to anonymity and she was the first person to resign uh others by the way who haven't given up their right to anonymity. And I think that is another thing to just mention here is it makes it difficult to get a sense of how many survivors at the moment are are closely plugged into this process because you know there are people who are keeping their anonymity. We don't know everybody who's involved. Some of those have come out vocally um have chosen to do that. Others are quietly, you know, getting on with it, either staying involved or perhaps not or considering pulling out. It's hard to get a a sense of the full scale. But the two issues that the sort of the division seems to be around is first of all the scope of the inquiry to use a very civil servants word like how many things and different issues this would actually look at and then yeah the personnel who's going to run it. Yeah. And I think so the scope first of all um you know if you ask me for my take on that it's it's I think when when I'm talking to these survivors they're saying look we don't understand why this is even a subject for debate because when Louise Casey recommended it she recommended it as a national inquiry into grooming gangs full stop laser focus this subject only we don't need a broadbased inquiry they say that's what I was we've been there and and there wasn't enough focus on the specific specifics of this subject. Now, why are they worrying about this being too broad brush? Well, I've seen notes that was shown to me from the agenda of one of the meetings that the survivors had as part of the panel process before this inquiry gets going, these consultation process conversations happening. And one of the questions they were being asked was, should this inquiry have an explicit focus on grooming gangs or group based CSA or should it take a broader approach? And the fact they were even being asked that question offended some of them. They felt that that was something which had already been settled by Louise Casey and her recommendation. And even if the terms of reference for this inquiry are still being hammered out, they feel that shouldn't be one of the things which is at issue. So that's why they're saying it's too broad brush. We're worrying about it. The identity of the chairperson is a whole other conversation. And there you'll know that the two prospective candidates we know about, both of whom have now withdrawn, one a former police officer, the other a former social worker. There's an an argument that there are some survivors saying that's too close to home. social services, police forces are two of the main uh agencies we know have failed. They shouldn't be providing former members of staff to chair an inquiry like this. There's other survivors who are very happy with that kind of arrangement because they feel it's relevant. It brings relevance to the process. So there's a you know that again is somewhere that people are are disagreeing. And Judith, the former police officer you referred to there was Jim Gamble, uh, who was also previously the boss of something called COP, the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Safety Center. Pops up on the news talking about these issues quite often. I've interviewed him loads of times and he was on the the news channel today and he actually had some quite harsh words for the the political system as a whole. All you have to do is is is to to scan Twitter or to watch any of the parliamentary debates on this to see the level of adversarial approaches that that that are being taken. Rather than politicians think, look, we've got the opportunity of a generation um to do the right thing for these children and young people, these survivors of this awful abuse. People are using it instead for party political point scoring opportunities. That's just not acceptable. And what it does is it misinforms and misdirects so many people and and I worry that victims and survivors who watch this are are left with a feeling that this is never going to be resolved. Yeah. So Chris, what's your take on just the politics of this today, this week, this year? It's inevitable. I think you know I'm I'm always conscious. You think of so many issues where there will be a desire perhaps that things don't become political or the politics could be taken out of it. And my instinct having kicked around this post code at Westminster for a long time is that is that the polit politics is inevitable particularly when issues are as fraught and uh inevitably lead to uh strong feelings. PMQs today dominated as I say by this issue at least the main exchanges of prime minister's questions between Kam Veno and um and Kia Star K Bok accusing the government of engaging in a briefing war against survivors um which really annoyed and I think upset some Labour front um and backbenches the prime minister acknowledging that these are the hard yards in the context of getting things up and running and you know an acknowledgement of the bumps of the last few days, but insisting that the scope won't be diluted and the inquiry won't shy away from cultural and uh religious issues and then pushing back against the claims that some have suggested that it's a um that it's a a cover up. From what I hear within government, they they know as the prime minister acknowledged publicly that this is difficult and that these are the hard yards, but that in their view getting the the casting right the first time uh is absolutely key so that this doesn't develop into something that critics could suggest was a kind of rolling mess really. uh and that if it takes some bumps at the start, it might be worth it in order to get something up and running that is um that is sort of believed and trusted and on on the particular nature of who you get uh to to run it to chair it. The prime minister pushing back against the argument that some have made including the conservatives that it should be judgeled. the prime minister uh pointing back to what Dame Louise Casey said which is that if you go down that route uh the danger is that you can't run or you're less likely to have simultaneously running police inquiries and the government I think very keen that this gets up and running by the relative speed of these things quite quickly and that you can do that uh if you have if it's not led by a judge in a way that might not happen if it if it were to be and Judith in terms of speed and trying to keep the ball rolling while they look for a permanent chair. Guess who's come back? Louise Casey. She's now going to be involved in even more in setting this thing up. So, it sort of feels like there's still some momentum. Yeah. Although not the suggestion that she would chair it and actually from the get-go when this recommendation when she made that recommendation back in June and I spoke to survivors then and said, ""Who would you like to get involved? Who do you want to chair this?"" They said, ""Louise Casey, please."" Um so you know yeah it is look there are some uncomfortable reminders here uh of IXA because you'll remember that that inquiry went through three chairwomen before the fourth professor Alexis J took the reigns nobody wants to see teething problems here of that ilk but you know normally when I cover public inquiries like the Manchester Arena inquiry the Southport attack inquiry which is running at the moment or the Fill Wall inquiry uh into the the Lucy Leppy um situation at the hospital in Chester. Those follow the same kind of path generally. You know, the inquiry is announced, the chairperson's appointed, the terms of reference is set and then although there is consultation generally with stakeholders with with victims and survivors, things get going relatively seamlessly because the parameters are well established from the beginning. They have to be before the hearings can start. this was never going to be a public inquiry in that mold. Louise Casey said she didn't want that and and so it was always I think we always expected there to be challenges. Um the question is going to be as Chris has just said, you know, can they overcome those in short order to be able to get this going underway and crucially with the confidence of the people who've been calling for it for so many years. And also Judith, just picking up on your last point there about previous inquiries. You've got to remember these are usually quite timeconsuming, painstaking things, and quite often that conflicts with the strong emotions and people's desire for for justice or a solution or an answer because they've been going through this for years, decades even. Yeah. Which is why actually uh the the case management if you like the terms of reference the structure of the thing is so critical because even if it's going to take a long time if there's focus and purpose and people can understand the rationale behind that and and see that it is proceeding if you like in the right direction you'll carry that confidence of those involved along with you. It's it's where things perhaps feel amorphous, not quite set in stone yet. Nobody quite knows how this is going to work. I think at this stage it feels that that confidence is ebbing away, but it's there to be regained. And I'm saying that actually only of course in relation to the survivors I've been speaking to who've pulled out. We mustn't forget there are others still very much on board. And so you know where are we going to net out ultimately? They need to keep the confidence of as many of those uh people as possible. Judith, thank you very much. Thanks. And Chris, thanks to you too. Cheers. Now, why we should all care about the soaring price of orange juice, although actually the signs that it might stop soaring or has stopped soaring in the last few months. Fisel Islam BBC economics editor has written a fantastic essay for the BBC in-depth section of the website where he has taken apart nay unpeeled all the reasons why we should care about this breakfast staple and fisel is on newscast down the line right now. Hello Fisel and Fisizel is here. Hello. Hello Adam. I actually read your long read on the BBC news website over breakfast. No, I don't mean I I wasn't suggesting I'd actually read it. I meant I actually read it over breakfast, but I'm not I'm not really an orange juice consumer. Okay. So, I only have it when I when I check into a hotel and I've got breakfast included. Okay. Well, that's good. Yeah. No, it's it's it's it's the fact that it's such a staple and that it's we all know what's in it. Well, kind of up to a point, but so simple that makes it quite a nice way to track inflationary pressures everywhere around the world. So, so yeah, it was it was a it was a great idea to just try and take the example of one product. And in terms of prices, what are we looking at? Oh, they've gone up hugely. I mean, everyone does notice it. And it's the sort of I don't they call it the sticker shock in the shops, but it's kind of cafe shock, the glass shock, but yeah, if you're talking about kind of standard carton, a fairly basic orange juice, well below a pound, 7080p 5 years ago, now 1.7182. So that's kind of more on double the more more sort of natural sound sort of bit bit with bits in it pure 100%. It's all different varieties and that's part of the issue. They've gone up 30 40 50% over 5 years. A lot of that has happened over the past 12 months for you know for reasons we can we will we will get into. Um but yeah yeah it's um it slightly depends on what type of orange juice but there's some common factors. Well, let's I mean there's loads of factors that we can unpick um or unpeel see as we're talking about oranges. First of all, let's talk about just the the structure of the global orange market. Why is that important here? Well, well, it really matters and it's because if you orange is such a simple product and although obviously we can't grow them here, there's a large belt of the of the center of the world uh where they can be grown because of the because of the climate. You would expect that even if it was problem problem in one particular area they'd make up for it somewhere else. Um that hasn't happened. Orange production is hugely concentrated on one country which is Brazil. That is not an accident. If you look at the history that's the result of the kind of cultivation of Brazil by the US multinationals that created the orange juice market. It was America that created, if you like, the and commoditized orange juice. And that stems back to World War II where they were specifically looking, the US kind of army scientists for ways to send out vitamin C to the troops and didn't quite make them make to them on time. But actually older newscasters will may remember or even have the kind of uh the rations. Orange was a key part of what was called welfare foods, the the creation of the welfare state in the UK. Uh but then eventually Minutemade um it commercializes it on orange juice after the war. It booms in America. It becomes part of the American dream. It becomes a health drink. It becomes particularly fed to children. Uh and in particular they cultivate Brazil. They develop Brazil as the market to to as as as the source to to essentially serve the market in the US and it goes global. And now though that started to reverse as people question the health benefits in terms of the amount of sugar. But in areas of the developing world that are becoming more middle class and having breakfast and want to feel in their way sophisticated with a bit of consumption is going up. Whereas in areas of the developed world where they're thinking about sugar levels it's going down. Actually in UK it's still going up. Um, so that's so so so that's the that's the broad structure of the market, but it's very concentrated on Brazil, very dependent on Brazil. And in Brazil, there's been this disease called citrus greening that's taken out in some parts, twothirds, not taken out, it's kind of greatly reduced the crop in two/irds of the trees. And then on top of that, you've had huracans and the effects of climate change and production in Florida, which is the home of this stuff, uh, down at Great Depression levels. And there's a bit of a Trump trade tariff angle. There is that has complicated matters and it kind of goes in different directions on different days. Uh clearly the Canadians saw orange juice as a sort of seinal toemic product that they could hit back on. Justin Trudeau, the former prime minister, said we're going to have to get used to not drinking so much Florida orange juice. They slapped a big tariff on it. In any event, the tar even maybe before the tariff, demand for Florida orange juice went down in Canada as a sort of patriotic kind of push. Um, they also tried to use it against Brazil. But this is interesting because it shows the limits of this. Uh, they were going to put 50% on everything from Brazil because of some of the problems that Donald Trump has with the Brazilian government, the leftwing government in Brazil. um but they couldn't do in the end because it would have been so femininal, so tomic on the American breakfast table had this tariff been passed through and it ended up being 10%. But that's also played havoc with the price which has fed through eventually into the supermarket shelf prices that we discussed before. And then there's just how the price rises are passed on to us the consumer because it's not a straight line from the increasing cost of the raw materials to increasing cost on the shelf. Absolutely. Um and so and it raises questions about the stickiness of prices. So I described it run up hugely. It has actually fallen back now as the crop in Brazil does okay. That has not filtered through into the shops. There's two or three reasons for that. Firstly, they uh it's just and you have to talk to people actually buying the product at this point. The graphs don't do it justice. And they talk about the panic of trying to buy this orange and get it out of Brazil and there wasn't enough in Brazil and they paid the top dollar. Even though it went up to, you know, to the equivalent of $5 per per kilo, uh, which is normally one to two, they were paying seven because they just needed it. They can't not have it. And they couldn't get it out of Florida. So you have the So what did they do? They stockpiled this frozen stuff because they take the water out, they freeze it, they send it around the world in big green drums. Who knew? um and then uh they couldn't take it and then they have to use it. They have to use all that stuff they paid seven bucks for. So So that's a factor. Then then you have to you know the the supermarkets maybe held their prices when they were paying more and now they maybe need to make some of that back. Maybe the in general uh the consumer has got used to paying two pound and not one pound for basic orange juice4 and not three pound for pure orange juice. And if you're a producer, you think maybe I should accommodate this new price point rather than wind things back to where they are. So what you're seeing is uh different blends. You're seeing different sizes. You're seeing a sort of try a reinvigoration of it as an attempted health drink. And in particular, and I didn't notice this until I noticed it really. I thought the proliferation of like orange with apple, orange with mandarin, orange with clementine. I just thought that was like being cool, like flavors, but it's like totally economic. Oh, everything's economic, Adam. But like this is even more economic. It It's a cheaper way of getting the same level of sweetness because I think people might notice I'm interested to know what you guys think that the sort of average normal plain orange juice is is less sweet than you may have remembered three or four years ago. And that's a direct result of some of the factors that we that we've seen. And also you hinted at this earlier in the conversation that actually there's a generation of people and also just various groups of people who are a bit more skeptical of the health benefits of orange juice and so that changes the the the the market as well. Yeah. So back in the day around the second world war when this was developed they were trying to fight scurvy and it was vitamin C and that was the that was the genius sort of medicine that you drank that was also fulfilling. Now, of course, sugar, obesity, there's been a backlash and in particular, uh, kids that maybe 25 years ago would have ordinarily had orange juice every morning at breakfast aren't getting it for health reasons and so are not developing a habit. It's so interesting though because I've just made a note of all the factors that contribute to the the price changes of just one product. And you've and basically you've gone through the structure of the market for the commodity globally. Then like external biological factors like whether there's a a disease or an earthquake or a flood or a fire somewhere that affects the the raw materials. Then you've got the trade policy of individual countries particularly America. Then you've got the factors in the shop like how much are they also having to pay on I don't know increased national insurance contributions for their staff and how much product have they got. Then you've got how the producers are dealing with it and actually do they have stuff they have to get rid of or stuff they have to replace. And then you've just got the fact that we're in a giant global market now. And so the tastes of the middle classes in India and China have an impact on what products we have in the shelves in the UK and how much those products cost. That's kind of like six things that then get boiled down to one number which is the inflation in one particular food item. No, absolutely. And we see similar things in other commodities. And I think the general thing for me is is is like why now that the global market price has fallen not quite the pattern we're seeing is we've seen a big run up in commodities prices uh partly during the pandemic and and after the lockdown obviously during the energy crisis and then a bit more over the past year and in many cases that has fallen back. We've seen that in things like cocoa. We've seen that in other areas but the prices are not adjusting. So people quite rightly at home are thinking are we going to get back to normal and I'm trying to explain why some reasons why they have not that said I think there's a reasonable argument now are we getting to the point now with retailers and with the supermarkets where customers will start to question well hang on you should really be passing on some of these price changes back to us so we can feel it in our pockets. It may just be and and as it happens, the food price inflation numbers did come down a bit more than expected this morning. They're still they're still pretty high, but they have come down. Having just said like there are loads of factors about why you shouldn't just boil things down to one number. I mean, we have boiled things down into one number today in in the world of journalism and politics which is the inflation number which is 3.8% according to the office for national statistics. So, it's kind of lower than people were expecting this month and there's consequences of that. But I mean it is means that prices are still going up by on average 3.8%. Yeah. So so that what place is it in that's not great. It's double nearly double the target. It's higher than the G7 peers. It's not where you'd want it to be. What but the markets factor all that in already, right? And then you're like what's the direction of travel now? And so a surprise even what would appear to be a modest surprise. So we thought it would go to 4% or above. That was the expectation and it stayed at 3.8%. 8% has people questioning the dominant narrative and the dominant narrative that had emerged over the past couple of weeks is the UK is starting to look like an outlier on inflation and there's maybe something pro problematic in the stickiness of the economy is it that the tax rises have been passed on is it you know what is it there do we have to treat Britain differently and I think this starts to say well okay maybe we don't maybe there was just a bit of a bump maybe this is all going to be um okay okay you know so a market is just a bunch of opinions which fight against each other and so that one today seems to be a bit more dominant and the expression of that I would say the proof point here is that the markets are now starting to think actually the inflation outlook is going to go down from here food prices they say may well have peaked now food price inflation sorry and therefore the bank of England now having oomed and aed the markets over whe this is going to happen might just have the space for a further rate cut this this year that Andrew Bailey might attempted to dawn his Santa hat and give a rate cut to the country in in December. And that in turn, something we've talked about loads, uh, Adam, has led the market rates for government borrowing to continue their their downward fall in in a way that like, you know, is is now notable. Oh, and just before I let you go, another food related news story today, which is that penguin biscuits, they can't call them chocolate covered anymore. Yeah. Well, this is and I know you've been at the dentist recently, so maybe this is not the most appropriate orange juice to start and then a chocolate chocolate flavored biscuit to end, but I have I have been at the dentist. This is true. Um the um so this is if you like inflation, hidden inflation expresses itself in the size of the the size of your goods, but also now in the labeling of the goods. And in this case, cocoa prices have spiraled. I think from something like $3,000 up to 112,000 per or I've forgotten which metric unit it is now, but like anyway, uh the chart is extraordinary. And I think it was more expensive than copper and and crude oil at one point uh per per gram. It's fallen back again. It's halfved. It's still much higher than than it was. And the net result is how they respond to that the manufacturers is they cook cut the cocoa content and they've cut it below the threshold for what counts as chocolate which I think is 20 to 25% and it depends Brexit whether we're in the UK or the EU but like so yeah so it doesn't count as chocolate and it's now chocolate flavored. These conversations always remind me of the time I bought a jar of cinnamon in the corner shop and I dropped it on the way home and I just thought if I was a medieval spice merchant, my entire business would have been destroyed by this jar of cinnamon falling on the floor and only half of it fell out. And then I stopped in another shop on the way home and bought a tiny little jar to decant what was left into, thinking that I've probably saved millions per ton. No, you're sounding like me in pine nuts. Pine nuts. We were my my I was trying to my my uh my other half was trying to make some pesto and said we need to buy some pine nuts and I couldn't it was like it was I it didn't make sense making the pesto. The pine nuts are like they they're like little golden nuggets. They're extremely expensive. So anyway, there's a there's a top cooking tip as well as an economic tip. I'm feeling a whole new newscast basket of goods coming on. Pine nuts, cinnamon, uh, chocolate flavored drinks, biscuits, chocolate orange, uh, orange concentrate, orange not concentrate. Anyway, Fisel, thank you very much. Great to see you. And that's all for this episode of Newscast. Thank you very much for listening. We'll be back with another one very soon. Bye-bye."

The Guardian newspaper reported that the man claimed to have been been a victim of modern slavery at the hands of smuggling gangs in France.

The Home Office declined to directly confirm the report but said a migrant had been detained and their removal was being sought as soon as possible.
 
Forty two people who arrived in the UK illegally have been removed so far under the scheme in which the UK agrees to take in asylum seekers who have a case for protection.

The BBC understands that the man, who is an Iranian national, first arrived in the UK in August. He was sent back to France in September, but then came back across the channel 4 days ago. Andrew Harding has the story. The man, reportedly an Iranian national, first came to Britain from France earlier this summer on a small boat. Weeks later, he was on his way back by plane to Paris. An early and clearly reluctant participant in the government's one-in, one-out scheme in central Paris. The man and others like him were accommodated at this temporary shelter. We've obtained photos of their dormatory. But now news today that the man has fled France and returned reportedly on another small boat to the UK. Whilst he was in France, he experienced horrendous treatment at the hands of people who are organizing journeys to the UK. And in France, he was not receiving protection and feared that those individuals may well continue with that horrendous treatment that he previously experienced. In Paris, we've met others removed from Britain under the same scheme. Some, like this young Eratrayan man, say they have relatives in the UK, that they've been treated unfairly. Some of my friends were accepted by the UK government and given documents, but not you. But not me. And do you have any idea why not you? I don't know. I didn't do anything. I have no criminal record. I want to be safe. Many in similar situations end up on the streets here, trapped by bureaucratic delays, unable to work legally. Critics of Britain's oneinout scheme claim it's a lottery. Until now, nobody has been able to understand why this one and not this one. It seems completely arbitrary and I think it's also a matter of chance.

The cross-channel rail operator has confirmed it will order up to 50 trains from manufacturer Alstom, eventually increasing the size of its fleet by nearly a third.

The expansion plans would include investing heavily in a crucial London depot, it said.

But questions remain over whether the facility has enough space for both Eurostar and potential rival operators to use it.

It's placed an order for up to 50 trains from manufacturer Ol, which would increase the size of its fleet by nearly a third. A 400 meter long train would have more than a thousand seats. Euroar expects the first trains to run between London and Paris in 2031. My colleague Tag Enight caught up with the CEO of Euro Star Gwendelin Kasnv and asked her first why the company decided to introduce these double-decker trains. It's more trains for Euro Star, more seats and more destinations, more seats. For instance, between London and Paris, we're going to add three frequencies with these new trains. and it's going to be 2 million seats per year added to the seats we have today. So, it's a big big capacity improvement between London and Paris. Double decka obviously it's more comfort uh more uh a very special experience because these trains are going to be bespoke designed for our customers. So, it's a very new new experience for our customers. I think lots of people will have been surprised by this announcement because they assumed that the tunnel was too small for these trains. Why haven't you done it sooner? Ah, because that's a very good question. Now, you know, when when when uh when we we we built the new Euro Star strategy and we we we managed we thought about the project to face the demand because international demand is really growing in the UK and from the UK to continental Europe. We thought, okay, we need to consider having big capacity trains. And these big capacity trains obviously are double-decker. And these double double decker on the Alam platform uh are able I mean in terms of size to cross the channel tunnel and to run on obviously the UK networks, but also French, Belgium, Dutch, German and Swiss network. So that's why now we've been able to uh to order double-decker trains for for Euro Star. You're going to be facing more competition within the tunnel itself. And some are concerned that by putting on these double-decker trains, the new capacity, the new depots that might be needed to accommodate them, that you could undermine the ability for competitors to operate. What do you say to that? There are operators uh asking uh to uh uh to uh to operate to St. pancra station to depot to have you know all the setup and the industrial and service uh setup to be able to operate and uh there's no Euroar has no I would say is is not the one to decide what is going to come in the global competitive landscape our our job our purpose our perspective and our strategy is to be here to serve our customers"

But the king's visit is likely to be overshadowed by the ongoing scandal surrounding his brother Prince Andrew. As our correspondent Graeme Satchel now reports, the Vatican in Rome, home to the new pope, Pope Leo, elected earlier this year. It'll be the backdrop to an historic meeting almost 500 years in the making. Later today, King Charles, head of the Church of England, will start a two-day visit to Rome. It'll be the first time since Henry VIII broke with the Catholic Church in 1534 that the King of England and the Pope will meet and pray together. A spokesperson for Buckingham Palace said the visit will mark a significant moment in relations between the Catholic Church and the Church of England. It'll be the first state visit since the Reformation where the pope and the monarch will pray together in an ecumenical service. The visit and the key moment when the two men are in the cysteine chapel tomorrow is the clearest sign yet of the warming relationship between two branches of Christianity at loggerheads for centuries. And yet the visit is likely to be overshadowed by the widening controversy around the king's brother. Prince Andrew continues to be caught up in allegations surrounding his friendship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. A book published by Virginia Grey repeats the claim that she was forced to have sex with Prince Andrew on three separate occasions which he denies. There are renewed questions about Prince Andrew's finances and living arrangements. He's lived here at the Royal Lodge in Windsor for more than 20 years. Under the terms of an agreement with the Crown Estate, Prince Andrew paid a million pounds for the lease. The details show he doesn't pay annual rent, but he did spend £75 million for renovations. He's liable to pay what's called a peppercorn rent, a small fee that's usually not collected. My concern is that it was a very cozy arrangement. This is crown property that was only offered to him and not to the wider market. I mean, he says he's a man of honor. He's going to put the family, sorry, the the the country and the monarchy first, but he's not showing any evidence of that. In what feels like something of a tipping point, both the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats are now calling for Prince Andrew to pay his own way and even to become a private citizen. King Charles will be hoping to take control of the narrative with his reconciliatory trip to Rome, but pressure is mounting on the king to take firmer action against his brother. Graeme Satchel, BBC News. And we've been listening to Prime Minister's questions here in London over the past few hours. And the Prime Minister, Karmama, has said he will support a committee of inquiry into the arrangements around the lease of Royal Lodge and an appearance by Prince Andrew, its current occupant, as we've been hearing, to give evidence."

"Un7uGz_zqeQ","Uganda bus crash leaves more than 40 dead | BBC News","Forty-six people have been killed after several vehicles crashed on a major highway in Uganda, the police say.
 
The police revised down an earlier death toll of 63, saying they had mistakenly included victims who were unconscious and were now being treated.
 
The crash occurred when two buses travelling in opposite directions ""met head on"" while trying to overtake two other vehicles – a lorry and a car – on the Kampala-Gulu Highway, the Uganda Police Force said.
 
One of the buses swerved in an attempt to avoid a crash, but in the process caused a ""head on and side collision"" that led to a ""chain reaction"" in which other vehicles lost control and overturned.

Dr. Ted Ross Adenom Gabrias told the BBC that a massive increase in aid is needed to begin to address its population's complex needs. The WHO chief also said that aid should not be weaponized. He called on Israel not to impose conditions on its delivery. Let's have a listen to part of that interview. there should be uh full access uh and there should not be any any condition especially after all the living hostages were released and a good part of the remains are are transferred I didn't expect that there would be additional restrictions could the international community and in particular the US be doing more to make sure that that happens I think a followup of what has been agreed will be veryant important and since the US has brokered the peace deal, it had the responsibility of making sure that um you know the um all sides are uh respecting the deal and and um you know doing as as per as per the deal. So US has of course responsibility in this. Well, all of this comes as the US Vice President JD Vance has been meeting Israel's prime minister to discuss the next steps in the Gaza ceasefire deal. JD Vance has been pressing Benjamin Netanyahu and other Israeli leaders to make what's been described as difficult concessions over Gaza. Washington wants progress on setting up an international stabilization force and a new governing body for Gaza. Well, in the last few minutes, both men have been speaking. So, let's have a listen to what they've been saying. Few days ago, we had a historic visit by President Trump that will be edged in the annals of our nation's history. We're fortunate today to have a visit by Vice President JD Vance. Uh, and I want to tell you a few things about that. First, in the last year, we've had an unmatched alliance and partnership with the United States that is changing the Middle East, and it's also changing the world. It creates opportunities not only for security, but for the expansion of peace, which we're working on very very diligently. Uh, and it's it's just unmatched. I've been here a few years. You know, I've been through several administrations. I welcome the partnership and the assistance we've had, but there's never been anything like that. And President Trump said that it's like a partnership that's never never happened before. Well, that includes a closed circle both on our side and on the American side. And President Trump knows who he picks for that circle. One of the members, to put it mildly, is a vice president. We've had the opportunity to make decisions jointly in a very uh tight-knit and trusting partnership. And I was impressed. I was impressed with uh I was impressed with your clarity, with your incisiveness, with your solidarity for our common cause and the u just a genuine friendship that uh uh I saw in both in our conference meetings but also in our private meetings. And it's in that spirit that I very much welcome you to Jerusalem in these uh days of destiny. We're changing the face of the Middle East. Uh and uh I have to say uh I was going to say, you know, bring your family u next year in Jerusalem, but welcome this year in Jerusalem. Our great friend JD Vance. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Prime Minister, and thanks to your entire team for your hospitality and for having us. Uh as the prime minister said, these are days of destiny and uh we're very excited to sit down and work together on the Gaza peace plan. We have a very very tough task ahead of us, which is to disarm Hamas, but rebuild Gaza to make uh life better for the people in Gaza, but also to ensure that Hamas is no longer a threat to our friends in Israel. Uh that's not easy. I think the prime minister knows that as well as anybody, but it's something that we're committed to in the Trump administration. And I think that we've even in the past 24 hours had a lot of good conversations with our friends in the Israeli government, but also frankly with our friends in the Arab world who are stepping up and volunteering to play a very positive role in this. So, we're going to keep working at it. I didn't know what to expect honestly. I know the president was here a week ago to welcome the hostages home and actually sign the deal a week into it. There's a lot of work to do, but I feel very optimistic about where we are. So, thank you for the partnership. Uh thanks for your willingness to continue to work on this and I think we're going to do great things here. It's not going to be easy. I know that there are some folks in the media who I think are rooting against uh this this proposal, but I think that we have an opportunity to do something really historic. So, we're going to keep working at it uh with all all of our friends in the Israeli government. So, thank you so much for having us. Thank you. Yeah, Mr. Mr. A handshake there between the Israeli prime minister and the US Vice President JD Vance. JD Vance is in Israel on a short visit. Um and uh we heard there that he felt very optimistic about the ceasefire in Gaza, holding on despite of course at the weekend some challenges"

At least six people were killed in Ukraine, including a six-month-old baby and a 12-year-old girl in Kev. A number of residential buildings were damaged in the capital, and there were power outages in parts of the city. Ukraine's energy ministry said Russia's been attacking the country's energy infrastructure all night. The Ukrainian military meanwhile says it struck a chemical plant in the Bryants region of southern Russia using Franco British air launch storm shadow missiles. It described the site as vital to Moscow's war effort. Russia hasn't commented. While the Kremlin's been warning the West not to give Ukraine weapons capable of long range attacks, but Kee says it's imperative to target Russian facilities which play a key role in Moscow's war against Ukraine. All of this comes as the White House has rode back on plans for a summit between Presidents Trump and Putin aimed at ending the war in Ukraine. The US president said he didn't want to have a wasted meeting. The two leaders had agreed to meet it for face-to-face talks in Hungary, but a White House official said there are now no plans for a summit soon. President Trump was asked by reporters why the meeting had been shelved with the president indicating that Moscow's refusal to cease fighting along the current front line was a sticking point. Let's have a listen. I said go to the line. Go to the line of uh battle the battlefield lines and you pull back and you go home and everybody take some time off because you got two countries that are killing each other. Two countries are losing 5 to 7,000 soldiers a week. So we'll see what happens. It's we haven't made a determination. President Trump speaking there. Well, let's go straight to Kev and join my colleague John Sardworth who is there for us. John, first of all, just bring us up to date about what's been happening where you are. And of course, there's also been um attacks on the other side as well. Yes. Yes. Well, this city, Regini, once again, e echoing to the sound of explosions with uh ballistic missile warnings in place throughout the night and across the wider country. Attacks on uh other cities targeting energy infrastructure once again. And uh I can tell you also that we're just getting reports from Khib uh of a Russian strike on a kindergarten. Uh reports that uh the children are being evacuated. Obviously deep concern about the possibility of injuries. Uh waiting still for confirmation of that. Ukraine will say that there is no coincidence in any of this. These attacks come, of course, just a few hours after that announcement from the White House that President Trump's hoped for summit with Vladimir Putin in Budapest was now being put on hold. Ukraine has said all along it does not believe Moscow is serious about peace. It believes uh its talk of engaging in that summit was simply a ruse, calling President Trump's bluff in order to persuade him not to supply Ukraine with the long range Tomahawk missiles. it was seeking and I think President Zalinski will say uh you know those warnings have come to pass over the over the last 12 hours or so uh showing full well that uh Moscow uh is not interested in negotiating in good faith as you say Ukraine striking Russian targets too uh hitting uh that chemical plant which it says is part of Moscow's military machine and uh John you talk about of course that meeting that for the for moment is stalled. Um it comes after that tense meeting between President Zalinsky and President Trump in the White House just last Friday. Um you touched on it already, but is the sense that diplomatic efforts are really hitting a roadblock um even though they have for many months. Well, that's the big question now, Reini. Of course, I mean, Ukraine certainly felt very worried after uh the Trump Putin phone call on Friday and then that pretty harsh reception that they reportedly got in the White House. Um, you know, uh, questions as to whether this feeling that Washington was running out of patience with Moscow uh was misplaced and in fact Mr. Trump was swinging back the other way. uh you know if if Washington's interpretation here is that Moscow was calling his bluff and certainly the the the noises coming out of the Kremlin suggest that they have no interest in President Trump's peace plan. What does President Trump do now? Does he uh reconsider supplying Ukraine with those Tomahawk missiles? Does he impose as he's promised before uh a punishment on Moscow or does he yet again give Vladimir Putin a second chance? Ukraine is of course waiting to hear. Meanwhile, uh you know, it its focus is on shoring up uh its uh allegiances with its uh you know, European friends with big meetings planned tomorrow and Friday. Indeed. And of course, all of this comes as the bitter winter in Ukraine approaches as well. Thank you very much for uh speaking to us there from Kev, John Sudworth."

It comes after the revelation that he pays a token amount of rent every year in return for having paid millions of pounds to refurbish it when he first moved in. We will discuss what's going on in this latest episode of the BBC's daily news podcast, Newscast. Hello, it's Adam in the newscast studio and shortly I'll be joined by my colleagues who spent hours watching Boris Johnson, the former prime minister at the co inquiry where he was asked questions about his decision-making about children and young people and schools during the pandemic. But first of all, the questions have continued for Prince Andrew today as recording this episode of Newscast on Tuesday evening. And a lot of them are around his living arrangements and where he lives, the Royal Lodge, the 30-bedroom mansion in Windsor Great Park because some details have emerged of the lease that he has for that property. Also continuing the political criticism which is taking lots of different forms and coming from new places all the time. The person who's been watching it all unfold throughout Tuesday is our politics and investigations correspondent Joe Pike. and I spoke to him in the other studio a little bit earlier on. Well, let's speak now to Joe Pike, who's our politics and investigations correspondent. Hello, Joe. Hello, Adam. You've actually been covering this all weekend, haven't you? I have. Yes, a lot of it. Um, so where have we got to today? Where should we start? I think we probably should start with Royal Lodge. Uh this revelation uh from the Times newspaper, which actually was in some um government documents a couple of decades ago, but is still significant that Prince Andrew is living in Royal Lodge, this 30 room grade two-listed mansion um in Windsor Great Park for Peppercorn rent. So effectively paying nothing for it. that has prompted quite a significant political reaction. But we should probably point out he he did pay up front 7.5 million pounds to refurbish this uh this property. It's in the midst of Windsor Great Park. It has the Royal Chapel in its grounds. There are always security concerns about leasing it to to somebody else because it's it's it's listed. You couldn't exactly turn it into a hotel. And certainly a couple of decades ago, the National Audit Office looked into this arrangement, a lease between uh the then Duke of York uh Prince Andrew and the Crown Estate, which is a sort of big uh national property company looking after the sovereign's public wealth. And the national audit office said that actually this arrangement was value for money and that uh effectively the public purse got its money's worth from the fact that that Prince Andrew had spent many millions refurbishing it and of course he pays for its upkeep very regularly too. So the idea being that paying for it to be refurbished and a bit on top was kind of in lie of I don't know 50 years worth of rent. Exactly. and it's very difficult to uh rent it out. And certainly the lease does say uh for example that he needs to ensure the exterior stonework is in a good condition every 5 years. He needs to paint the interior every seven years. He needs to allow his landlords to inspect it, making sure he's keeping up the lease. Unclear whether they have been inspecting it. Also interesting, Adam, no helicopters and no gambling on the premises. Well, I mean, we all have conditions in our leases for our properties, don't we? Uh I'm not sure if there's a helicopter clause in in mine. Um and I suppose what is uh eye opening about this is even though some of this information or maybe all of it in various forms was in the public domain, what was kind of in the public domain in people's minds was that he was paying about £200,000 a year of rent. Yeah. And I suppose I I suppose if you take a step back, we thought this man had lost his royal role. He was no longer a working royal. He's not allowed to use uh his titles. And yet he is living in this pretty uh palatial home seemingly sort of at the taxpayers expense. As I've explained, it's not quite as simple as that. But certainly the lifestyle he is currently being allowed to have on a property that is owned effectively by all of us has raised a lot of eyebrows and led to I think quite a significant shift in the political reaction because normally politicians don't uh get involved at all in royal matters but in recent days Adam we've seen a bit of a shift there. Oh yeah and Rachel Reeves the chancellor has just been talking at an investment summit hasn't she? She has and she spoke to obviously not about this but she was asked about this. Yeah. She she uh spoke to one of our colleagues from BBC Midlands today and I think what was not surprising is that she followed what other government ministers have done in recent days which is to effectively swerve the issue. She certainly did not want to comment on the sort of royal lodge matter saying she's not seen the details. I can't comment on them. I just don't know the details. But she was asked about uh Prince Andrew in the context of Virginia Guprey's book. Virginia Duprey being the most prominent of Jeffrey Epstein's accusers who ended her own life in April of this year and who uh today Tuesday uh her memoir uh was published some new information in that. And Rachel Reed said I think that the most striking line she said Prince Andrew shouldn't have been associated with a convicted pedophile. Now that may not be surprising that that's her view, Adam. Uh, however, it is a step away from what other government ministers have been doing uh in recent days, which is to completely swerve the issue and say all of this is a matter for Buckingham Palace. And here is how Rachel Reeves said that he shouldn't have been associated with a convicted um uh pedophile. And I think the new revelations in this book uh you know make for very sober um uh reading. And I um I I'm sure that um you know everybody will reflect on that and and form their own judgment. And then let's get some other reaction. Here is Robert Genrich uh using some quite strong language on BBC Breakfast. He has behaved disgracefully. He's embarrassed the royal family time and again. He should really now leave public life forever. stop having any subsidy from the taxpayer whatsoever and go and lead an entirely private life. The public are sick of Prince Andrew. Okay, Joe, what's your take on that? I don't mean he used strong language like swearing, but strong language in terms of his opinion about what should happen. What jumped out at me, Adam? Behave disgracefully, embarrass the royal family. The public are sick of him. And also that that that push it's not quite clear what he means by it for Prince Andrew to stop having any subsidy from the taxpayer. Does he mean move out of royal lodge? It is it is unclear. But the Conservative party as their name would suggest don't normally uh speak about the royal family. Certainly not criticize a member of it. That is absolutely not what Robert Gener is doing today. Although I've spoken to some of Kemmy Benox see and they're very clear that the party's position is that this is a matter for the royal family. Added to that a couple of days ago the S&P's leader in Westminster, Steven Flynn, uh called for uh Prince Andrew's titles, his his duke to be legally removed. He may have sort of set them aside and agreed last Friday he won't use them, but they are given to him and exist in law and therefore it would require law, although not much law to uh officially remove them. The S&P calling from that and also very strong language from the Liberal Democrats too. This is a statement rather than a clip, but their cabinet office uh spokesperson has said Prince Andrew has failed our king and royal family and betrayed the values of the British people. Uh the longer this whole saga goes on, the more his presence in public life is an insult and increasingly an embarrassment. And here's the key thing about Royal Lodge. He should show some contrition by returning every penny of rent that he's not paid while disgracing his office. I'm not quite sure what they're calling for there, Adam. Are they calling for sort of back rent for the last How do you return something you've not paid? Exactly. That seems like something that's not going to happen. But interesting, you've got two opposition politicians, one the party of the Lib Dems and then a prominent conservative Robert Denrich calling for a shift in the Royal Lodge situation. I'm not sure this moves us on from the situation we were in yesterday where it would require quite a big heave by opponents of Prince Andrew to force the government into doing something. I agree. I think all of this as ever comes down to ultimately the uh the king deciding Buckingham Palace deciding something needs to to happen and uh that being agreed with the with the prime minister. Of course, we never hear about those private conversations between prime ministers and monarchs. But it it seems certainly unlikely the government will do anything. That doesn't though mean there isn't something really striking and unusual about suddenly over a matter of days prominent opposition politicians being vocally strikingly critical of a member of the royal family. That is that is pretty new. Um especially I think with the Lib Dems when you consider how positive Ed Davyy the leader of that party is about the king. And I think even if this doesn't change things, it will have been uh heard in uh Buckingham Palace. And of course the question the palace are constantly facing is how do we finally draw a line under this? And certainly they've struggled to do that over a number of years. Well, yeah, because every time they draw a line, it turns out there's a new line. Absolutely. Absolutely. And also um even though Prince Andrew has lost a lot including his royal position and his patronages and his military titles in law he is still um the Duke of York. He is still uh a prince. uh that could all change and certainly constitutional experts have slightly gone against what uh palace sources seem to be saying that actually it wouldn't be very difficult for parliament to uh to change that to make sort of amendments in law because so much of this is in legislation and legislation from many decades ago. Uh so it could be done quite quickly without much debate because certainly MPs by convention are not really allowed to discuss the royal family in the in the House of Commons. Um there doesn't seem any sign that it's happening yet, but I suppose it it could happen quickly and it depends whether others feel that they are emboldened after these these interventions over the last two or three days. I can totally imagine a either like an old-timer backbencher who's always hated this convention and also doesn't think it's quite as strong a convention as other people do mentioning this at PMQ's tomorrow to get maximum publicity or maybe a new generation MP um who just thinks it's all really old-fashioned. Absolutely. I think that is very very possible. I was trying to work out in my head whether whether Ben would want to talk about this as one of her six questions on Wednesday. I think that's probably unlikely. Certainly if the Conservative Party official statement is kind of shutting down Robert Jenrich that suggests no. Exactly. That that was that was my thought. But you I think you're right that others could voice it. And partly I suppose what this comes down to is that even though partly this is about um royalty and the monarchy, it is also even though Prince Andrew of course has consistently denied all these allegations about victims and survivors. And certainly one thing that government ministers have said and uh other opposition parties have said in recent days is that we need to think about um about survivors and victims of Jeffrey Epstein and Gillen Maxwell. And ultimately I suppose this whole row over Prince Andrew over many years does come back to the question over the company you keep. And even though he has denied wrongdoing, we we do know that two of his close friends for quite a long time are people we now know to be a a prolific convicted pedophile and also a convicted sex trafficker. Also, I think one of the really interesting things um that that has emerged today was Baroness Kennedy, Helena Kennedy, Labour Pier on the Today program at about 20 past 8 floating this idea of of Andrew moving to Switzerland and sort of insinuating that maybe that might be the king's preferred option for this and okay that sounds quite speculative and of course people have said oh in the past royals have gone and lived in other countries when they've proved to be a big problem. But what I think is interesting about that is she I think is quite pi with the king and also she set up the chambers that Kier Starmer was a barristister in. So that reflects a certain kind of stratum of opinion about what should happen to Prince Andrew which I think is fascinating that she sort of put that out there in the open. That is absolutely fascinating. And I suppose the most uh prominent historical example would be the Duke of Windsor uh Edward VII who of course abdicated um so he could be with a woman he loved. Certainly the story um of his life after he was king is pretty sort of sad, depressing, controversial at points, but clearly the monarchy do not want and it's been reported for for quite a long time they do not want Andrew in this mansion royal lodge in in Windsor Great Park. I suppose the danger with with uh him him really being sort of outside the tent is that can cause problems too. Now you're not it would be strange to think that he would uh pursue sort of media interventions like Prince Harry has. But certainly I think there are advantages and maybe this is felt partly uh in royal circles. sort of no evidence of it of keeping somebody like um Prince Andrew close at hand. Partly so you know what he's getting up to, but also um there is an element that the the royal family seem to have great fondness for his his two daughters and uh their continuing role. Joe, thank you very much. Thanks, Adam. Now, as promised, we're going back down memory lane because that's what the co inquiry were doing today when they were quizzing Boris Johnson, former prime minister, for several hours for their eighth module of their inquiry, which is all about how government decision-m affected children and young people with a big focus on the decisions in 2020 and 2021 to close schools for quite long periods of time. Two of my ace colleagues have been watching all his hours of testimony and they're here in the newscast studio. Please welcome education editor Bramman Jeff. Hi Bramman. Hello. And Ben Shu from BBC Verify. Hello. Hello Adam. Um first of all before we we dig into the evidence just what how did it feel for you guys watching it? Because I used to love talking about COVID and government policy and the ins and outs of it. I'm not sure I love it quite so much now. Do you know I lived and breathed it at the time because I was on the phone or on people's doorsteps or in schools and colleges the whole time. So, it was an extraordinary day to see it now being unpicked. And I think there's a real generational piece here. When you talk to anyone who who's under 25, 26, it came at such a big time in their life. Absolutely massive points of transition, not just in education, but in their social development, their friendships, and it still really matters. Yeah. And Ben, it's it's interesting going from the days where we knew all the decisions and the dates and the documents that were floating around almost like the backs of our hands and now it feels like ancient history. Yeah. Well, I think a lot of us have tried to blot out that period because it was so traumatic in many ways. I mean, my biggest memory today watching the evidence was actually homeschooling in that period in March and April in 2020. And it was I had two primary school age children um just trying to find the laptops trying to navigate the teaching aids. It was very very stressful and obviously trying to do your job at the same time. So very big consequences of those decisions made at that time and I lived through it and I felt it and you know we were relatively privileged because we had a laptop two laptops knocking about the house. Imagine if you didn't imagine trying to do it on a phone or without broadband. I mean it was it was a very very tough time. And Braman, just in terms of the processology, this is module eight of the CO inquiry and its focuses entirely on the stuff we've just been talking about there. That's exactly it. It focuses on what happened to anyone who was under 18 at the time. So, children from the smallest babies to to young adults effectively. And it concludes its evidence uh at the end of this week. Um this was probably Boris Johnson's last appearance at the inquiry, so very significant. He was there today, which is his second overall. His second overall. Um, and we may not get the report from this module until some way through next year because they're publishing them bit by bit. Um, lots to discuss. Let's listen to an early bit of Boris Johnson's evidence where he's being asked by the KC about the initial decision to shut schools in mid-March 2020. School closures were clearly going to be part of the the paniply of things that we might be able to do to to defeat COVID. I I wanted to keep it to the very very last. It was something that I thought was a and I say in my a terrible thing to do and would have awful consequences for for young people particularly those who were u least able to cope. Yeah. Ban just give us give us a bit of your take on that what you were saying there. Well, there was this dispute which was arisen out of previous evidence we heard from Gavin Williamson about how much preparation there was and evidence from the permanent secretary at the Department for Education about there not being any contingency plans for schools closing. And it's worth just underlining why this is really important because there was a big impact as we've been discussing about the shutdowns on children. Maybe they should have done it, maybe they shouldn't. But if you were going to do it, you'd want the government to be prepared in some way to make this as uh as as painless as possible. But if decision is is quite a sort of I'm not going to say an easy decision, but it's like shut them or not. It's then all the consequences that come from that that you have to then mitigate. Exactly. So things like we were talking about laptops, have you got laptops ready? Have you got a plan for vulnerable children? Have you got a plan for children who who need to go to school to eat properly? All these things. But it looks like according to the evidence from Gavin Williamson and the department for education permanent secretary that there had been none of that planning. So Boris Johnson was challenged on this today and he said he didn't really recognize that. He said well they were talking about shutting the schools and as far as I was concerned these they were making plans. So there was a very direct contradiction between what we'd heard from the department education department and what we heard from Boris Johnson today. So we at verify looked at these evidence. I think as as Boris Johnson said he is right that sage the advis scientific advisory council did discuss school closures and it was clearly being discussed within government as a possibility but that's not the same as contingency planning. So they can both be true at the same time. According to the people who were actually in charge operationally of schools, there was no contingency planning. And we heard nothing today to really say that that wasn't true. And it was very clear that in as much as they were thinking about it, they were thinking, well, what happens to an individual school if half the teachers are ill and we have to somehow keep the education going for everyone else? There wasn't any large-scale planning for what happened if you closed all the schools for most of the children all at the same time. And in fact, what was surfaced today and they showed some of it at the inquiry was a hasty three pager which was drawn up on the day before it was announced to parents. And in that there were some interesting details. It was clear they understood that if you took free school meals away, they couldn't begin to get food vouchers, for example, to children for a month. There was no mention at all of vulnerable children and how to look after them. Although I saw a memo that they flashed up on the screen, there was some bullet points from the Department for Education around that period that spelt out very clearly all the consequences that we then all lived through. And I was like, ""Oh, actually, there were some people very aware of where this would lead."" That was from March the 17th, 2020. The announcement was made on March the 18th, 2020. We heard in previous evidence um from Gavin Williamson that an email arrived at 8:45 p.m. saying, ""Right, okay, we've decided we are going to shut schools."" And officials worked through the night to try and pull things together. So for something that's that large scale affecting 9 million children, it's not a three pages does not go a long way. And not trying to prejudge the outcome of the inquiry, but having read the previous report from the inquiry and watched hours of the the interrogation of other ministers and other subjects, you can see there's two things that the inquiry just keep pushing at and highlighting, which is the sort of the failure of imagination. like you can't if you if you're not prepared, if you're not thinking about the worst, you can't really prepare for the worst. And then also just the the white hole decision-making, who was actually in charge and what sort of assumptions were made about who else might be doing something if the prime minister isn't directly saying right, we're doing this now, plan for this tomorrow. A and an extraordinarily massive sort of don't think culture in some ways. So if the message from the center is well this is a remote possibility that a department wouldn't then galvanize itself to think well it might happen so we need to have a plan just in case. M I think it is it is worth making the point that it is still disputed very vigorously about whether it was right or wrong to shut the schools in fact in terms of dealing with the virus and people can have legitimate views on both sides of that but I think including Boris Johnson who holds both position changed his mind he was very conflicted you could see that but the issue is you should still plan for it if you're going if it's a serious possibility even if you don't want to do it why isn't government why isn't the department for education why isn't downing street getting a plan together say if you do have to do what you don't want to do or you hope you won't have to do to get ready for it. And I think that's where I suspect the uh the inquiry will will find criticism. And there's one thing for everyone to hold in mind which is virtually the whole world closed schools in that spring of 2020 and before the UK did and before the UK did. So a places like Italy could have been a warning signal for the UK, but also it wasn't a decision that looked irrational to many governments in that context at that time. And then if we fast forward to the the second school closure decision, which was at the very beginning of January 2021, I mean, the decision-m around that seems well, we know at the time it was very ragged. Schools opened and then closed the next day. I have such a vivid memory of being in a primary school in Warrington at parents really relieved in many ways that their kids could come back and see their friends and their teachers and then sitting in a van outside that same school uh watching the prime minister say actually we've decided we have to close them and we're cancelelling exams again. And we heard today about a key meeting that had happened during that day in which they'd looked at the data around the new variant, the alpha variant. And he said it was that scientific data which had convinced them that although they wanted to open schools, they couldn't. But up to that, the conversation in government had been about what level of testing do you have and what kind of staggering of different year groups do you have going back. They weren't talking about, oh, bring them all, bring all the children home again. Yeah. Well, I remember being on the other side of it at the school gate, you know, dropping your children off, thinking, we're out of this, you know, thank God, and then being pulled back into this, it was a it was an incredibly tough time. I think that was probably one of the bleakest moments actually that January 2021 given the number the surging number of deaths and that sense of we're going back into this again and the government, it felt to many parents that they just didn't have a grip on what was going on. The fact that you were in and out like that just doesn't breed confidence. And I mean, I didn't watch Gavin Williamson's evidence when he was giving it a few days ago, but the the KC was referring to it in the questioning of Boris Johnson today, and she said, ""Oh, he sort of suggests that actually the decision to close schools in 2021 wasn't really necessarily about schools. It was more about getting everyone in the population to follow all the rules."" And if you wanted to do that, maybe you would say, ""We're even shutting the schools. That's why we're shutting everything else. You got to follow we're throwing everything at this."" It was almost like part of a I mean, the the inquiry didn't use this this word, but it was almost like a sort of propaganda thing to encourage behavior elsewhere. The word messaging was used by Gavin Williamson that that's what he thought it was largely about and that this metaphor had been used um about smashing a Ming vase on the floor just to get the point across and that was the closure of schools. Today, Boris Johnson was pretty emphatic that it wasn't just about that. They were genuinely concerned about the spread of the virus and the virus going back into households and what that would mean. And then um Braman, you you alluded to the exams fiasco and I think we can call it a fiasco. Everyone widely calls it that now. In summer 2020 when there was the infamous algorithm that was deciding pupil's grades for them. What did Boris Johnson say about that? So he said that it was a bad decision uh that they should have known sooner. They shouldn't have implemented it and that the public outrage was absolutely huge and he fully fully acknowledged that. What I was really struck by was if you reel back to 2020 at the time, he was calling it a mutant algorithm, suggesting that it somehow had a mind of its own and had gone off and concocted these exam results. And what we've heard over the last couple of weeks is that there were warnings from senior school leaders as earlier as a April saying, look, this doesn't look as though it's going to be terribly fair for a lot of students. Are you really really sure about this? and that there was a doubling down because they wanted to make sure that there wasn't grade inflation. What was read out in the inquiry today was a message from Boris Johnson at the time to Dominic Cummings basically saying um and I'm paraphrasing this. No, I'm going to read it. I'm going to read it out because I did I did a um screen grab of it because that's what I like to do when Boris Johnson's WhatsApp messages appear on the big screen. Um, I'll not use the first few words because it involves a swear word, but he's talking about a newspaper reporting this situation which has messed up. Um, quote, ""The remnants of my Scottish break. So, I'm back in checkers and in a thoroughly homicidal mood. We need a plan for the Department of Education. We need a permanent secretary, in other words, the most senior civil servant. And we need better ministers. And quite frankly, we need an agenda of reform. We can't go on like this. I'm thinking of going into number 10 and firing people."" That's the message. and note the people multiple because some people today have said was that him intending to sack um Gavin Williamson. Um also heavily involved in the exams decisions at the time were was Nick Gibb who was a very very experienced schools minister very concerned about standards and he had been involved in a lot of the nitty-gritty. In the end, neither of the politicians walked the plank. It was the permanent secretary, the most senior civil servant, uh, Jon Jonathan Slater who was made to leave and to fall on his sword to take off some of the heat from the public outcry around this. And also there was an interesting memo on the screen in the room from Helen McNamara the deputy cabinet secretary who's been quite prominent in all of this and she was sort of starting to ask the questions about why the algorithm had gone wrong saying things like oh when when was it decided that grade inflation prevention was the main thing here because if you decided something else you would have gone down a different route. I think that's really important. So Boris Johnson in his testimony said well he got quite indignant right at the end saying well you try and devise a way of being fair to all pupils and keeping that angriest moment and that is true. It is very very hard to do that given you weren't sitting exams to to to devise a system. The real question is did they privilege not uh stopping grade to stopping grade inflation over fairness and why was that decision taken? who took it and you know who was responsible for uh to carry the can for that. They didn't quite get to that for me. He Boris John was apologetic. He said look this he admitted it was a fiasco and obviously they had to completely scrap the system that they devised in very short order. But it seems to me that the really important political point is who had made that decision and why because that was the source of it actually. If they'd gone for the system, the centrally assessed grades first of all, they could have avoided all this, but they chose not to. Someone was saying the most important priority for government is to stop grade inflation. And a lot of people would question whether they had their priorities right. A and across the UK, it's worth remembering there are four exams regulators. They all broadly used the same algorithm. Um because Scottish results come out a week earlier. Nicholas Sturgeon had called it pretty quickly and said, ""Okay, we're going to U-turn on this. It hasn't worked. It's clearly not fair."" The Alevel results in England were a week later. And it took days and protests and people pointing out that if you've got a system which even if it's only unfair and and only perhaps is the wrong word for a minority of students for each of their students it's 100% of their future. Yeah. So if you have gone through school getting largely A's and B's or the equivalent and you get to A levels and because the algorithm because you're doing a large subject with with lots of people taking it, you get a D or an E, you know, you are not happy. Yeah. Um and also that Helen McNamara email, it's quite interesting just seeing the the language that is used for the to towards the prime minister of like you will want to decide to do something like X. Please let us know if you want some options of X, Y, and Zed while we suggest you do X. So, it's just amazing getting the insight into just how these things are done. Um, Braman, um, anything else that that we haven't covered yet? I think the the other thing really was around what should happen once they recognize that there've been a huge impact on schools and kids education. Um, what should happen afterwards? There was a lot of discussion about Sir Kevin Collins, an education expert who was appointed as recovery zar by Boris Johnson with great fanfare and and who wanted to spend 15 billion pounds. He wanted to spend 15 billion pounds. And his grand vision was to make school super attractive by extending the school day and putting in sports, arts, creative subjects, drama, stuff that would get kids back into school, which arguably sitting where we are now, where we know that attendance is still not fully recovered, might have been a smart idea. What Boris Johnson said today was yes, I let him come up with a grand plan and then I had to make difficult decisions about how much we were spending on COVID recovery across the whole of the UK in different parts of the economy and it just felt like 10 billion too much. So we gave him five billion for tutoring for which there was a solid evidence base. I think it's right interesting that because Boris Johnson said he stood by that decision. He said, ""I I don't think it would have been value for money to spend as much as Kevin Collins was recommending."" A lot of uh education experts at the time, I remember, were saying, ""Actually, this is a bit of a false economy."" There's a study by the Institute for Fiscal Studies which suggested at that time that not fully helping these children catch up could cost the British economy in the long term some 350 billion pounds. So if you put the 15 billion catch up in that context, it does look a bit like a false economy not to spend it. Now I think we're still going to have to wait for the evaluations to find out exactly whether the prime minister was right or Kevin Collins was right who still sticks to that view. But I think it is worth putting it in that context. You know, the lifelong damage to people's education and therefore their earning ability needs to be weighed in that. And also just think about it politically. There's a parallel universe where they spent the money. schools were completely revolutionized after this dreadful period. And Boris Johnson's legacy was reinventing education from the ashes of this disaster. But instead, his legacy is well the legacy that he has. And tutoring did make a difference. It's worth saying that, you know, there is evidence that it did help children catch up with lost learning, but that's really to think about children in a very narrow way, which is all about school and knowledge and getting them through exams rather than thinking about their emotional well-being, their social development, their ability to communicate and and connect with other people. All of which suffered hugely. And we we've seen a spike in mental health referrals for the most serious cases coming out of the COVID. We hear anecdotally about the lack of social skills and social confidence. I it's huge and of course that's hard to quantify. So hard to make the case to Treasury. Bramman, thank you very much. Thank you. And Ben, thanks to you too. Thank you, Adam. And around this time last week, we were doing an episode of Newscast and we got some breaking news from Washington DC that following a phone call between the two of them, Donald Trump was preparing to meet Vladimir Putin face to face in Hungary to talk about the fate of Ukraine. We now hear from the White House today on Tuesday. There are now no plans for the two men to meet. So, we will keep an eye on whether there's any outcome or consequences from that decision. And that's it for this episode of Newscast. We'll be back with another one very soon. Bye-bye."

The visit follows deadly attacks in Gaza over the weekend. Two Israeli soldiers were killed in an incident in Rafa. Dozens of Palestinians were killed in Israeli air strikes. While criticizing what he described as media cynicism, Mr. Vance said President Trump's plan is progressing as expected. I want to say that there is this weird attitude I've sensed in the American media, in the Western media, where there's almost this desire to root for failure. That every time something bad happens, that every time that there's an act of violence, there's this inclination to say, ""Oh, this is the end of the ceasefire. This is the end of the peace plan."" It's not the end. It is in fact exactly how this is going to have to happen. And when you have people who hate each other, who have been fighting against each other for a very long time, we are doing very well. We are in a very good place. We're going to have to keep working on it. But I think we have the team to do exactly that. Well, that was JD Vance. Let's go to our Middle East correspondent, Hugo Ba. Hugo, you were listening to the news conference and that clip. I suppose the question now is, is there a gap between the optimism we heard there and from Donald Trump and the reality on the ground? Yeah, Matthew, I thought it was very interesting that he, you know, tried to strike a positive tone during this news conference. He said he was very optimistic that the ceasefire was going to hold. He was very confident that uh these negotiations are going to succeed negotiations over those remaining remaining points of President Trump's plan for Gaza. He also seemed to downplay uh you know the deadly uh incidents uh in Gaza last weekend saying that those incidents were part of the process and at some points he tried he appeared to uh acknowledge the fact that these negotiations are going to be very difficult. Uh he said it was going to take uh some time to negotiate those remaining points. He also said he wouldn't give any kind of dead deadline for Hamas to disarm which is a key Israeli demand and a key obstacle in these uh negotiations. But again, he repeated uh the threat uh you know, President Trump's threat that if Hamas doesn't disarm uh and it doesn't fulfill its obligations, uh the group is going to be obliterated. And uh he also said the priorities right now are security for both Israel and Gaza, reconstruction of Gaza and the delivery of humanitarian aid. And again acknowledging uh the you know difficult discussions the lie ahead. He said he didn't know how the future governance of Gaza would look like and also he said that there haven't been discussions about this international force to secure Gaza. So again, he tried to strike a positive tone but acknowledging that these negotiations are going to be difficult and we've been talking about this for quite some time now since you know this plan was announced by President Trump that it is a plan that doesn't have you know uh lots of details about what happens next. There's no framework for these negotiations to take place and huge obstacles remain. Hugo PGA with the latest. Thanks very much."

It revolves around Ukraine. Several things to bring you right up to date because the White House first of all have been speaking and uh the first line to tell you is that that proposed summit between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin is not going to happen in the immediate future. We'd been getting a sense of that earlier in the day with the plan of Marco Rubio and Sergey Lavrov meeting. uh there were problems with laying the groundwork and already we'd uh heard that that was being pushed back. So there is no surprise that confirmation from the White House that the summit that was due to happen in Hungary perhaps as early as next week. There is no plans for that summit to go ahead in the immediate future. Now also at the same time some very interesting lines coming out of Kev because President Zilinski saying that Russia had quote almost automatically become less interested in diplomacy due to the postponement of a decision from Donald Trump on the US administration giving Ukraine Tomahawk missiles. You may remember Zilinski went to Washington. That was his big ask for tomahawk missiles and the president pouring cold water. And it was interesting because earlier on the program we were talking about just how badly that meeting went behind the scenes with apparently the Financial Times talking about President Trump using exploitives, shouting at President Silinski throwing maps off the table and then trying to pressurize Ukraine's leader into accepting giving over the Donbass in its entirety to Russia as part of a peace agreement. And that of course Ukraine has always said is Moscow's talking point. And interestingly in the last hour we've had officials in Keev describing Donald Trump's peace plan as going round in circles. So uh it gives you just a sense and look at that picture with the president Silinski head in hands because just giving you I suppose just a snapshot of the unhappiness of Friday's meeting. So no progress in that meeting. In fact, most of the analysis is that actually things have gone backwards and underlining that uh no sign of that Trump Putin summit.

Now a feature-length documentary called Spacewoman, which chronicles her trailblazing career, looks set to change that.
 
""As the first woman to pilot the Space Shuttle, I worked very hard at that because I didn't want people to say, 'Oh look, the woman has made a mistake'. Because it wasn't just about me, it was about the women to follow me,"" she says.

And now she's the subject of a new documentary called Spacewoman, which looks at her remarkable achievements and trailblazing career. Our science editor, Rebecca Morurell, went to meet her. Three engines up and burning. 3 and of Space Shuttle Discovery. She's the woman who smashed through the glass ceiling and then just kept on going. Eileen Collins made history as the first woman to pilot and command a spacecraft. In a way, it's going to be hard to come home because I do like being in space so much. It feels almost natural to be up here. Now, she's the subject of a new documentary, Spacewoman. So, take a look here. That's the heat shield on the bottom. You can see where there some of those pieces broke off. And we met her at the science museum. I was reading a magazine article on the Gemini astronauts. I was probably nine years old and I thought that's the coolest thing. That's what I want to do. Of course, there were no women back then, but I just thought I'll be a lady astronaut. But that little girl set her sights even higher. She wanted to be at the controls of a spacecraft. And the only way to achieve this was to become a test pilot in the military. After a decade in the Air Force, she had made it and was accepted by NASA. She was chosen to pilot her first mission in 1995. And the eyes of the world were on her. As the first woman to pilot the space shuttle, I didn't want people to say, ""Oh, look, the woman made a mistake."" Because it wasn't just about me. It was about the women to follow me and I wanted there to be a reputation for women pilots that was, hey, they're really good. She was so good she was quickly promoted to commander. Here, a job she juggled with being a mom to two young children. I felt like I had the two best jobs in the world. I was a mother and I was a space shuttle commander. I'm going to tell you, it is harder to be a parent than to be a space shuttle commander. But the best training I ever had for being a commander was being a parent because sometimes you have to say no. You have to learn how to say no to people. We have booster ignition and liftoff of Space Shuttle Columbia with But in 2003, the shuttle program experienced a catastrophic failure. As the Colombia spacecraft launched, a piece of foam broke loose, damaging its heat shield. The shuttle broke up as it re-entered the Earth's atmosphere, killing all seven astronauts on board. After a 2-year gap, Eileen Collins was chosen to command the next mission. Did she think about quitting? I think quitting the mission would have been very the opposite of brave. And I wanted to be a brave leader. I wanted to be a confident leader. I wanted to instill that confidence in other people. But during her launch, the nightmare scenario happened again. Some foam broke off. We were very surprised to hear that a large piece of foam had fallen up. And uh frankly, we were disappointed to hear that had happened. And no one knew what the damage was. The solution putting the shuttle through a 360 degree somersault closing at a rate of 1 and a half ft per second while it passed under the international space station. They are 650 ft. So astronauts could thoroughly check it out. It was something that had never been done before and there were engineers and managers saying that can't be done. That can't be done. You know, all these reasons why it's too dangerous. And after I listened to the discussion, they knew I was the commander. I said, ""It sounds like we can do it."" And it became just an elegant solution. And I loved it. The somersault revealed there was damage to the shuttle's underside and a spacew walk was needed to fix it. Steeper than that of a standard commercial airliner's descent. It meant the crew could safely make it home. The flight was over. And for Eene Collins, it was the last time she would go to space. So, what advice would the astronaut give to kids who share her dream? Do your homework. Listen to your teacher. Pay attention in class and read books and that will give them something to focus on. Eileen says she has no regrets about ending her astronaut career when she did. But if someone said, ""We got an extra space on that mission."" Would you would you be tempted? Yes, I would love to go on a mission someday when I'm an old lady. Maybe I'll get a chance to go back in space. Those that follow in her footsteps will learn just how much she achieved, not only as a woman, but as a formidable pilot and commander. Rebecca Morell, BBC News. And I'm really thrilled to say that Eileen Collins will be joining me in about an hour's time here on the set. Really looking forward to talking to her. What an inspiration and an incredible story and lots of advice and words of wisdom that she has to share with us as"
