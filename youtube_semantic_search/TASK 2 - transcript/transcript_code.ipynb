      "🔄 Processing 22/51: c] code we have one more opportunity for improving this code look there are multiple places where we have defined our choices this is bad for two reasons one reason is that if we have a typo in our code our program is not going to work that's number one problem the second problem is that if tomorrow we decide to change our choices from R S and P to something else like 1 2 and three there are multiple places that we have to modify in programming we have this principle called dry which is short for don't repeat yourself so we don't want to have repetition or duplication in our code most of the time it's a bad practice practice so how can we solve this problem well we can generate this top hole based on this dictionary in this dictionary we have three key value pairs our keys are R S and P so let me show you how we can convert this dictionary to a tople with these values first I'm going to select this line and the rest of the code now we can convert all these lines to a comment by pressing command and slash on Mac or control and slash on Windows now all these lines are commented out so they're not going to get executed we only have the Declaration of our dictionary now let's print emojis dot look here we have a method called keys which Returns the keys of this dictionary using this structure dict keys let me show you so back to the terminal let's run our program all right here's what we get we get an object of type dict keys or dictionary keys and here we have R S and P but this is not exactly what we want what we want is a topple but this is very easy to fix we can pass the object that is returned from this method to the topple function and with this we get a top hole exactly like the top hole that we declared here so we can set choices to top hole of emojis do Keys okay with this technique we remov duplication in our code now let's bring back all the code here so one more time we press command and slash on Mac or control and slash on Windows okay now look there are other places where we have repeated our choices again if we have a typo our program is not going to work so realistically we need a single place for defining our choices to do that we can go to the top and declare a bunch of constants by convention we use uppercase letters to declare constants so we can declare a constant like rock and set it to R similarly scissors and paper this is a single place where we declare our choices now anywhere we have R S and P we replace them with our constants so I have selected R here now to select the next occurrence of R in this code we press command and D on Mac or control and D on Windows look this instance is also selected one more time we press command and D there you go now we have three cursors all of them selecting R so we can replace them all with rock in one go now to cancel multic cursor editing we press the escape button twice okay one more time we're going to select s we press command and D twice to select these two instances as well and replace this with scissors again we press the skape button twice done and the last one paper okay now we have a single place where we have defined our choices so no chance for typos and if we decide to change the choices from RS and P to something else in the future there is a single place we have to update we can change this to one two and three and everything will work okay but there is another benefit here look down here where we determine the winner our code is more descriptive so instead of comparing user choice and computer Choice with r and s we can clearly see that if the user has a rock and the computer has scissors the user is the winner hey there I hope you've been enjoying this video so far if you're finding this helpful and want to take your python skills even further I've got something really exciting for you this video is just a taste of what you will find in my full course python projects for beginners in the full course we dive deep into more projects covering a wide range of Concepts that will help you sharpen your problem solving skills and become a confident python programmer if you're ready to level up check out the link below to get access to the full course I would love to see you there and help you on your python Journey all right for our next project we're going to build a QR code generator so first we enter some text or URL I'm going to enter the address of my website code with mos.com next we enter a file name let's enter m.jpg now we have a QR code saved in this file this file is right here so this is the QR code for my we it if you scan this with your phone it will open your browser and take you to my website now to build this we're going to use a thirdparty library called QR code so head over to p.org proqr code read the documentation for this Library the purpose of this project is to get you familiar with using thirdparty libraries so this project doesn't have really complex logic it's all about the right way to use third party packages so I spend a few minutes to go through the documentation then install this library and build this project all right the first thing we're going to do is set up a virtual environment a virtual environment in Python is like a separate isolated workspace on your computer where you can install packages and run python projects think of it as a clean organized room that's separate from the rest of your house in this room you have everything you need to work on a specific Project without affecting anything else in the house now why do we need a virtual environment well imagine you're working on two different python projects one project needs an older version of a library and the other project needs a newer version if you install both versions globally for the whole computer they might conflict with each other a virtual environment solves this problem by allowing each project to have its own separate environment with its own specific versions of libraries okay so to set up a virtual environment here we open the terminal window and type python if you're on Windows or Python 3 if you're on Mac then we type-m that is short for module we're going to run this module VM that's one of the built-in modules in Python for creating virtual environments and then we specify a name for our virtual environment by convention we often use VMV as well okay now vs code is saying we noticed a new virtual environment has been created do you want to selected for the workspace folder for now select no we come back to this later now take a look at the project directory we have this new folder here VM and inside this we have a bunch of folders like bin include and lip inside the bin folder we have executables like pip pip 3 python python 3 and so on now if you're a bit more experienced and are familiar with Git You can see that we have over a th000 files ready to be committed to our Repository we don't want to include these files in our repository so to exclude them here in the root of our project we add a new file called dogit ignore in this file we add the files and folders We want to exclude from our git repository in this case VN folder so we add a forward slash here okay now if you're not familiar with Git don't worry about it just ignore this step for now okay so we have created a virtual environment but current L it's not active so we go back to the terminal to activate it if you're on Windows you type VM back slash scripts back slash activate if you're on Mac you type Source VN slash bin SL activate Okay now look this virtual environment is activated so any packages that we install will be installed in this virtual environment or in this isolated workspace when we are done with this project we can deactivate this virtual environment by typing deactivate okay now let's activate it one more time good now in this virtual environment we're going to install the QR code package all right good with this installed now we add a new file to our project QR code generator. Pi first we import the QR code module next we use the input function and tell the user to enter some text or URL we get the result and store it in a variable called Data next we use the input function to get a file name so enter the file name and rest store it here now it's a good practice to remove any white spaces around what the user types for example what if the user types let's say the address of my website as the URL whether they type this address or this address followed by a whites space we want to have the same QR code generator so over here we can call the strip method to get rid of any white spaces around our data okay similarly I would like to strip any white spaces around the file name good now we ready to generate our QR code to do that we go in the QR code module and create create a QR code object here we want to set two parameters one is box size I'm going to set it to 10 these are just arbitrary values I'm going to set border to four this returns a QR code object we store it in this variable next we call qr. add data then we pass our data next we call qr. make image and set two arguments here one is fill color which I'm going to set to Black again these are arbitrary values you can use any colors you want we also set back color to white this returns an image that we store in a variable and finally we call image. saave to save it in this file and at the end we print QR code saved as now here we want to add the file name so let's convert this to a formatted string and insert the file name here now let's run our program so I'm going to enter the address of my website code with m.com and for the file name I'm going to enter m.jpg okay now look in this folder we have mh. jpg this is my QR code so if you point your phone at this and scan it this will open your browser and take you to my website hey there I hope you've been enjoying this video so far if if you're finding this helpful and want to take your python skills even further I've got something really exciting for you this video is just a taste of what you will find in my full course python projects for beginners in the full course we dive deep into more projects covering a wide range of Concepts that will help you sharpen your problem solving skills and become a confident python programmer if you're ready to level up check out the link below to get access to the full course I would love to see you there and help you on your python Journey\n",

our choices this is bad for two reasons one reason is that if we have a typo in our code our program is not going to work that's number one problem the second problem is that if tomorrow we decide to change our choices from R S and P to something else like 1 2 and three there are multiple places that we have to modify in programming we have this principle called dry which is short for don't repeat yourself so we don't want to have repetition or duplication in our code most of the time it's a bad practice practice so how can we solve this problem well we can generate this top hole based on this dictionary in this dictionary we have three key value pairs our keys are R S and P so let me show you how we can convert this dictionary to a tople with these values first I'm going to select this line and the rest of the code now we can convert all these lines to a comment by pressing command and slash on Mac or control and slash on Windows now all these lines are commented out so they're not going to get executed we only have the Declaration of our dictionary now let's print emojis dot look here we have a method called keys which Returns the keys of this dictionary using this structure dict keys let me show you so back to the terminal let's run our program all right here's what we get we get an object of type dict keys or dictionary keys and here we have R S and P but this is not exactly what we want what we want is a topple but this is very easy to fix we can pass the object that is returned from this method to the topple function and with this we get a top hole exactly like the top hole that we declared here so we can set choices to top hole of emojis do Keys okay with this technique we remov duplication in our code now let's bring back all the code here so one more time we press command and slash on Mac or control and slash on Windows okay now look there are other places where we have repeated our choices again if we have a typo our program is not going to work so realistically we need a single place for defining our choices to do that we can go to the top and declare a bunch of constants by convention we use uppercase letters to declare constants so we can declare a constant like rock and set it to R similarly scissors and paper this is a single place where we declare our choices now anywhere we have R S and P we replace them with our constants so I have selected R here now to select the next occurrence of R in this code we press command and D on Mac or control and D on Windows look this instance is also selected one more time we press command and D there you go now we have three cursors all of them selecting R so we can replace them all with rock in one go now to cancel multic cursor editing we press the escape button twice okay one more time we're going to select s we press command and D twice to select these two instances as well and replace this with scissors again we press the skape button twice done and the last one paper okay now we have a single place where we have defined our choices so no chance for typos and if we decide to change the choices from RS and P to something else in the future there is a single place we have to update we can change this to one two and three and everything will work okay but there is another benefit here look down here where we determine the winner our code is more descriptive so instead of comparing user choice and computer Choice with r and s we can clearly see that if the user has a rock and the computer has scissors the user is the winner hey there I hope you've been enjoying this video so far if you're finding this helpful and want to take your python skills even further I've got something really exciting for you this video is just a taste of what you will find in my full course python projects for beginners in the full course we dive deep into more projects covering a wide range of Concepts that will help you sharpen your problem solving skills and become a confident python programmer if you're ready to level up check out the link below to get access to the full course I would love to see you there and help you on your python Journey all right for our next project we're going to build a QR code generator so first we enter some text or URL I'm going to enter the address of my website code with mos.com next we enter a file name let's enter m.jpg now we have a QR code saved in this file this file is right here so this is the QR code for my we it if you scan this with your phone it will open your browser and take you to my website now to build this we're going to use a thirdparty library called QR code so head over to p.org proqr code read the documentation for this Library the purpose of this project is to get you familiar with using thirdparty libraries so this project doesn't have really complex logic it's all about the right way to use third party packages so I spend a few minutes to go through the documentation then install this library and build this project all right the first thing we're going to do is set up a virtual environment a virtual environment in Python is like a separate isolated workspace on your computer where you can install packages and run python projects think of it as a clean organized room that's separate from the rest of your house in this room you have everything you need to work on a specific Project without affecting anything else in the house now why do we need a virtual environment well imagine you're working on two different python projects one project needs an older version of a library and the other project needs a newer version if you install both versions globally for the whole computer they might conflict with each other a virtual environment solves this problem by allowing each project to have its own separate environment with its own specific versions of libraries okay so to set up a virtual environment here we open the terminal window and type python if you're on Windows or Python 3 if you're on Mac then we type-m that is short for module we're going to run this module VM that's one of the built-in modules in Python for creating virtual environments and then we specify a name for our virtual environment by convention we often use VMV as well okay now vs code is saying we noticed a new virtual environment has been created do you want to selected for the workspace folder for now select no we come back to this later now take a look at the project directory we have this new folder here VM and inside this we have a bunch of folders like bin include and lip inside the bin folder we have executables like pip pip 3 python python 3 and so on now if you're a bit more experienced and are familiar with Git You can see that we have over a th000 files ready to be committed to our Repository we don't want to include these files in our repository so to exclude them here in the root of our project we add a new file called dogit ignore in this file we add the files and folders We want to exclude from our git repository in this case VN folder so we add a forward slash here okay now if you're not familiar with Git don't worry about it just ignore this step for now okay so we have created a virtual environment but current L it's not active so we go back to the terminal to activate it if you're on Windows you type VM back slash scripts back slash activate if you're on Mac you type Source VN slash bin SL activate Okay now look this virtual environment is activated so any packages that we install will be installed in this virtual environment or in this isolated workspace when we are done with this project we can deactivate this virtual environment by typing deactivate okay now let's activate it one more time good now in this virtual environment we're going to install the QR code package all right good with this installed now we add a new file to our project QR code generator. Pi first we import the QR code module next we use the input function and tell the user to enter some text or URL we get the result and store it in a variable called Data next we use the input function to get a file name so enter the file name and rest store it here now it's a good practice to remove any white spaces around what the user types for example what if the user types let's say the address of my website as the URL whether they type this address or this address followed by a whites space we want to have the same QR code generator so over here we can call the strip method to get rid of any white spaces around our data okay similarly I would like to strip any white spaces around the file name good now we ready to generate our QR code to do that we go in the QR code module and create create a QR code object here we want to set two parameters one is box size I'm going to set it to 10 these are just arbitrary values I'm going to set border to four this returns a QR code object we store it in this variable next we call qr. add data then we pass our data next we call qr. make image and set two arguments here one is fill color which I'm going to set to Black again these are arbitrary values you can use any colors you want we also set back color to white this returns an image that we store in a variable and finally we call image. saave to save it in this file and at the end we print QR code saved as now here we want to add the file name so let's convert this to a formatted string and insert the file name here now let's run our program so I'm going to enter the address of my website code with m.com and for the file name I'm going to enter m.jpg okay now look in this folder we have mh. jpg this is my QR code so if you point your phone at this and scan it this will open your browser and take you to my website hey there I hope you've been enjoying this video so far if if you're finding this helpful and want to take your python skills even further I've got something really exciting for you this video is just a taste of what you will find in my full course python projects for beginners in the full course we dive deep into more projects covering a wide range of Concepts that will help you sharpen your problem solving skills and become a confident python programmer if you're ready to level up check out the link below to get access to the full course I would love to see you there and help you on your python Journey!
